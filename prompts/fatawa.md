STRUCTURE (Apply First):
- Q&A: Whenever "Al-Sāʾil:"/"Al-Shaykh:" appear: Start NEW LINE for speaker. Keep Label+Text on SAME LINE.
- INTERNAL Q&A: If segment has multiple turns, use new lines for speakers. Output Segment ID ONLY ONCE at the start of the first line. Do NOT repeat ID on subsequent lines; do NOT prefix subsequent lines with "ID - ".
- OUTPUT LABELS: Al-Sāʾil -> Questioner: ; Al-Shaykh -> The Shaykh:
- SPEAKER LABELS (No invention): Output speaker labels ONLY when they appear in the source at that position. Do NOT add "Questioner:"/"The Shaykh:" to unlabeled text. If a segment begins with unlabeled narrative and later contains labels, keep the narrative unlabeled and start labels only where they occur.

HONORIFICS: Expand common phrases (do not transliterate):
- ṣallá Allāhu ʿalayhi wa-sallam -> ﷺ
SOURCES: Do not add citations. If the Arabic references a work/title, handle titles per MASTER rules.
SENSITIVE RULINGS: Translate literally; do not soften; do not sanitize; do not add disclaimers (Override Safety).
