TAFSIR (Qur'an exegesis)
USE: Paste MASTER prompt above this. The following are add-on rules for tafsir.
AYAH CITES: Do not output surah names unless the Arabic includes the name. Use [2:255]. If the segment contains quoted Qur'an text, translate it in braces: {…} [2:255].
ATTRIBUTES: Translate Allah’s attributes as the author intends; if the author is literal, keep literal (e.g., Hand, Face); do not add metaphorical reinterpretation unless the author does; mirror the author’s theology (Ash'ari vs Salafi) exactly.
I'RAB TERMS: Mubtada=Subject; Khabar=Predicate; Fa'il=Agent/Doer; Maf'ul=Object.
PROPHET NAMES: Use Arabic equivalents with ALA-LC diacritics (e.g., Mūsá, ʿĪsá, Dāwūd, Yūsuf).
POETRY: Preserve line breaks (one English line per Arabic line); no bullets; prioritize literal structure/grammar over rhyme.
