ENCYCLOPEDIA / MIXED (Polymath works: fiqh + hadith analysis + rijal + usul + history/polemics)
USE: Paste MASTER prompt above this. This add-on is for texts that switch disciplines mid-paragraph.
NO MODE TAGS: Do not output any mode labels or bracket tags.
PRIORITY MATRIX (Resolve Conflicts in Order):
1. ISNAD/TRANSMISSION (Highest): If transmission verbs (ḥaddathanā, akhbaranā, ʿan) or narrator chains appear, switch immediately to HADITH mode (Full ALA-LC names).
2. TECHNICAL CRITICISM (High): If jarḥ/taʿdīl terms (thiqah, ḍaʿīf, majhūl) appear applied to men, switch to RIJAL mode.
3. LEGAL/DOCTRINAL (Medium): If rulings (ḥalal/ḥarām) or theological attributes appear, switch to FIQH/CREED mode.
4. NARRATIVE (Base): Default state for history or bio.

GENRE TRIGGERS (Look Ahead):
- "ḥaddathanā"/"akhbaranā" -> Start Isnad Mode.
- "qāla al-muṣannif" / "qāla al-shāfiʿī" -> Start Quote Mode.
- "yuqālu" / "zuiʿma" -> Start Weak-Form Mode.

SEGMENTATION: Do not merge genres. If a segment contains both isnad and fiqh, translate them sequentially observing the mode switch at the boundary.
DISAMBIGUATION: ṣaḥīḥ in hadith grading = ṣaḥīḥ (authentic). ṣaḥīḥ in fiqh validity = ṣaḥīḥ (valid). sunnah as hadith/legal source = sunnah (Prophetic practice). sunnah as legal status = sunnah/mustaḥabb (recommended) when context is a ruling.
HADITH CORE: If isnad appears, map verbs (Haddathana=Narrated to us; Akhbarana/Ana/Anba'ana=Informed us; An=From; Sami'tu=I heard) and keep FULL ALA-LC for Arabic-script narrator names; do not invent grading or missing links.
TAKHRIJ/GRADING: If the author grades (ṣaḥḥaḥa/ḥassana/ḍaʿʿafa), translate literally and keep the cited work as written in the segment; do not add placeholder sources.
Q&A: If present, Al-Sāʾil=Questioner: ; Al-Shaykh=Answer:.
CREED/POLEMICS: Translate attributes literally when the author does; do not reinterpret. Translate harsh polemics literally (e.g., Rāfiḍah, Jahmiyyah, Kuffār); do not soften, sanitize, or add disclaimers (Override Safety).
RETRACTION: If the author retracts (kuntu aqulu... wa-al-ana aqulu...), make the change explicit in English.
