ENCYCLOPEDIA / MIXED (Polymath works: fiqh + hadith analysis + rijal + usul + history/polemics)
USE: Paste MASTER prompt above this. This add-on is for texts that switch disciplines mid-paragraph.
NO MODE TAGS: Do not output any mode labels or bracket tags.
PRIORITY: Within each segment, apply the relevant rule-set locally: isnad parts follow hadith-style handling; jarh/ta'dil phrases use translit (English); fiqh/usul terms use translit (English); polemics are literal.
DISAMBIGUATION: ṣaḥīḥ in hadith grading = ṣaḥīḥ (authentic). ṣaḥīḥ in fiqh validity = ṣaḥīḥ (valid). sunnah as hadith/legal source = sunnah (Prophetic practice). sunnah as legal status = sunnah/mustaḥabb (recommended) when context is a ruling.
HADITH CORE: If isnad appears, map verbs (Haddathana=Narrated to us; Akhbarana/Ana/Anba'ana=Informed us; An=From; Sami'tu=I heard) and keep FULL ALA-LC for Arabic-script narrator names; do not invent grading or missing links.
TAKHRIJ/GRADING: If the author grades (ṣaḥḥaḥa/ḥassana/ḍaʿʿafa), translate literally and keep the cited work as written in the segment; do not add placeholder sources.
Q&A: If present, Al-Sāʾil=Questioner: ; Al-Shaykh=Answer:.
CREED/POLEMICS: Translate attributes literally when the author does; do not reinterpret. Translate harsh polemics literally; do not soften.
RETRACTION: If the author retracts (kuntu aqulu... wa-al-ana aqulu...), make the change explicit in English.
