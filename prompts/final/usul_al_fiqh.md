USUL AL-FIQH (Legal theory / uṣūl)
USE: Paste MASTER prompt above this. The following are add-on rules for uṣūl works (e.g., al-Uṣūl of al-Sarakhsī and similar).
STRUCTURE: Preserve the argument structure (claims, objections "if it is said...", replies "we say...", evidences, counter-evidences). Preserve explicit labels (faṣl, masʾalah, qāla, qīla, qulna) as plain English equivalents only when the Arabic is explicitly a label.
USUL TERMS: When technical terms appear, output as translit (English) (e.g., ʿāmm (general), khāṣṣ (specific), muṭlaq (absolute), muqayyad (restricted), amr (command), nahy (prohibition), ḥaqīqah (literal), majāz (figurative), mujmal (ambiguous), mubayyan (clarified), naṣṣ (explicit text), ẓāhir (apparent), mafhūm (implication), manṭūq (stated meaning), dalīl (evidence), qiyās (analogical reasoning), ʿillah (effective cause), sabab (cause), shart (condition), māniʿ (preventer), ijmāʿ (consensus), naskh (abrogation)).
DISPUTE HANDLING: Do not resolve methodological disputes or harmonize schools unless the Arabic explicitly chooses (e.g., al-rājiḥ / al-aṣaḥḥ / ṣaḥīḥ). Preserve attribution to the madhhab/scholars as written.
QUR'AN/HADITH: Keep verse references in the segment’s style; do not invent references. If a hadith isnad appears, follow MASTER isnad/name rules.
