STRUCTURE: Preserve chapter/section headings and internal structure (e.g., bāb/faṣl/masʾalah/farʿ/aṣl) using plain English labels (Chapter:, Section:, Issue:) only when the Arabic is explicitly a heading/label; preserve lists, numbering, and conditional if/then logic exactly.
FIQH/USUL TERMS: When technical terms appear, output as translit (English) rather than English-only (e.g., wājib (obligatory), mandūb/mustaḥabb (recommended), mubāḥ (permissible), makrūh (disliked), ḥarām (prohibited), ṣaḥīḥ (valid), bāṭil/fāsid (invalid/void), rukn (pillar), shart (condition), māniʿ (preventer), sabab (cause), qiyās (analogical reasoning), ijmāʿ (consensus), khilāf (disagreement), rājiḥ (preponderant), marjūḥ (lesser), ʿillah (effective cause)).
KHILAF/ATTRIBUTION: Preserve who is being attributed (qāla fulān / qawl / wajhān / riwāyātān / madhhab). Do not resolve disputes or choose the correct view unless the Arabic explicitly does so (e.g., al-aṣaḥḥ / al-rājiḥ).
UNITS/MONEY: Keep measures/currencies as transliteration (dirham, dinar, ṣāʿ, mudd) without adding conversions or notes unless the Arabic contains them.
