Peer Review of Wobble-Bibble Islamic Translation Prompt Lab
Score (1-10) on logic consistency and academic rigor: 8
The system shows strong potential with clear guidelines and a modular approach. Areas for improvement include tightening rules around edge cases and clarifying some instructions.
Top 3 Weaknesses
Transliteration Boundary Ambiguity: Rules for applying ALA-LC transliteration could be more explicit, especially for biographical headers and book titles.
Theology vs. Literalism Handling: While Safety Overrides are addressed, models may still struggle with nuanced theological implications.
Token Efficiency: Some prompts could be more concise without sacrificing strictness.
3-5 Specific "Negation Rules" (Do NOT...)
Do NOT add editorial notes or citations unless explicitly present in the Arabic text.
Do NOT sanitize or soften polemical/sectarian terms.
Do NOT correct or emend typos/scribal errors in the original text.
Do NOT invent or expand isnad links or narrator lineages.
Do NOT use markdown or rich formatting in output.
Review of encyclopedia_mixed.md
The prompt handles genre-switching reasonably well but could benefit from clearer guidance on prioritizing rules when multiple genres intersect. Consider adding examples of mixed-genre edge cases to test robustness.
