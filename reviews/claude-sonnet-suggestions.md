Your prompt is quite good! But here are some suggestions:

**Clarity improvements:**

1. **The "Allah" vs. "ilāh" rule is ambiguous**: What about when the text discusses gods of other religions, or uses الله in a general theological discussion? Consider: "Translate الله as Allah. Translate إله/آلهة as 'god/gods' when referring to false deities or the general concept of divinity."

2. **"Translate by meaning" needs clarification**: This is vague. Perhaps: "Prefer literal translations, but use natural English phrasing when literal translation would be unclear or ungrammatical. For idioms and figures of speech, prioritize conveying the intended meaning."

3. **Add example for ALA-LC edge cases**: What about kunya (أبو) or laqab (titles)? "Use ALA-LC for all proper names in chains: Abū Hurayrah, Ibn ʿUmar, al-Ḥasan al-Baṣrī."

**Structural suggestions:**

4. **Specify what to do with hadith grading terms**: Should حسنه الألباني be transliterated, translated, or both? "For hadith authentication terms (صحيح، حسن، ضعيف), use: ṣaḥīḥ, ḥasan, ḍaʿīf."

5. **Clarify poetry handling**: "Preserve the line breaks and structure of poetry, but translate the content into natural English prose unless maintaining poetic form is contextually important."

6. **Add guidance on footnotes/marginalia**: If the source has them, what should be done?

**Process improvements:**

7. **Reorder the revision passes** for better logic:
   - First pass: Transliteration accuracy (catch errors early before they propagate)
   - Second pass: Context and terminology accuracy
   - Third pass: Verify numeric markers align with Arabic text

8. **Add a consistency check**: "Ensure technical terms are translated consistently throughout (e.g., don't alternate between 'narrator' and 'transmitter' for راوي)."

9. **Handle ambiguous segments explicitly**: "If a passage is genuinely ambiguous or could be interpreted multiple ways, provide your best translation and briefly note the ambiguity in [brackets]." (Though this conflicts with your plain-text requirement - you'd need to decide if you want this capability)

**Technical additions:**

10. **Specify treatment of Quranic verses**: Are they embedded in the hadith? "For Quranic quotations, translate them and note the surah:ayah reference if identifiable."

11. **Diacritics consistency**: "Use full diacritics in ALA-LC transliteration (ḥ, ṣ, ḍ, ṭ, ẓ, ʿ, ʾ)."

12. **Honorifics beyond ﷺ**: What about رضي الله عنه (raḍiya Allāhu ʿanhu) for companions? Should this be transliterated or use a symbol?

**Potential issue:**

13. **"No markdown or formatting"** - This might hurt readability for longer passages. Consider allowing minimal formatting like line breaks between hadiths or indentation for chains vs. matn (hadith text body). Even just "Use line breaks to separate distinct hadiths or sections" would help.

The strongest recommendation: **Add 1-2 example translations** (even just a short hadith with chain) showing exactly what you want. This is worth more than paragraphs of instructions.
