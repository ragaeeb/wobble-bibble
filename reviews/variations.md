## Usage Notes for These Complex Prompts:

**For al-Ṭabarī and similar comprehensive tafsīr:**
- Expect long isnāds before each interpretation
- Multiple opinions will be presented sequentially
- Linguistic discussions may be interspersed with fiqh rulings
- Be prepared for Isrāʾīliyyāt (narratives from Jewish/Christian sources)

**For al-Albānī's Silsilah and similar authentication works:**
- Author's voice is prominent ("I say...", "it appears to me...")
- Extensive cross-referencing between hadith collections
- Detailed defect analysis with technical jargon
- Responses to other scholars' gradings

**For Rijāl works:**
- Highly formulaic biographical entries
- Many variant name spellings to track
- Contradictory scholarly opinions are common
- Dates may be approximate or disputed
