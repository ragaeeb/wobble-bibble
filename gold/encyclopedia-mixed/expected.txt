P1 - Questioner: Is a merchant who stored merchandise at an old price permitted to raise its price in the event of rising prices? May Allah reward you with good…?
Shaykh: Of course it is permissible; for trade does not occur except like this. But we must distinguish between such saving (storing) when prices rise because of a shortage of goods, and we must distinguish that from iḥtikār (hoarding/monopoly). The Messenger, peace be upon him, says regarding the prohibition of iḥtikār: “Man iḥtakara fa-huwa khāṭiʾ” (whoever hoards is khāṭiʾ). Pay attention to the Arabic: khāṭiʾ is not the same as mukhtaʾ.
Questioner: Excuse me — regarding the previous matter…

P1a - Shaykh: Yes, it is considered a condition; for you know that this sharīṭ (tape) that is recording now will benefit people in all the lands of the world, in shāʾ Allah.
