P5647 - Questioner: There is an addition to my question.
The Shaykh: Go ahead.
Questioner: Concerning now — in many, especially current, situations where there is extreme crowding and when returning from ʿArafah there are in Muzdalifah many people who do not spend the night in Muzdalifah — is merely standing now in Muzdalifah for a moment or for a short period considered al-mubayt (staying overnight) or is it incumbent upon them …

P5647a - The Shaykh: As for al-mubayt (staying overnight), one can say it is wājib (obligatory); whereas the rukn (pillar) is the ṣalāh of subh in congregation. Therefore, if a pilgrim did not al-mubayt and performed the subh ṣalāh there, then his ḥajj is complete and his tashrīk is done. But I want to draw your attention, regarding your question, that these pilgrims in fact perform Ḥajj while they do not distinguish between the rukn (pillar) and the wājib (obligatory) or the farḍ (duty) — "take your hand and go" — and on that basis I say: whoever first understands the sharʿī ruling and is well-versed in it, and if some obstacle prevents him from performing a rukn among those arkan, it is as if he performed all the arkan. Likewise, if some obstacle prevents him from performing one of these rukn, I say a word which I think I have not said before — I do not know whether it was because the occasion did not arise or because the Merciful did not inspire me with such an answer — which is: "lā yukallifu Allāhu nafsan illā wusʿahā" (He does not burden a soul beyond its capacity). From this verse and from some texts derived from it; for example his (peace be upon him) statement: "pray standing; if you cannot, then sitting; if you cannot, then on your side" — we know certainly that standing for the obligatory ṣalāh is a rukn, yet the prayer of the one unable to stand is not nullified; rather he is reduced to sitting, and if he cannot sit he is ordered to pray lying on his side. This hadith and many like it are derivations from the verse "lā yukallifu Allāhu nafsan illā wusʿahā" or "ittaqū Allāh mā istataʿtum" and the like. So now, a man was determined to pray subh in Muzdalifah, believing the Messenger said such-and-such, but an obstacle prevented him; so let him pray subh in the nearest place to Muzdalifah — obvious.
al-Ḥalabī: May Allah reward you well, our Shaykh; you relieved many people’s distress.
The Shaykh: Ma shāʾ Allāh.
al-Ḥalabī: Truly, by Allah.
The Shaykh: But I do not think so.
al-Ḥalabī: No, by Allah, praise be to God … we prayed by the grace of Allah.
The Shaykh: No, I do not think so because — I hope you noticed my caveat.
al-Ḥalabī: The caveat is correct, yes.
The Shaykh: If you noticed —
al-Ḥalabī: Yes, we noticed, our Shaykh.
The Shaykh: May Allah reward you.
al-Ḥalabī: Because even our brothers — some of our zealous brothers this year were prevented by the police; they prevented them from descending until the time of the ground (???).
The Shaykh: Understood — this is why I came with this detail; but I distinguish between one whose concern is to pray subh there and one whose concern is merely to roam to Mina and throw the pebbles and the matter ends.
al-Ḥalabī: Correct, correct; may Allah reward you.

P5648 - Questioner: Okay, our Shaykh, the opening of the Lord which Allah opened upon you — we ask Allah to increase you in these openings.
The Shaykh: Āmīn.
Questioner: Does this apply to the woman who gives birth on the day after her leaving ʿArafah and Muzdalifah and Mina and she wants to perform Ṭawāf al-Ifāḍah and could not and she has forty days remaining and the one she is married to wants to travel?
The Shaykh: No — we have answered this repeatedly and often. Welcome. Why did you not complete your salaam? Why did you not complete what you said? … This matter is treated, my brother. We said, if she becomes ill, what to do with her we said as an answer: "(the religion of Allah is more deserving that it be completed)".
Another questioner: Shaykh, in practical application childbirth is rare but many women experience childbirth frequently.
The Shaykh: My brother, if it happens to women it happens likewise to men; what difference? Women are counterparts of men and the origin is men and women attach to them; they are not equal in some aspects. Welcome, how are you all, good evening, may you be well, God willing; welcome.
Abū Lailā: He wants to ask about … go ahead.

P5649 - Questioner: May Allah bless you. If he intended to perform tayammum and then water came while he was praying — I mean he finished his prayer from tayammum and then water came — does he continue or …
The Shaykh: No. It invalidates the prayer.
Questioner: It invalidates the prayer; may Allah reward you with good.
The Shaykh: (If you find water, take it with your body.)
al-Ḥalabī: Our Shaykh, I recall an important matter at the house of Abū ʿĀsim thirteen years ago, our Shaykh.
The Shaykh: Ma shāʾ Allāh.
al-Ḥalabī: I discussed with our brother Muḥammad Mūsá who was the imam of al-Ashrafiyya and it was a very long discussion and I thought it was the ʿĪd of ʿAbbāsī — we ask Allah to relieve his distress.
The Shaykh: Āmīn.
al-Ḥalabī: And it was, our Shaykh, as if the two positions — to complete or to break — were close to each other, our Shaykh.
The Shaykh: Indeed.
al-Ḥalabī: Yes, the research became long, subḥānallāh, that day.
The Shaykh: A matter of ijtihād, not text.
al-Ḥalabī: Subḥānallāh.
Another questioner: …
The Shaykh: How?
Another questioner: …
The Shaykh: No, it was not; okay, it will be half the night … Algerians then, may Allah reward you.
Questioner: And we ask Allah to reward the Shaykh with the best reward and to benefit everyone with what they heard. To the next tape, brothers, the material of this tape has ended and since there remains space on the tape we are pleased to continue it with this material.

P5650 - Reading from Kitāb al-Wābil al-Ṣa'ib with comments by Shaykh Ibn Bāz, may Allah have mercy on him.
Questioner: This is another brief, concise word in refutation and criticism of that methodology — the methodology of balances — and it is by the learned venerable Shaykh Ibn Bāz when he was asked about the innovator: when do you not mention his good qualities? This was in his lesson commenting on Kitāb al-Wābil al-Ṣa'ib on tape five of the first side.

P5651 - Questioner: In the name of Allah, the Merciful, the Compassionate. Praise be to Allah, and prayers and peace upon the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. After that: Indeed Allah has bestowed upon us the blessing of īmān and bestowed upon the ummah scholars who Allah has honored with what He has given them of knowledge to illuminate for people the way to Allah and to the worship of Allah, Exalted is He; they are undoubtedly the inheritors of the prophets. Our coming was motivated and will remain, God willing, seeking the pleasure of Allah first and the pursuit of knowledge which leads to that, God willing. By Allah, it is a pleasant hour that we meet our Shaykh and our scholar and our great teacher Shaykh Muḥammad Nāṣir al-Dīn al-Albānī — on behalf of the people of the quarter first, the Shuwaykah quarter, we offer our most beautiful welcome to our virtuous Shaykh and on behalf of the people of al-Maṣraq and especially the students of knowledge therein who also all welcome him and they were eager to meet today with our generous teacher; and no harm — we are all eager to hear what he has of pearls of knowledge and wisdom, God willing. So let us listen to what Allah has granted him of knowledge; and when he finishes, the door for questions will be opened so that questions be written and the slips will be available, God willing. A pleasant hour — I repeat — and welcome to our generous Shaykh.
The Shaykh: Welcome to you. Indeed praise be to Allah; we praise Him, seek His help and forgiveness, and we seek refuge with Allah from the evils of our souls and the badness of our deeds. Whomsoever Allah guides, none can misguide, and whomsoever He leaves astray none can guide. I bear witness that there is no god but Allah alone without partner, and I bear witness that Muḥammad is His servant and Messenger ﷺ. As for what follows: The best of speech is the speech of Allah and the best guidance is the guidance of Muḥammad ﷺ and the worst matters are newly-invented matters and every innovation is a bidʿah (innovation) and every bidʿah is a ghalālah (misguidance) and every misguidance is in the Fire. I thank the brother Ibrāhīm for his words and his praise and I have nothing to say in response to that except to emulate the first caliph Abū Bakr al-Ṣiddīq, may Allah be pleased with him, who was the true and first caliph to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and yet when he heard someone praise him he used to say — and I think whoever praises him may exagerate — "O Allah, do not hold me accountable for what they say, and make me better than what they suppose of me, and forgive me for what they do not know." This is said by al-Ṣiddīq the greater; what then shall we say after him?

P5651a - So I say, emulating him: "O Allah, do not take me to task for what they say and make me better than what they suppose and forgive me for what they do not know." Truthfully I say: I am not that described person whom you heard earlier from our brother the virtuous Ibrāhīm. I am merely a student of knowledge, nothing else; and every student must adhere to the Prophet’s ﷺ statement: "Convey from me even an āyah (verse)" and "Tell of the Children of Israel without blame" and "Whoever lies upon me deliberately, let him prepare his seat in the Fire." In accordance with this and in response to these noble Prophetic texts and the other successive texts in the Book of Allah and the ḥadīth of the Messenger ﷺ, we exert effort to convey to people what they may not know. But this does not mean that we have become what our brothers expect of us; it is not like that. The reality in my own feeling from the resolutions of my soul is that when I hear such words I remember the old proverb known among men of letters: "the kite in our land is called a vulture" — the small worthless bird becomes, in people's ignorance of the vulture’s strength and enormity, regarded as an eagle; this proverb applies to many who claim truth and rightness or error and falsehood with respect to Islām, but Allah knows the earth of Islām has become vacant except for very few individuals about whom it may be said of them such-and-such are scholars, as in the authentic ḥadīth which Imam al-Bukhārī collected in his Ṣaḥīḥ from ʿAbd Allāh ʿAmr b. al-ʿĀṣ, may Allah be pleased with him, who said that the Messenger ﷺ said: "Allah does not take away knowledge by snatching it from the hearts of the people; rather He takes away knowledge by causing the scholars to die until when there is no scholar left people will take as their leaders ignorant people who will be asked and will give fatwā without knowledge and thus they will lead astray and be led astray." If Allah intends to remove knowledge He does not do so by making the scholars ignorant as if they never learned; that is not the way of Allah, especially regarding His righteous servants. Rather the way is that He removes knowledge by taking the scholars so that there remain few. As you heard just now a brief word from brother Ibrāhīm — may Allah bless him — that this gathering was indeed for seeking knowledge. Allah, Exalted is He, is just and does not truly take away knowledge from the chests of scholars; yet the way of Allah in His creation is that He takes away knowledge by taking the scholars, as He did with the chiefs of scholars, the prophets and messengers, e.g., Muḥammad ﷺ.

P5651b - "Until when there remains no scholar people will take as their leaders ignorant people who will be asked and will give fatwā without knowledge and thus they will lead astray and be led astray." This does not mean that Allah vacates the earth of a scholar who would be the proof of Allah upon His servants. Rather it means that as time advances knowledge decreases and diminishes more and more until there remains on earth not many who say "Allāh, Allāh." You hear this ḥadīth repeatedly: it is a ḥadīth that says "(The Hour will not come until there are on earth those who say Allāh, Allāh)..." and many of the examples of those indicated in the end of the mentioned ḥadīth — Allah took away knowledge by the taking away of the scholars until no scholar remained so people took as leaders ignorant heads; among these heads are those who interpret the Qurʾān and the Sunnah with exegeses contrary to the way of the scholars — not only the Salaf but also the later ones — for they rely on this ḥadīth "Allāh, Allāh" to permit or even recommend the repetition of the Divine Name in isolation "Allāh, Allāh" so that one not be deceived or ignorant when hearing this ḥadīth with such an interpretation. It occurred to me, by chance, to remind our present brothers that this interpretation is false first because another narration of the Prophet ﷺ explains it, and second because if that interpretation were true the righteous Salaf would have practiced it; their not doing so indicates their rejection of that interpretation. How much more then you who join this other narration — and that is the crux: Imam Aḥmad, may Allah have mercy on him, narrated this ḥadīth in his Musnad with an authentic chain in the wording "(The Hour will not come and on the earth there will be those who say lā ilāha illā Allāh)" — so this is the meaning of the repeated Divine Name in the former narration.

P5651c - The point: today, regrettably, the earth has been vacated of the scholars who filled the wide open earth with their knowledge and spread it among the ranks of their ummah; today they have become, as it was said, "they were if counted few, and today they are fewer than the few." We hope from Allah that He make us among the students of knowledge who truly take the path of the scholars and follow their way sincerely. This we ask of Allah that He make us among those students who walk that path which the Messenger ﷺ said of it: "Whoever follows a path seeking knowledge Allah will make easy for him a path to Paradise." This opens for me the door to speak about this knowledge which is mentioned many times in the Qurʾān, such as His saying "Are those who know and those who do not know equal?" and "Allah will raise those of you who have believed and those who were given knowledge in degrees." What is this knowledge that Allah praised its possessors and those who are immersed in it and those who follow their path? As Ibn al-Qayyim al-Jawziyya, may Allah have mercy on him, the pupil of Shaykh al-Islām Ibn Taymiyyah, said: "Knowledge: Allah said; His Messenger said; the Companions said; it is not sophistry…" (poem). If we take from this line and from this verse and from this rare poetry — for the poetry of the scholars is unlike that of ordinary poets — this man is a scholar who composes good poetry — he says: "Knowledge: Allah said in the first rank; the Messenger said in the second; the Companions in the third" — here I will make my word in this blessed evening, God willing, the word of Ibn al-Qayyim which reminds us of a very important reality long neglected by the majority of daʿwah workers today calling to Islām. What is this reality?

P5651d - It is well-known among these daʿwah workers that Islām is the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of the Messenger ﷺ — this is true without doubt — yet it is incomplete. This incompleteness is what Ibn al-Qayyim pointed to in his verse when after "the Book and the Sunnah" he mentioned the Companions: "knowledge: Allah said; His Messenger said; the Companions said…" Nowadays rarely do we hear anyone mention the Companions along with the Book and the Sunnah, whereas as we all know they are the head of the Salaf al-Ṣāliḥ who transmitted the ḥadīth from the Prophet ﷺ by tawātur; the Prophet said "the best of people are my generation." Do not say, as many of the public preachers say, "the best of generations"…

P5651e - "The best of generations" has no origin in the Sunnah. The correct wording in the Ṣaḥīḥayn and other collections is the narration "(the best of people are my generation, then those who come after them, then those who come after them)". These Companions who are at the head of the three generations known for their excellence — Imam Ibn al-Qayyim included them with the Book and the Sunnah. Was this inclusion of his an opinion or ijtihād liable to error? No; this is not ijtihād nor something that could be mistaken; rather it is reliance on the Book of Allah and on the ḥadīth of the Messenger ﷺ. As for the Book, our Lord said in the Qurʾān: "And whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has been made clear to him and follows other than the way of the believers" — He did not say merely "whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has been made clear to him will turn away" — rather He said "...and follows other than the way of the believers" for a profound wisdom which we are now in the process of clarifying: "and follows other than the way of the believers" — I hope this be fixed in your minds and hearts so it does not leave you — it is the truth as you speak and thus you will be saved from deviating right or left or being, even in one detail, of a misguided faction. The Prophet ﷺ in the well-known ḥadīth (I abbreviate now to the relevant part) said "(My ummah will split into seventy-three sects; all of them are in the Fire except one)" They asked: "Who is it, O Messenger of Allah?" He said: "It is al-Jamaʿah (the community)." al-Jamaʿah is the way of the believers. If the ḥadīth is not direct revelation it is a drawing from the previous verse; "whoever follows other than the way of the believers is promised the Fire." Conversely, whoever follows the way of the believers is promised Paradise. When the Prophet ﷺ answered about the saved sect he said: "It is what I and my Companions are upon." So the Companions are the way of the believers; when Ibn al-Qayyim mentioned the Companions and his companions (al-Ṣaḥābah wa aṣḥābih) he derived that from the previous verse and hadith. Another well-known ḥadīth of al-Arbāḍ b. Sāriyah is also relevant: the Prophet ﷺ said "(Adhere to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the rightly-guided caliphs after me.)" So here, like the previous hadith and verse, the Prophet did not say "adhere only to my Sunnah" but added the Sunnah of the righteous caliphs after him. From this we say — especially in this time when opinions and schools have multiplied and parties and groups have proliferated causing many young Muslims to be perplexed and not know which group to affiliate with — the answer from the verse and the two hadiths cited is: follow the way of the believers — but which believers? Not the present era but the bygone era, the first era of the Companions and the Salaf al-Ṣāliḥ — they should be our model and those we follow, and none other on earth. Here lies the central point: it rests on three pillars — the Book, the Sunnah, and following the Salaf al-Ṣāliḥ. Whoever claims to follow the Book and the Sunnah but does not follow the Salaf al-Ṣāliḥ has not truly relied on the Book and the Sunnah but rather on his reason, or better said, on his desire. From habit I give examples to clarify this principle: there is a saying of al-Farūq ʿUmar b. al-Khattāb, may Allah be pleased with him: "If the people of desires and innovations argue with you from the Qurʾān, argue with them from the Sunnah; the Qurʾān is multivalent" — why did ʿUmar say this? Because Allah said in the Qurʾān "And We sent down the Reminder (al-dhikr) that it may make clear to the people what was sent down to them" — can an Arab Muslim who is, as they say, the Sibawayh of his time in knowledge of the Arabic language and its eloquence understand the Qurʾān except through the path of our Prophet ﷺ? No. Otherwise the verse "that it may make clear to the people what was sent down to them" would be idle, and Allah forbid that there be waste in Allah's Speech. Whoever seeks to understand the Qurʾān apart from the Messenger ﷺ has gone far astray. And can that man understand the Qurʾān and the Sunnah apart from the Messenger ﷺ? Also no, because they transmitted to us first the wording of the Qurʾān revealed on the heart of Muḥammad ﷺ and secondly they transmitted its explanation by the Messenger ﷺ and his practice. Here I must pause briefly — the exposition by the Messenger ﷺ is of three kinds: verbal, practical (action), and tacit approval. Who transmits the verbal? The Companions. The practical? The Companions. The tacit approval? The Companions.

P5651f - Therefore we cannot be independent in understanding the Book and the Sunnah solely by our linguistic faculties. This does not mean that language is unnecessary; indeed we assert emphatically that non-Arabs who did not master Arabic have made many grave errors, particularly when they commit this fundamental mistake of not returning to the Salaf al-Ṣāliḥ in understanding the Book and the Sunnah. I do not mean by my previous words disregard for language — no; to understand the speech of the Companions we must know Arabic, and to understand the Qurʾān and the Sunnah we must know Arabic. But we say that the clarification by the Messenger ﷺ mentioned in the Qurʾān is of three divisions: saying, action, and approval. For example, if we are forced to give examples to grasp that the division is an actual thing with practical impetus: His saying, "As for the male and female thief, cut off their hands" — the word "thief" linguistically may include anyone who steals any money from a secure place whether the amount is trivial — one egg or a small coin — but does that mean the hand is cut for every thief? No. Why? Because the clarifier who explained the clarifier (al-mubayyin) is the Messenger, and he explained who among the thieves the hand is cut for by saying "(No cutting except for theft of a quarter of a dinar and upward)". So whoever stole less than a quarter of a dinar, although called a thief linguistically, is not called a thief legally. From this we reach an important scientific reality many students of knowledge are heedless of: there is a transmitted Arabic language and a legal/technical language (luġa sharʿiyya) — the Arabs of the Qurʾānic language were not previously acquainted with such technical usages. Thus if "thief" is used in the language it includes all thieves, but if the legal "thief" is mentioned it does not include all thieves but only one who stole a quarter dinar or more. This is a practical example showing we cannot be independent in understanding the Book and the Sunnah by our knowledge of Arabic only. This is what many contemporary writers fall into: they apply their knowledge of Arabic to the noble verses and Prophetic ḥadīths and produce innovations in interpretation unknown to former generations. Hence we say one must understand that the mission of true Islām is based on three fundamentals: the Book, the Sunnah, and what the Salaf al-Ṣāliḥ were upon. "The thief" therefore is not to be interpreted by mere language but by the legal language which states "no cutting except for a quarter of a dinar and upward." Then in the completion of the verse "and cut off their hands" — what is the hand in language? It is the whole arm to the armpit; where then is the cut to be applied? From here or from there? The Messenger ﷺ clarified it by his practical action; we do not have a verbal ḥadīth that specifies the place of cutting; rather we have a practical, applied clarification.

P5651j - From our righteous Salaf, the Companions of the Prophet ﷺ, we derive the second category which is the practical clarification; the third is the Prophet’s tacit approval of something he neither said nor did but observed and remained silent — that tacit approval is an indication of permissibility. If he saw something and remained silent and approved it, then what he saw is deemed approved and permissible; if he saw something and disapproved and forbade it, that is different. Here are two examples from strange ḥadīths: ʿAbd Allāh b. ʿUmar, may Allah be pleased with them both, said "(We used to drink while standing and we used to eat while walking in the time of the Prophet ﷺ)" — he spoke of two matters: drinking while standing and eating while walking; these were realities in the time of the Prophet ﷺ. What is the legal ruling regarding these two matters? If we apply our previous framework: one who knows what the Messenger ﷺ did in word, deed, and approval, and returns to the authentic Sunnah — regarding the first matter (drinking while standing) there are many ḥadīths in which the Prophet forbade drinking while standing; I do not want to prolong this matter lest we not keep to our plan of brevity to allow time for questions — and also this issue alone requires a separate session. But suffice to say I will narrate a sound ḥadīth from Muslim from Anas b. Mālik in which he said: "(The Messenger ﷺ forbade drinking while standing.)" In another formula "(the Messenger ﷺ rebuked drinking while standing.)" So that which they used to do in the time of the Prophet ﷺ as testified by the ḥadīth of Ibn ʿUmar was negated by the Prophet’s prohibition and thus what they used to do became abrogated by the Prophet’s prohibition. But the second part — they used to eat while walking — there is no prohibition transmitted, so from his tacit approval we derive a legal ruling. Up to here I suffice to show the necessity of relying on understanding the Book and the Sunnah as the Salaf al-Ṣāliḥ understood them, and not to be independent in interpreting the Book and the Sunnah as one pleases.

P5651k - He said: "(The Messenger ﷺ forbade drinking while standing.)" And in a variant "(He rebuked drinking while standing.)" Thus that which they used to do in the presence of the Prophet ﷺ as reported by Ibn ʿUmar was nullified by the Prophet’s prohibition. But the second part — that they ate while walking — we have no report of the Prophet forbidding it; thus from its being observed and not forbidden we derive permissibility. To this point I stop in order to indicate the necessity of relying on the understanding of the Book and the Sunnah as the Salaf al-Ṣāliḥ were upon, and not to be independent in understanding the Book and the Sunnah as one pleases. Now having made clear the importance of this restriction upon the methodology of the Salaf al-Ṣāliḥ, let me bring some old examples: in the past Muslims split into many sects — you have heard of the Muʿtazilah, the Murjiʾah, the Khawārij, the Zaydiyya, not to mention the Shīʿah and the Rāfiḍah — and so on; these sects, however deviant, do not deny that they rely on the Book and the Sunnah; none of them says "we do not adopt the Book and the Sunnah" — otherwise he would be outside Islām entirely. Then why the split if they all rely on the Book and the Sunnah? I testify that they rely on the Book and the Sunnah, but their reliance was without adhering to the third source, the way of the Salaf al-Ṣāliḥ. Also note another point: the Sunnah differs entirely from the Qurʾān in that the Qurʾān is preserved between the two covers of the muṣḥaf, as is known; the Sunnah, however, is first distributed among hundreds, nay thousands, of books, much of which remains in the realm of manuscripts; even among the printed works there are authentic and weak ḥadīths. Those who rely on the Sunnah — whether belonging to Ahl al-Sunnah wa al-Jamaʿah upon the way of the Salaf or belonging to other sects — many of them do not distinguish between authentic and weak ḥadīths and thus fall into error and contradict the Book and the Sunnah because they relied upon weak or fabricated ḥadīths.

P5651l - The point: some of the aforementioned sects denied some Qurʾānic truths and Prophetic ḥadīths in the past and also in recent times. The Qurʾān confirms and gives glad tidings to the believers of a great blessing they shall enjoy when they meet Allah — that the Lord of the Worlds will manifest Himself to them and they will see Him, as stated in texts from the Qurʾān and dozens of Prophetic ḥadīths. Some old and new sects denied this blessing. The old Muʿtazilah — today I am not aware of someone openly declaring he is Muʿtazilī — yet I saw a foolish man declare himself a Muʿtazilī and deny many clear sharʿī truths because he was carried away by his head. The Muʿtazilah denied this vision and said it is impossible for a created servant to see Allah manifestly; what did they do? Did they deny the Qurʾān? If they denied this verse they would be disbelievers and apostates but they did not deny the textual Qurʾān; rather they denied its meaning as explained by the Sunnah. They affirmed the verse verbally but denied the meaning. Words are vessels of meanings; if we affirm the words but deny the true meanings, that affirmation profits nothing. Their minds were narrow and could not conceive that a created servant could see Allah manifestly; thus they tampered with the Qurʾānic text by allegorizing it to fit their feeble reason. "Whoever believes in the unseen" — the unseen is Allah and matters beyond perception; their faith in the unseen was weak and their faith in their own reason stronger than their faith in the unseen commanded in the opening of Sūrah al-Baqarah: "Alif Lām Mīm. This is the Book about which there is no doubt, a guidance for the righteous" — who are "those who believe in the unseen"? So the Muʿtazilah did not admit this reality and thus denied many Prophetic ḥadīths explaining the Qurʾān.

P5651m - Likewise the other verse which may be less apparent to some is His saying: "For those who do good is the best (al-ḥusnā) and a further bounty" — "those who do good" meaning the people of Paradise and "the further bounty" meaning the vision of Allah for those who do good; this is established in a ḥadīth in Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim with its authentic chain from Saʿd b. Abī Waqqāṣ — the Prophet ﷺ said "(For those who do good is Paradise and a further bounty — the vision of Allah.)" The Muʿtazilah and likewise the Shīʿah (who are Muʿtazilī in creed) denied the vision of Allah stipulated in the first verse and clarified by the Prophet in the latter verse with numerous authentic Prophetic narrations. Their allegorical reinterpretation of the Qurʾān caused them to deny authentic Sunnah and thus moved them out of being among the saved sect ("what I and my Companions are upon"). The Messenger ﷺ was upon belief that the believers will see their Lord, for this is in Ṣaḥīḥayn and other collections in hadiths from a group of Companions such as Abū Saʿīd al-Khudrī, Anas b. Mālik, the narration outside Ṣaḥīḥayn from Abū Bakr al-Ṣiddīq and others in which he ﷺ said "(You shall see your Lord on the Day of Resurrection as you see the full moon; you will not be confused in seeing Him)" — two narrations, "lā tuḍāmmūn" whether with tanqīṣ or tashdīd; meaning you will not doubt in His vision as you do not doubt in the sighting of the full moon. They denied these ḥadīths by their reason.

P5651n - Similarly the Qādiyāniyyah (Ahmadiyya) you may have heard of — they say like us "I testify there is no god but Allah and I testify that Muḥammad is the Messenger of Allah," they perform the five prayers, attend Friday, perform Ḥajj and ʿUmrah — outwardly no difference between us and them — yet they differ from us in many creed matters; for example they claim that prophethood did not close and that prophets will come after Muḥammad ﷺ; they claim that a prophet came in Qadian in India and whoever does not believe in that prophet according to them is a disbeliever. How can they say that in the face of the explicit verse "(Muhammad is not the father of any man among you; he is the Messenger of Allah and the seal of the prophets)"? And the many mutawātir ḥadīths stating there will be no prophet after me. They interpret the verse and ḥadīths not as the Salaf did; they allegorize "khatam al-nubuwwīn" to mean "ornament of the prophets" (khatam as ornament) — they did not disbelieve in the verse textually but they denied its real intended meaning. What does it profit to believe in words without believing in the realities of meanings? This is a definite reality. What is the way to reach the truths of meanings of the Book and the Sunnah? You have been shown the way: not to interpret by our own linguistic knowledge and literature, or habits, or schools, or methods, but as has been said, "all good is in following those who went before and all evil in innovating after them." I end this with a reminder for whoever has a heart or gives ear.

P5651o - I must after concluding my talk remind you of some matters contrary to the Sunnah and even contrary to the Prophetic command. Some people enter the mosque at such a time and sit in the mosque like a hen sitting over her chicks — they do not perform two rakʿāt (the two rakʿahs) for greeting the mosque; I know he thinks that because it is a disliked time prayers of greeting the mosque are not legislated then. The rule "every rule has exceptions" applies: indeed there are times disliked for prayer but earlier scholars differed about these times: do they include every prayer even if it is obligatory? For example a man put his head down after he prayed ẓuhr and did not wake until the time of dislike — does he perform that prayer as the ʿAṣr prayer or not? The unanimous answer is yes. So the prohibition of praying in disliked times is not absolute; it has specifications. There is a good book I advise students who desire to know the causes of the disagreement then follow from that knowledge the right view: it is by Shams al-Ḥaqq al-Ābādī titled "Iʿlām Ahl al-ʿAṣr bi-Aḥkām Rakʿatayni Sunnat al-Fajr" — here he mentioned many texts from the authentic Sunnah that specify times where the prohibition of prayer does not apply, including our present matter: one who enters the mosque in a time when prayer is not legislated — yes, prayer is not legislated then except the greeting of the mosque — why? Because of a general text: the Prophet ﷺ said "(When one of you enters the mosque let him not sit until he prays two rakʿahs)" and another text even stronger in implication: you know that the Prophet ﷺ used to deliver the Friday khutbah; on one occasion a man from the Ghatafān entered and sat and the Messenger ﷺ cut his khutbah short to him and said "(O so-and-so, did you pray?)" He said "No." He said "(Stand and pray two rakʿahs.)" Then he addressed the audience: "(When one of you comes to Friday and the imam is delivering the khutbah let him pray two rakʿahs and shorten them and keep the recitation brief.)" The import of this hadith cannot be known except by a short preliminary remark: you know that commanding with good and forbidding evil is originally obligatory; if the khātib (preacher) is delivering the khutbah even if with one word, and you see someone speaking, is it permitted to say to him "Be silent" — no; the obligation of commanding the good which ordinarily applies is suspended while the khātib speaks because the khātib is performing an obligation. If you find that the Prophet ﷺ addressed the Companions generally: "(When one of you comes to Friday and the imam is delivering the khutbah let him pray two rakʿahs)" this means that that time which is originally not permissible for the obligatory command of enjoining good — hence not permissible for mere supererogatory prayer — is excepted for the two rakʿahs of greeting the mosque. Therefore greeting the mosque is to be prayed at a time that is otherwise disliked for nafl in general. This establishes that nafl that have causes (adhwāt al-asbāb) differ from absolute nafl; absolute nafls are what is meant by the prohibition during disliked times (the three times and the two and the combined five) while nafls with causes such as greeting the mosque or the sunnah of wuḍūʾ are legislated in disliked times. This is the gist of the matter and the most important of them is greeting the mosque because the Messenger ﷺ ordered it while he was delivering the khutbah and did not permit sitting before performing it. How then can one enter the mosque and sit claiming it is a disliked time? He should know the disliked time is specific to absolute nafl, whereas nafls with causes are not only not disliked but are legislated. This is the summary in this important issue. There are other matters; if you have questions now we are ready to hear them and answer what we can.
