P5427e - It is the sharʿ (religious law); then we shall say, “O my brother, if you claim that this incident is a good sunnah (recommended), the ‘good’ is known only by the legal text, so we say: bring your proof if you are truthful, and they will not at all find evidence for approving a bidʿah (innovation) that has no root in the Sunnah.” After this remark, to make clear that this ḥadīth (report) cannot be adduced for that which contradicts the preceding rule — “Every bidʿah (innovation) is misguidance and every misguidance is in the Fire” — what is meant by the ḥadīth, as I stated above, is an exhortation to Muslims to revive acts of worship and sunan (traditions) whether they are recommended or whether they are emphasized, let alone if they are among the farāʾiḍ (obligatory duties.); in this ḥadīth there is a strong urging to revive what people have neglected and abandoned because of reasons previously mentioned and others; why? — so that he receives its reward and the reward of whoever follows him in this revival until the Day of Resurrection.

P5427e - I mentioned the other ḥadīth and, as I said, to kill two birds with one stone: first, that it is explicit in explaining the meaning of this ṣaḥīḥ (authentic) ḥadīth — “Whoever revives a sunnah that was dead after me, for him is its reward” — and second, to remind you that if you see such a ḥadīth in some books you will of course see it because it is in one of the Six (canonical) books, specifically Sunan al-Tirmidhī. This ḥadīth was narrated by al-Tirmidhī but in its isnād (chain of narration) there is a man named Kathīr b. ʿAbd Allāh b. ʿUmar b. ʿAwf al-Muznī who is a man accused of lying, so he related the ḥadīth perhaps by meaning inspired by the authentic ḥadīth and said: “Whoever revives a sunnah that was made dead after me…” But this explicit meaning here in this ḍaʿīf (weak) ḥadīth has appeared in the ṣaḥīḥ (authentic) ḥadīth which suffices us, and this is one of our arguments against this interpretation or against this newly-invented division of the sunnah — a familiar sunnah and an unfamiliar sunnah — I hear of this division for the first time; do you have knowledge of this division?
Questioner: New knowledge.
The Shaykh: Allāhu akbar — the ḥadīth to which I now refer says the Messenger ﷺ: “Indeed al-Islām began as strange and will return to being strange, so glad tidings to the strangers.” They said, “O Messenger of Allah, who are they?” He said, “They are those who revive what people have corrupted or who rectify what people have corrupted of my sunnah after me.” Thus in this ḥadīth there is an exhortation to Muslims to be among the strangers, and among the attributes of these strangers is that they rectify what people have corrupted of the Prophet’s ﷺ sunnah.
Questioner: This statement reminded me — I have heard it from some of them but in another wording, which is —
The Shaykh: Which is?
Questioner: “A well-known bidʿah (innovation) is better than an unknown sunnah (recommended).”
The Shaykh: Yes, that is correct.
Questioner: Yes.
The Shaykh: Unfortunately, if they have predecessors —
Questioner: Yes.

P5427f - The Shaykh: But it has followers thereafter.
Questioner: Yes, I remembered now.
The Shaykh: “A familiar sunnah and an unfamiliar sunnah” — thus the Messenger ﷺ, while he exhorts Muslims in the first authentic ḥadīth to revive the sunnah so that its reward and the reward of whoever acts by it are recorded for them, likewise here he exhorts the Muslims in general to be among the strangers, and among the attributes of those strangers is that they rectify what people have corrupted of my sunnah after me. Thus ends my answer, insofar as occurs to me now, regarding that division which has no basis — yet yes.
Questioner: The answer ends here.
The Shaykh: But what do you mean by “my speech has ended”?
Questioner: Yes.
The Shaykh: There is no doubt that if one departs from the revealed rules and takes up this invented division, the matter will surely continue downward to degradation and collapse until the sunnan themselves die and the bidʿahs (innovations) live and take their place; and there is not a single scholar in the world, even if he is of the later generations, who could say such a thing — this division of the sunnah into these two categories. This invented division contradicts the explicit principles that exhort all Muslims and that exhort the strangers who are given glad tidings — glad tidings, as he ﷺ said in the authentic ḥadīth: “A tree in Paradise under whose shade a rider hastening would travel for a hundred years without crossing it” — this tree is for those strangers. What is the attribute of these strangers? “They rectify what people have corrupted of my sunnah after me.” Thus this division is not only an innovation contrary to the general statement of his ﷺ: “Every bidʿah (innovation) is misguidance and every misguidance is in the Fire,” but this division is an innovation opposing the sayings of Muslim scholars when they said: every bidʿah that contradicts the sunnah is a bidʿah of misguidance, although they permit calling something a “good bidʿah” on condition that it does not contradict a sunnah. How then, having contradicted many sunnan, do they do this? If one were to pursue the texts one would find many many things. And here my speech ends in reply to that question.
Questioner: There remains a fatwā at the end of the question that appeared from you.
The Shaykh: Go ahead.
Questioner: It is the consideration of maṣlaḥah and mafsadah — and what is the rule (miqyas) for consideration?

P5427g - The Shaykh: There is no doubt that this rule as a scientific principle — there is absolutely no doubt as to its validity: to repel harm before bringing benefit. “Repelling harm before bringing benefit” is a rule with no doubt in it; but I observe among some contemporaries today who make this rule their crutch and pillar in urging people not to attend to the forgotten, neglected, abandoned sunnan under the pretext of repelling harm: how strange it is that they advise the masses and say to them, “O people, if you hear from some people a sunnah and a ḥadīth about it supporting this sunnah, whether it is from his ﷺ word or his action, beware that none of you hastens to denounce those who come with this sunnah, because ‘they will have its reward and the reward of whoever acted by it’” — instead of directing this admonition to those who corrupt on the earth and corrupt the sunnah and do not reform, these are more deserving to be addressed with this advice than the supporters and followers of the sunnah and revivers of the sunnah.

P5427h - As for the gauge for applying this accepted rule, it is, for example: if it were to follow from acting by a sunnah — now we say truly that there are people among us who have absolutely no knowledge of the sunnah, absolutely no knowledge of the sunnah, and if the revival of this sunnah were to come abruptly and all at once, suddenly and in one leap — as they say in our Levant: “al-lawwīyah” — and from it would ensue the shedding of blood, there is no doubt that this is a mafsadah (harm) that does not equal the maṣlaḥah (benefit) of acting by this sunnah; because this sunnah requires preparation and gradual paving, slowly slowly, so that before anything people hear that there is such a sunnah. For example, take the raising of the hands at the rukuʿ and the lowering from it: in many non-Arab lands, such as among the Turks, Albanians and Yugoslavs, they know raising the hands only at the takbīrat al-iḥrām; so if a man suddenly raised his hands at rukuʿ there will surely occur a mufsadah (harm), but he must prepare for reviving this sunnah by reviving the knowledge of the sunnah, reminding them of the ḥadīths that enjoin adherence to the sunnah and the warnings against bidʿah (innovation), and the reports transmitted from the pious salaf, and he should persist in that for days until he sees that the people have been prepared to accept a sunnah from among the abandoned, neglected sunnan — this is approximately the gauge. The evidence for that is that when the Prophet ﷺ entered Mecca as a victorious conqueror, he entered and prayed two rakʿahs inside the Kaʿbah, giving thanks to Allah the Exalted for that great conquest, and when he went out his wife ʿĀʾishah, may Allah be pleased with her, wished to emulate her Prophet ﷺ and to pray two rakʿahs in the interior of the Kaʿbah. And as you know, unfortunately to this day the door to the Kaʿbah is in the state it was in the Age of Ignorance — raised so that one cannot enter the interior of the Kaʿbah except by ladder, and this ladder, regrettably, is not placed except, I will not say for private persons, perhaps it is proper to say for some of the greatest criminals among them.
Questioner: For some of the greatest criminals among them.
The Shaykh: For some of the greatest criminals among them — such was the situation in the time of the Messenger ﷺ — so he said to her, to make it easy for her in emulating the Prophet ﷺ: “Pray in the Ḥajar.” You all know the Ḥajar al-Masūr with its arch in the wall; it is part of the Kaʿbah. “Were it not that your people are of recent habit in shirk I would have demolished the Kaʿbah and rebuilt it upon the foundation of Abraham, and I would have made for it two doors at ground level” — at ground level, not a ladder, so that one enters by one door and exits by the other — “this is what is built upon ease.” What did the Prophet ﷺ do?
