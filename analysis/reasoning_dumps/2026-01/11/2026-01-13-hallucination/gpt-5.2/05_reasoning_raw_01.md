Translating and rendering prophet names and salutations
The transliteration of names like "ʿĪsā" should follow the ALA-LC format, while "Allah" remains in the glossary. For salutations, the phrase "عليه الصلاة والسلام" can be used but not translated too literally unless specifically rendered in English. And, of course, no Arabic script should appear except for specific salutations like ﷺ.

Rendering salutations and transliterations
For salutations like "عليه الصلاة والسلام," it’s common to render as "peace be upon him" in English, but this isn't explicitly required unless it's for Prophet Muḥammad. Since the rule says "No Arabic script except ﷺ," I’ll stick to full ALA-LC transliteration for names like "ʿĪsā". Parentheses are only for dates or definitions.

Translating salutations and applying transliteration rules
For "صلى الله عليه وسلم," it should only be rendered as ﷺ when referring to Prophet Muhammad. For other prophets, translating it to "peace be upon him" is likely appropriate. I'll stick to the transliteration rules for names, like "Ibn Taymiyyah" and "Muḥammad Nāṣir ad-Dīn al-Albānī," following ALA-LC guidelines.

Applying ALA-LC transliteration for names and terms
For names like "Muḥammad Nāṣir ad-Dīn al-Albānī", I'll use "al-Albānī" with lowercase "al-" mid-sentence. Titles like "Shaykh" will stay capitalized, as per the glossary. "Abū Mālik" will also follow the ALA-LC system, and technical terms like "Islām" will be defined on first occurrence.

Translating and defining technical terms in the text
When terms like "Qurʾān" appear for the first time, I’ll transliterate it as "Qurʾān (Book Name)" per the glossary. I’ll also define terms like "dīn (religion)" and "Rasulullah" as "Messenger of Allah" at their first occurrence. For labels like "الشيخ," "السائل," I'll follow the label mapping rules too.

Formatting Q&A and defining technical terms
For Q&A, I'll start a new line for each speaker, keeping their label and text on the same line. If multiple speakers are involved, I’ll display the segment ID once at the start, with subsequent speakers on new lines. I'll need to define technical terms like "Sunnah," "Islām," "dīn," and "Qurʾān" on their first occurrence.

Translating content while following rules
In translating the content, I’ll adhere to the rules provided, making sure to transliterate the words like "ʿĪsā" and use appropriate salutations like “peace be upon him” for the translation. I’ll also follow the rule for book titles, ensuring titles are transliterated, like "al-Jawāb al-Ṣaḥīḥ li-man baddala dīn al-Masīḥ." For certain names, like "Ibn Taymiyyah," the glossary guides me toward the correct transliteration.

Translating segment by segment accurately
I will define key terms like "Islām (Islam)" and "dīn (religion)" upon their first occurrence in the text, such as in P5511. The translation will be faithful, making sure "Sunnah (The Corpus/Prophetic Tradition)" and "Qurʾān (Book Name)" are defined properly. Each speaker’s name will follow the correct Q&A format, such as "The Shaykh," and avoid repeating the segment ID.

Translating phrases while following rules
I must retain the meaning of phrases while adhering to the guidelines. "Sharʿ" translates to "Islamic law", but I don't need to add parentheses since it's not a technical term from the glossary. Names like “Abū Mālik” remain transliterated without additional translation. I’ll apply the respectful abbreviation for Prophet Muhammad ﷺ and preserve the sentence structure while sticking to fluency and clarity in translation.

Refining translation details
For phrases like "وين هذا!" I'll make sure to translate it as "Where is that now!" in a more colloquial tone. As for "روح وتعال وإلى آخره" — I'll render it accurately but concisely, as "Go and come and so on…" For Qurʾān quotes, I'll stick with the definition rules and not include citations. For names, I'll follow the transliteration guidelines, taking care with diacritics. For "البناني" and "Tuwān/Tawān", I'll stick with the most proper transliteration per the instructions.
