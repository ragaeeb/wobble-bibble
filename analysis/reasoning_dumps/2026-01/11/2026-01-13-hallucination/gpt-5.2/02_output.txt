P5511 - The Shaykh: Look, our brother Saʿd, the difference between sharʿ (Islamic law) and the reality of those clinging today to Islām (Islam), which we indicated earlier, is that it is your duty to learn the correct Islām (Islam). A man from the polytheists came to the Prophet ﷺ and said to him, "Convert me." He said, "I find myself reluctant." He said, "Convert even though you are reluctant." Where is that! He comes to convert — go and come and so on — and praise be to Allah the acceptance was completed…
Abū Mālik: Our Lord’s not accepting that he knows this is not a Muslim… astonishing.
The Shaykh: Allāhu akbar. This is ignorance about Islām (Islam).
Questioner: Brother, there is a matter — just now you preferred to advise your parents… The situation I want to describe now is, of course, not a criticism of anyone at all, but I was surprised: we are in an Islām (Islamic) country and at every door I knocked, despite the persecutions I am exposed to and despite the seizure of my possessions — my car and my shop were seized — and I was thrown about, and Shaykh Yūnus knows, from hotel to hotel; by Allah, my situation — I did not find, of course, an authority concerned to stand by me; on the contrary the whole talk circled around one thing, that is… We are in the era of the nineties and a time of such-and-such — that is, what forced you to do this while you did not need it…
The Shaykh: I seek refuge in Allah.
Questioner: We can say there is no Islām (Islam) — of course one cannot be certain in such matters — but I reached the minister of awqāf, I went to the chief judge, I reviewed more than one source for my situation, I stood at the prime minister’s door and waited for him when he came out; I sat and told him why they are fighting me, why this is happening to me; I earlier sent a doctor at the University of Jordan to the president of the Chamber of Notables and the Chamber of Deputies — alas — of course one feels as if one has committed a crime…
The Shaykh: Allāhu akbar.
Questioner: That is what I find.
The Shaykh: Brother, may we know whose seizure you referred to?
Questioner: I was deprived of family and of everything, of course; I have nothing. If you want to go back and take what you want, go to the priest, let him sprinkle on your head and return to your religion — such words.
The Shaykh: Well, excuse me — is the car registered in your name?
Questioner: Our inheritance was like a room where everything is placed, and if you need, withdraw…
The Shaykh: So you have nothing in your name?
Questioner: No.
Another questioner: In inheritance the Islām (Islamic) inheritance law does not give you because there is no inheritance between you and your parents…
The Shaykh: There is no inheritance now…
Another questioner: after he converted …

P5511a - Questioner: I am not greedy for inheritance nor greedy for anything; the matter… I graduated university in business administration and moreover I speak Italian, Greek, English and Arabic — four languages — so when I approached the Muslims’ door in the country where I expected to find a certain position for me, a job to work at, a shelter, a certain situation — unfortunately regarding everything I mentioned — rather they told me go back to so-and-so, go to so-and-so; the matter was like that; I even heard from someone — I will not mention names — that there is no special provision for people like you, you are a special case…
Another questioner: Yes, of course…
The Shaykh: No, not "of course" — may Allah guide you…
Another questioner: The reality is that they do not think about calling people to Islām (Islam); they have relieved themselves of that, and evidence for this is the statement of the chief judge that the priest comes… that it has become a crime for a man of the People of the Book to believe among the community of Muslims and they consider themselves as aggressors in this and that they have approached, you might say, the People of the Book in this, and that stirs up hatred and rancor because they have abandoned the duty of inviting to Islām (Islam), and Allah will ask them about that, blessed and exalted is He…
Questioner: But there is something here — there is something well-known. The situation similar to mine — certainly any person, especially if his family needs him, will be exposed to persecutions and provocations and troubles; there must be an authority to protect him, an authority to help him…
Abū Mālik: I will tell you something: your situation is very special. Look, you are from one of the notable families in the country that has standing and prestige, so when someone from the Jābir family or from the Ṭawān family or from the Ḥaddādīn family converts, it is not like when an unknown obscure person converts. This shakes a family from two sides: firstly socially and secondly religiously. Socially, because of prominence — meaning there is no care for your parents and your children and your daughters — those are unprotected. Religiously, because this has prominence and reputation; that a person believes from the Jābir household is a terribly scandalous reputation for…
The Shaykh: It causes an earthquake…
Abū Mālik: It causes an earthquake. And I, our shaykh, have a previous experience with someone from the Ṭawān house: a young man from the Ṭawān house converted in Abū Dhabi and came from there sick and miserable; he converted to a good Islām (Islam), that is his Islām became sound for ten or twelve years now; this is like the brother’s case…
Another questioner: He also has a brother who converted and returned to Christianity…

P5511b - Questioner: Not a brother — a cousin… I heard that a Karāk woman about two months ago was killed… there is no authority, no Islām (Islamic) country that can protect us. I studied and graduated from the theological seminary of the church in Bethlehem and was supposed to become a priest after my study of the four Gospels… I began to attend the faculty of sharīʿah and developed other convictions regarding the Qurʾān (Book Name) and dīn (religion). A person by conviction — not for show or for gain — but why does a person, when he comes to take such a step…
Abū Mālik: On the contrary you… you lose…
Questioner: Excuse me, I am not speaking of material things…
Abū Mālik: … if you measure by material criteria, allow me to say I would not claim you are measuring by material criteria; I say to you if you measured by material criteria you would appear to be a loser. Like this one from the Ṭawān household — do you not know Sulaymān? You do not know him. I have known him for five or six years; the last time his family put a knife to his neck and shot at him — of course they nearly killed him — but they put a knife to his neck in order for what? He had promissory notes signed for loans, and these checks, of course, they took to court when they learned of his conversion and wanted to imprison him. I spoke with the judge and asked him to postpone the matter until we gathered the amount for him — the amount was one thousand eight hundred dinars and he was also poor and distressed — true words; indeed he has heavy shadows of tragedies befalling him when one converts and finds no protector and no place to shelter him; he truly has…

P5511c - Questioner: Brother here… guide your family: if I had embraced Islām (Islam) or turned to Islām (Islam) by myself and did not find a Muslim to remind me, should I go and guide my family?…
Abū Mālik: I want to tell you something: first, as that brother told you, there is no place for people like you among the Muslims — firstly that is a coarse and severe and impolite word, indeed ill-mannered to say such a thing. By Allah, brother, look at people like us, the weak; by Allah our chests are open to you and our backs are for you and we will stand with you, God willing, to the utmost of our ability; we will not fall short in what we can do, and you will find among your brothers, God willing, people like us, the weak, who will stand by you sincerely and loyally without seeking reward or thanks. Perhaps you have felt in this session — maybe this is your first time sitting in such a session with students among them and with them and at their head a shaykh from the great scholars of Islām (Islam) whom Allah granted us in this time, Shaykh Muḥammad Nāṣir ad-Dīn al-Albānī.
The Shaykh: Excuse me.

P5511d - Abū Mālik: I consider it a grace for you that you came to this mosque with Shaykh Yūnus — may Allah reward him well — and you met these brothers in this house; we consider them your brothers and what we have we will share with you, God willing, and we will not withhold from you and you will find from us what pleases you; but if you find what displeases you from others then, I mean, do not take it to heart…
The Shaykh: "No soul shall bear the burden of another"!
Abū Mālik: "No soul shall bear the burden of another" — that is it…
The Shaykh: I have a word incidentally: the word has two halves; one half relates to what you have seen of the lack of cooperation from the society in which you live as a Muslim society, and the second half relates to you. We said at the beginning of the talk, without knowing your problem yet after your conversion, when you mentioned his saying ﷺ ("you will follow the ways of those before you…") and that the Muslims became split into sects and parties and so on — now, unfortunately, you have felt from many of those you met of the Muslims and the officials that you did not find their sympathy; this is, without doubt, lamentable but not surprising. Why? Because we hinted in our previous speech that Islām (Islam) now is not implemented as required and expected of every Muslim, especially those in authority; therefore do not be overly distressed concerning those people because you did not believe in Allah and His Messenger only for their sake; rather you believed in Allah and His Messenger for the sake of the truth only. For this aspect I say to you: the Muslim today — and to divide him by his reality — the official Muslim’s stance toward new Muslims like you is like the stance of the enemies of Islām (Islam) in former times toward the weak who embraced Islām (Islam). You know perhaps from your general study how the earliest Muslims, when the Messenger ﷺ sent to all people as a bearer of good and a warner while he was in Mecca, he and the weak Muslims who embraced were met by the thugs of Quraysh and the disbelievers of Quraysh with pressure, beatings, killing and the like; you know this, so what was the position of those oppressed Muslims in the land?

P5511e - The Shaykh: That is exactly how you should be positioned now: remember that you did not believe in Allah and His Messenger ﷺ for wealth, honor, office, or such; so do not worry about those people, because you did not embrace Islām (Islam) for their sake but for Allah and His Messenger ﷺ. Now you have only two matters and no third: first, be patient as the resolute of the messengers and their followers among the sincere believers were patient; determine yourself to this patience until Allah brings you relief. Second, pursue the lawful means that provide you with an exit from the material distress you fell into because of your declaration. Is that clear, God willing? Therefore, "do not let your soul be distressed over them" — you did not believe for their sake; you believed in Allah and His Messenger and Allah, exalted is He, is with you. Allah, exalted is He, says in the Qurʾān (Book Name): "And those who strive for Us — We will surely guide them to Our ways." And as you heard from Mr. Abū Mālik, we are weak; we will be with you within the limits of our weakness and incapacity and poverty also. "And Allah does not burden a soul beyond its capacity"…
Abū Mālik: That is strength, our shaykh…
The Shaykh: We ask Allah to grant us His power and support from Him, and I tell you after all these reviews: do not humiliate yourself, do not knock on an official door at all; rather strengthen your ties with individuals among the Muslim brothers truly, especially those who call to the Kitāb and the Sunnah (The Corpus/Prophetic Tradition), not to partisanship nor to denominationalism nor to odious Sufism. Is that clear? This is my advice to you and I hope Allah will be with you.

P5511f - Another questioner: "And whoever fears Allah — He will make a way out for him and provide for him from where he does not expect" — so be reassured: if you are upon the Godfearingness of Allah, exalted is He, that Allah will make for you an outlet and provide for you; but you must know that tribulation is necessary. "Do people think that they will be left to say 'We believe' and they will not be tested? Indeed We tested those before them" — so that Allah may distinguish those who are truthful and those who lie. Therefore, it was of Allah’s wisdom, as our teacher and shaykh pointed out — may Allah preserve him — that the Muslims in the early Meccan period were killed and tortured and severely persecuted to the point that they complained to the Messenger ﷺ about what they encountered from Quraysh. Khabbāb ibn al-Art complained to the Messenger ﷺ while leaning on a garment in the shade of the Kaʿbah: "We have met from the polytheists great severity; O Messenger of Allah, will you not seek victory for us, will you not supplicate to Allah for us?" He was reclining and then sat and said: "Those who were before you were combed with iron combs between flesh and bone and a saw was brought to cut them in half; that did not turn them from their religion; by Allah, this will not occur until the rider can travel from Sanʿā' to Ḥaḍramawt fearing none but Allah and the wolf fearing for his flock; but you hasten." … The point is that if a believer believes in the truth he must be patient and find sweetness in the harm if it befalls him in the way of Allah, exalted is He. If you make your soul accustomed to finding sweetness in this harm and learn that it is because of faith, then you have tasted the true flavor of faith and then, even if you were cut limb by limb…

P5511g - …it will not harm you and you will find the sweetness of faith because you believed with certainty. But if faith is not like that, then, God forbid, one is like the person who worships Allah in a minimal way: "If good reaches him he is content with it, and if a trial befalls him he turns back on his heels and loses both this world and the Hereafter." Some people are in this condition. Allah intends to test and distinguish the bad from the good. This concerns your person. As for the Muslim society, that is another duty upon them which the shaykh pointed out: if the Muslim community does not fulfill its duty toward you then do not let that distress you or harm you — Allah will make for you an outlet. If He tests you, be patient, for this raises your rank and station with Him, exalted is He. The Messenger ﷺ says: "The best among them in the Age of Ignorance are the best among them in Islām (Islam) if they understand." So if you understand and comprehend your duty and hold fast to the truth you will have a high and great station with Allah, exalted is He. This is what I wished to point out. This also does not absolve my first word: it is your duty to invite your parents despite the harm you encounter from them, because Allah obliged you to good companionship with them. You must take means to treat them well and be gentle in inviting them. If you encounter harm in that path, be patient. Arguing with them in the best manner is obligatory upon you within your capacity. This requires discourse; I advise you to read in that regard especially al-Jawāb al-Ṣaḥīḥ li-man baddala dīn al-Masīḥ — Shaykh al-Islām Ibn Taymiyyah — and let your argument with them be that ʿĪsā, peace be upon him, is a servant of Allah and His Messenger like the other prophets: God created Adam from dust and they believe that God created Adam from dust — if Adam was created from dust, who is his father? They do not say he had a father, nor his mother; if Adam was created from dust they believe he is created and so they do not say he is the son of God. And they believe that Eve was created from Adam and has no father and we do not say she has a mother; rather she was created from Adam. So first God created the male without a father nor a mother, then He created the female from the male, then He created all people from male and female, and remained a type that God did not create — and He is capable of creating all things — which is to create a male from a female. God’s wisdom was that He created ʿĪsā from a female without a male, so he resembled Adam in that he has no father nor mother and resembled Eve who is from Adam; he was from a female without a male and differed from other people and is a sign of Allah, blessed and exalted be He, yet he is the servant of Allah and His Messenger. They should ask themselves why they did not say of Adam that he is the son of God?

P5511h - Why did they not say of Eve that she is the daughter of God, yet they came and said of ʿĪsā that he is the son of God, for he was created from a female without a male? They have no rational proof for that, let alone textual proof; thus they are contradictory and confused. Debate them on this point alone to demonstrate their error and that they are not upon anything. Also show them that ʿĪsā was foretold and the tidings remain in the Torah even in its corrupted form. Read in that what the modern writers have written, such as Aḥmad Deedāt and others, who mention the tidings by the name of the Messenger ﷺ and that the mention of the Messenger ﷺ remains in the corrupted Torah and Gospel. Allah, exalted is He, said: "And when Allah took a covenant from the prophets, 'Whatever I give you of a Book and wisdom, then there will come to you a messenger confirming what is with you, will you believe in him and aid him?' They said 'We have believed and taken upon that our pledge' — (then) 'Bear witness, and I am with you among the witnesses.'" Ibn ʿAbbās, may Allah be pleased with him, says: Allah did not send a prophet — and this is in Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī — without taking from him the covenant and the pledge that if Muḥammad ﷺ were sent while he is alive they would believe in him and support him. Every prophet before him — peace upon them — Allah took from them the covenant that if Muḥammad ﷺ were sent while they were alive they would believe in him, support him, and be among his followers. Likewise He took a covenant from their peoples that if Muḥammad ﷺ were sent while they were alive they would believe in him and support him; otherwise they have no path to Paradise. ʿĪsā, peace be upon him, who was one of Allah’s signs and whom Allah raised to Him — this is what the Christians erred about — he will descend and rule by the Book of Allah and the Sunnah (The Corpus/Prophetic Tradition) of Muḥammad ﷺ, and this is also part of fulfilling the covenant that Allah took upon the prophets, especially ʿĪsā, peace be upon him, who foretold Muḥammad ﷺ; he will return again — Allah will send him down to the earth — and he will rule by what Muḥammad ﷺ judged and will break the cross and kill the swine. This is in brief; the matter needs more detail, but may Allah benefit you with these words and we ask Allah, exalted is He, to forgive us and you and to resurrect us under the banner of the leader of the messengers.

P5511i - Another questioner: This matter repeats in the story of the conversion of Salmān al-Fārisī, may Allah be pleased with him, and how he suffered hardships at the beginning of the way. At the outset, when he was sold as a slave and had met or gone to that bishop who was wicked — that bishop called people to alms and urged them to give which all went to himself until he amassed seven jars of gold and silver…
The Shaykh: Like most of the priests and monks…
Another questioner: Yes, and at the beginning of the path there was a shock that caused Salmān, may Allah be pleased with him, to relapse and leave religion; as reported in al-Bukhārī he wandered…
The Shaykh: "From Lord to Lord."
Another questioner: Yes, for several years he went from lord to lord and from land to land and suffered many things — praise be to Allah — until his matter was set. We ask Allah to magnify your reward and recompense…
The Shaykh: May this kindness benefit you in your life; as we said, do not prevent yourself from seeking livelihood by lawful means compatible with the dignity of a Muslim. And your Lord says: "And We will surely test you with something of fear and hunger and a loss of wealth and lives and crops — and give good tidings to the patient." We command you — and I seek Allah’s forgiveness for the matter — but we remind you to be patient in the estrangement you met and that you sought nothing but what you were struck by earlier. Be patient and take refuge in that so that you are among those who when afflicted say, "Indeed we belong to Allah and indeed to Him we will return; those will have blessings and mercy from their Lord, and those are the rightly guided." The Messenger ﷺ says: "We, the community of the prophets, are the most severely tested; the best of the best, and the believer is tested according to his religion." I hope you consider with me this clause of the Prophet’s saying: "The believer is tested according to his religion" — the more severe the trial for a true believer the more patient he is, which is a sign of the strength of his faith. We hope for you that you be strong in faith to take shield with patience against anything you see unacceptable. Please proceed.

P5511j - Another questioner: Also, since you studied theology you are now more able to demonstrate the falsehood of the doctrines of the people and their contradictions and the contradictions in the Gospels which need a careful, aware, insightful study; then compare, show the truth and the error and falsehood of the people — this will be a breach in their defenses and call to the way of your Lord with wisdom and good admonition. Perhaps this will be a cause, and though this is not my main concern, it may be one of the ways to produce some books that defend Islām (Islam) and show the truth and might bring you some money for your worldly life — though this is not the aim, the primary aim is to support the religion of Allah. Given that you studied theology, we or the Muslims now need your efforts to expose the error of these people.
Another questioner: … the brother mentioned at the start that now he is being fought by his family and his funds were taken and the ground was pulled from under his feet — I say he is not alone; we young Muslims, from father to grandfather, when we adhere and hold fast to our religion we find persecution from some of our families…
The Shaykh: May Allah bless you.
Another questioner: He is not alone in this field — he has joined us in this field — so that may be consolation and consolation for him.
Questioner: … My family’s expectation of me — the one I spoke of — surprised me later when I reviewed the authorities for some matters…
Another questioner: These officials — if the family rejects this matter then a stranger who is a Muslim like you would be of first priority. I recently visited the awqāf and I told some people if he had gone to the Ministry of Arts or the Ministry of Tourism he would have found more respect and appreciation than he found at the Ministry of Awqāf — this is natural in this society…
Another questioner: This is my cousin who wears a cap; he recently committed and is an employee of a bank and now seeks to find work other than the bank and we ask Allah to facilitate for him; he is now persecuted. What happened to you? You do not attend weddings? You are crazy now — ask him; he is persecuted…
Abū Mālik: First, why did you leave the bank?!
Another questioner: How to leave the bank, I mean…
Abū Mālik: Praise be to Allah for the blessing of this religion, that Allah, exalted is He, illuminated his insight and Allah uncovered his chest and removed the gloom that was in him for whatever reason?

P5511k - Abū Laylā: In this religion this is a blessing… Praise be to Allah — Muslims, young men, elders, women and daughters who believe in this religion with true faith and leave this world and abandon it — this is a great blessing…
Another questioner: Do not let the devil enter your chest nor blow into your chest such weakness; you must accustom yourself that even if all people are at war with you you remain upon your faith so that you know the taste of faith and be reassured that you will not abandon your faith no matter what harm you suffer in this world; if you are thrown into the fire do not abandon faith — then you know the taste of faith and the sweetness of faith and taste it…
Abū Laylā: Excuse me, our shaykh — I hesitate to speak but I found that it is necessary to speak… A question: did the brother have Muslim friends?
Questioner: Yes.

P5511k (continued) - Abū Laylā: What was the presumed difference between us and them? We — our shaykh — were like them; we had Christian friends and attended Christmas with them; we went and came and such; yet, glory to Allah, there was no such difference. The name "this is a Muslim and that is a Christian" — I used to trade novelty clothing and sold the worst and the most scandalous fashions from Italy and France; my shop was very famous even the town’s immodest women would come buy from me and my shop was very successful worldly speaking; suddenly Allah guided me, and I met our shaykh — may Allah preserve him — and I was afflicted with debts to banks. I asked our shaykh — the first meeting with him — about banking transactions; he related to me two ḥadīth of the Prophet ﷺ, one about the man of the sect and the second about the man walking in the desert who heard a voice from heaven; finally, I am not an economist and by this I say you it is not permissible to deal with the banks. Glory to Allah, I was moved and began with the traders to collect these checks; anyone who owed me one piastre, there was no bank clearing the check, I would cash it myself; see how… I turned away from the forbidden in buying and selling, from miniskirts and dresses and trousers and jeans, and the customers were many. I used to spend daily tens of dinars — there were days I had only bread to eat and my children and I ate that because of the harshness — and from being daily at the kebab and… Why? Because I moved from one stage to another. Customers stopped finding fashions; I started to bring lawful goods and I had merchandise worth thousands of dinars but the goods offset each other in sales; I became patient and patient until some goods went bad and I discussed with our shaykh the issue of the miniskirt and I destroyed it, makeup, perfumes, etc. Praise be to Allah I endured and now the shop is considered one of the most famous shops for selling the jilbāb and lawful Islamic clothing and we do not approach the forbidden by Allah’s grace. Man must be patient…
The Shaykh: This is the crux: patience.
Abū Laylā: Yes.
The Shaykh: "Only the patient shall be given their reward without measure." Has the time come? Glory to You, O Lord, and praise be to You; I testify that there is no god but You; I ask Your forgiveness and repent to You.
Abū Laylā: May Allah reward you, our shaykh, and preserve you and lengthen your life.

P5512 - Questioner: The question asks: what is the criterion for the People of the Book to remain upon their religion such that marriage to them and eating their food is permissible for us?
The Shaykh: The criterion is that they remain affiliated to it in name, not in deed; for this was never established — nor on the day when He revealed, "And the food of those who were given the Book is lawful for you" — for He said of them… — may Allah have mercy on you — … He said of them, "Indeed those who said, 'Allah is the third of three' have disbelieved." This is my answer.

P5513 - Questioner: So if there is here a Christian who denies the Resurrection or denies the existence of the Lord, exalted is He, does this ruling apply to him?
The Shaykh: No. That person has left the Christian community.
Questioner: He is still affiliated to Christianity.
The Shaykh: Yes, he is affiliated, but what does affiliation mean? Affiliation does not mean that he practices the true Christianity that ʿĪsā, peace be upon him, brought. But if he denies Christianity altogether in every detail then he is a wicked one beyond doubt like the Muslim who apostatized from his religion; it does not help him to be called Ahmad ibn Muḥammad!

P5514 - Questioner: If two people dispute, is it permissible for one of them to bring his case before a court of the non-Muslims (one of the courts of the kuffār) in order to obtain his right which cannot be obtained except thereby?
The Shaykh: If he believes that the judgment issued by that court in that case does not contradict sharʿ then it is permissible for him; otherwise it is not.

P5515 - Questioner: Does a sham divorce effected as a fraud upon the law that prevents multiple wives constitute a binding divorce?
The Shaykh: If it is explicit…
Questioner: On the papers.
The Shaykh: If it is explicit, we have no option but to implement it and we do not look to the intention!
