P14 - The Questioner: ...and they are still alive, so what is the ruling of the Sharīʿah on that?
The Shaykh: If what is intended by the distribution is the hibah (gift) and the ʿaṭiyyah (present), then this has its own ruling. And if what is intended by it is the division of the mīrāth (inheritance) before its time comes, then this has another ruling. Then, each of the two rulings has a division that differs from the division of the other ruling. If the father wants, when he divides his wealth, to gift the money he has to his children, then here comes his statement ﷺ: (Be just between your children). So, he must equalize here between the male and the female. As for if what is intended is the division of the mīrāth, then this is premature firstly. Then, it may create conflict and disagreement among the children due to the hastening of the implementation of the ruling, and this is a ruling whose time has not yet come, because the mīrāth is only realized by the death of the testator.

P15 - The Questioner: Is the Messenger ﷺ visiting the cemetery at night specific to him, upon him be blessings and peace?
The Shaykh: No, it is not specific to him.

P16 - The Questioner: If Al-Ḥākim says in his Mustadrak: "This ḥadīth is upon the condition of Al-Bukhārī" and he did not extract it, and Al-Dhahabī affirmed him on that, or Al-Dhahabī said about the ḥadīth that it is ṣaḥīḥ, then is such a ḥadīth relied upon at that time? And is it used as proof just as any ḥadīth in the Ṣaḥīḥayn is used as proof?
The Shaykh: Here the answer differs regarding the general mass of people, and regarding some of the elite people, and by this "some" I mean: the scholars of ḥadīth. So regarding the general mass of people, their duty, as we began in the speech of this session, is to ask the people of knowledge. And there is no doubt that Al-Ḥākim is among the people of knowledge of ḥadīth regarding taṣḥīḥ (authentication) and taḍʿīf (weakening), especially if we measure him against one who has no knowledge—I do not mean the common people, but rather the elite of the end of times who do not study the science of ḥadīth—so it is from the obligatory matters that they refer back to him, and that they look: What is his position on the ḥadīth? If he authenticated it, they follow him, unless the error of Al-Ḥākim becomes clear by the judgment of another who is more knowledgeable in the science of ḥadīth than him. So with greater reason and appropriateness, if Al-Ḥākim authenticated a ḥadīth and Al-Dhahabī agreed with him on it, then the general Muslims must follow that, unless it becomes clear to them through transmission from a scholar that Al-Ḥākim fell into wahm (error/delusion), and Al-Dhahabī also followed him in his wahm. Then at that time, one returns from following him or following the two of them to following the correctness that became clear to him from other than them. As for the elite scholars of ḥadīth, then due to what they have been given of knowledge regarding the biographies of the narrators of ḥadīths firstly, and what they have been given of knowledge regarding the terminology of ḥadīth secondly, these ones, it is not obligatory upon them to follow Al-Ḥākim, nor even Al-Dhahabī, because it becomes clear to them in many instances that much wahm and error occurred in the taṣḥīḥ of the two. In short, just as it is obligatory on the general Muslims...
[Cut in the tape],
In one case, when the error of that faqīh or the error of that muḥaddith becomes clear to them, then the error: it is not permissible to follow it.

P17 - The Questioner: In the same chapter, Professor, how is the tasfiyah (purification/filtering) accomplished, when what is considered a ḥadīth by some muḥaddithūn is considered a ḥadīth ḥasan by others, and what is considered bad by some of them is considered ḥasan or ḍaʿīf by others?
The Shaykh: This, and no offense, is a "shanshanah (familiar trait) we know from Akhzam." The tasfiyah, we mean what is possible of it. The ḍaʿīf and fabricated ḥadīths spread in the books—which we mentioned—from the books of Tafsīr, ḥadīth, conduct, morals, and the like, are more than can be counted by the hundreds, strictly speaking, by the thousands. For I am a single person, and the number of ḍaʿīf and fabricated ḥadīths with me has reached until now approximately over six thousand ḍaʿīf ḥadīths, I alone. So what do you imagine if there was an abundance and multitude of people of knowledge specialized in the Islamic world?! They would unearth forms of such ḥadīths from the bellies of the books, many and very many. So why do we come to some ḥadīths in which some scholars of ḥadīth differ, as some say: "There are fiqh rulings also in which some scholars differed"? So we say: There are issues where it is established among the researchers in Fiqh that they are an error contradictory to the Book and the Sunnah, so they must be purified and removed from the path of the fuqahāʾ. Likewise, there are ḥadīths agreed upon regarding their weakness, nay, regarding their fabrication, so they must be removed from the bellies of the books and from the minds of the students of knowledge and likewise the scholars. There remain, no doubt, some fiqh issues and some ḥadīths that are a place of disagreement. The fact that something of that remains does not justify such a question, because we do not believe—contrary to what is rumored by some biased or ignorant people—that we want to unify all the Madhhabs, and make the four Madhhabs one Madhhab. We, I do not say: We are the most knowledgeable of people; we are the most knowledgeable of people that this is impossible. It is impossible to gather people on one Madhhab; it is impossible to gather people on one thought. But it is not impossible to bring people closer, especially Ahl al-Sunnah wa-al-Jamāʿah. Bringing them closer is possible—and this is a reality and witnessed. So those who study the Fiqh that is called today "Comparative Fiqh" (Al-Fiqh al-Muqāran)—even if this study in the universities is still superficial, because the doctor specialized in Sharīʿah and Fiqh presents the issue and the sayings that were said about it and the evidences of all of them, then he leaves the students bewildered, not knowing what the correct view is among these sayings because he presented their evidences. There might be a general verse and a detailed ḥadīth, and he does not say "This ḥadīth specifies the verse." There might be a Madhhab deducing evidence with a ṣaḥīḥ ḥadīth and another with a ḍaʿīf ḥadīth, yet he does not turn to distinguishing the ṣaḥīḥ from the ḍaʿīf and so on. So he leaves what?

P17a - The students bewildered. Therefore I say: This Comparative Fiqh today is taught as a superficial study. Those who study a complete study such that—as they say today also: they put the dots on the letters—they say: "This one, his evidence is such, and this one, his evidence is such, and this one his evidence... and the preponderant view is such and such, for the reason of such and such," these ones know that those who traverse this Fiqh methodology—which is called Comparative Fiqh—that it brings the Muslims closer together. And these are examples present before us today. Who from the students of knowledge has not heard of Imām Al-Shawkānī? Who from the students of knowledge has not heard of Al-Ṣanʿānī? Who from the people of knowledge has not heard of Ṣāliḥ al-Maqbalī? The author of "Al-ʿIlm al-Shāmikh fī Īthār al-Ḥaqq ʿalā al-Ābāʾ wa-al-Mashāyikh"? Who does not hear of these? No one. These, their origin is Zaydiyyah, Zayūd. They are neither Madhhab Ḥanafī, nor Shāfiʿī, nor Mālikī, nor Ḥanbalī. Meaning, in the expression of these four Madhhabs, those Zayūd are not from Ahl al-Sunnah wa-al-Jamāʿah. However, when they traversed this path which we call all Muslims to traverse so that they may draw close and love one another, and not draw apart and hate one another, then indeed there was realized in them what was realized in these Imāms whom we mentioned, where they became with us; they became Sunnīs; they began to refute the Zayūd because they oppose the Sunnah. So therefore, this methodology reconciles and does not divide. As for every human remaining on his Madhhab, then that is what divides and does not unify.

P18 - The Questioner: Is it permissible for me to perform Umrah twice in one trip, and I am from Jordan, so the first time is from Abyār ʿAlī and the second time from Al-Tanʿīm, like: ʿĀʾishah, may Allah be pleased with her? If it is not permissible, then is it permissible on behalf of his deceased father or on behalf of his mother? And may Allah reward you with good.
The Shaykh: He who wants to repeat the Umrah should return to the Mīqāt from which he entered iḥrām, and that is the same whether for himself or for his parents. As for entering iḥrām from Al-Tanʿīm, where the Lady ʿĀʾishah entered iḥrām, this is a ruling specific to ʿĀʾishah and whoever is like her. And I express this Umrah from Al-Tanʿīm as being the Umrah of the menstruating woman. That is because ʿĀʾishah, may Allah be pleased with her, when she went out with the Prophet ﷺ as a pilgrim in the Farewell Hajj, and she had entered iḥrām for Umrah, when she arrived at a place near Mecca known as "Sariḥ", the Messenger, upon him be peace, entered upon her and found her weeping. So he said to her: (What is wrong with you weeping? Have you got your menses?) She said: Yes, O Messenger of Allah. He said, upon him be peace: (This is a matter Allah has written upon the daughters of Adam, so do what the pilgrim does except that you do not perform Ṭawāf nor pray). So she did not perform Ṭawāf nor pray until she became pure in ʿArafāt, then she continued the rites of Hajj and performed the Hajj in full. When the Messenger, upon him be peace, resolved to travel and return to Medina, he entered upon her in her tent and found her also weeping. He said: (What is wrong with you?) She said: What is wrong with me? The people return with a Hajj and an Umrah, and I return with a Hajj without an Umrah. That is because due to her menstruation, her Umrah flipped into Hajj—Hajj Mufrad—so she is now weeping in regret over what she missed of the Umrah before the Hajj, while her co-wives like: Umm Salamah and others, returned with an Umrah and a Hajj; and for that she weeps. She says: Why should I not weep? The people return with a Hajj and an Umrah and I return with a Hajj. So the Messenger, upon him be peace, felt pity for her, and ordered her brother ʿAbd al-Raḥmān b. Abī Bakr al-Ṣiddīq to let her ride behind him on the she-camel and to go out with her to Al-Tanʿīm. So he did, and she returned and performed Umrah and her soul was pleased. Therefore we say: Whoever is afflicted by the likes of what afflicted her among women, where she menstruates while she is a muʿtamirah (performing Umrah) and cannot complete the Umrah, so her Umrah flips into Hajj, she compensates for what she missed by the same method that Allah legislated on the tongue of His Messenger for ʿĀʾishah. So this other menstruating woman goes out to Al-Tanʿīm and performs the Umrah. As for men, they, and praise be to Allah, do not menstruate, so what do they have to do with the ruling of the menstruating woman?

P18a - And the evidence is that, as some scholars of Sīrah and the conditions of the Ṣaḥābah say: One hundred thousand of the Ṣaḥābah performed Hajj with the Messenger; not one of them performed an Umrah like the Umrah of ʿĀʾishah, may Allah be pleased with her. So if that were good, they would have preceded us to it. Therefore, the one who wants to perform Umrah returns to the Mīqāt and enters iḥrām from there, whether for himself or for his mother and his father. And with this amount is sufficiency, and praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds.
The Questioner: If you permit me...
The Shaykh: Is it 11 o'clock?

P19 - The Questioner: What is the ruling on a sale contract based on a binding promise to purchase?
The Shaykh: Sale contract?
The Questioner: Based on the binding promise to purchase.
The Shaykh: You mean no sale occurred? Just a promise.
The Questioner: He buys, to sell it.
The Shaykh: A promise.
The Questioner: Uh, yes, a promise that he will buy, so he buys for him.
The Shaykh: As long as the sale has not occurred—my brother—then this promise does not bind the two transacting parties to the sale. However, fulfilling the promise, this is obligatory fulfillment from the perspective of moral conduct. But from the perspective of the judiciary and the Sharīʿah judgment, it is not binding. Is the answer clear? The question is done, in shāʾ Allāh.

P20 - The Questioner: A man deposited money at the Islamic Bank, so they used it in trade without the permission of its owner, and they did not give him anything from its profit. So is that permissible for them?
The Shaykh: Meaning: The Bank, is that permissible for it?
The Questioner: Yes, is it not so?
The Shaykh: He deposited it as what? A trust (amānah)?
The Questioner: Uh, yes.
The Shaykh: So the Bank came and used it?
The Questioner: Yes.
The Shaykh: Without permission from its owner?
The Questioner: Yes.
The Shaykh: Naturally this is not permissible. And at the very least, they must share the profit with him, and he does not share the loss with them if they lose, because if they lose, it is because they disposed [of the funds] without his permission. So a sayer might say: Then why should they share the profit with him? Because before us is the ḥadīth of the three who were in the cave, and all of you know that, and considering the time is very limited, I will leave it to your account not my account, but I will remind you of the part of the ḥadīth which is the point of evidence: That the man who worked for that rich man for a wage he named—and it was a faraq (measure) of rice—he said, upon him be peace: (So when he finished his work, he offered him his faraq, but he desired to leave it). Faraq means: A container or measurement as is known. He said: (Then he came to him) meaning after years, (he said: O servant of Allah, fear Allah and give me my right. He said: Look at those cows and sheep; go and take them. He said: O servant of Allah, fear Allah and do not mock me; I only have with you a faraq of rice! He said: Go and take them, for indeed those cows are from that faraq). So the Islamic Bank—considering it is an Islamic Bank—must adopt this character.

P21 - The Questioner: The contract that is agreed with him, meaning for example: agreed with him for ten years or a year, during the year it is possible if it was... ...
The Shaykh: I do not understand you. Let me strike an example for you. I am in a shop working in it. You come and say to me: "Will you vacate this shop for me? I am in need of it." So I say to you: "This shop, I am established in it, I earn my provision and the sustenance of my children..." to the end of it. So you say to me: "Yes, I know this, therefore I will give you something so you are satisfied." So we agree, and I vacate this place for you for a year, two years, to the end of it. So furuwiyyah (key money/vacating fee) and the annual rent likewise is named. Just as rent is agreed upon, it is usually agreed upon for a year, two years, three, four, to the end of it. This, I say: The furuwiyyah which I take in exchange for my vacating this shop for you, it is permissible for me to take it in addition to the annual or monthly rent. Up to here, what applies from your previous speech?
The Man: During the period of the contract for this furuwiyyah, you are now utilizing this shop, my shop for example, during a year. I, during the year, can open the shop but I pay you furuwiyyah or...
The Shaykh: I did not understand you. I say: The image, the image which I presented to you, the image which I presented to you, does your first speech which I did not understand apply to it?
The Questioner: Leasing with a vague duration where I can rent to the shop owner, meaning the tenant, vague duration of the lease contract.
The Shaykh: Not vague, I own it for a year or two years; he names the duration. I said this, O brother.

P22 - The Questioner: The Islamic Bank distributes the profits between the Bank and the client, and allocates a third percentage as "investment risk reserve." So if the client withdraws his funds, he is not given anything from the percentage that was allocated for the investment reserve. So what is the ruling on that? And what is the evidence for that?
The Shaykh: I do not see that this is permissible in Islam, because it is also from the chapter of consuming people's wealth unjustly. It is obligatory, if he withdraws the money, that he withdraws the capital and the profit which he deserves. And it is not permissible to hoard a portion of it for interests that they know. And with this amount is sufficiency, and praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds.

P23 - The Questioner: The saying of the Prophet ﷺ: (Whoever hears the call and does not come to it, then there is no prayer for him except from an excuse) or as the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said. So is the consideration here by direct hearing or by the knowledge of the entry of the time? Especially since hearing in these days may exceed several kilometers due to the presence of loudspeakers and the like.
The Shaykh: It is as the questioner noticed. The Adhān reminds of the entry of the prayer time. So if the Muslim remembered the time, attendance is obligatory upon him whether he heard the Adhān or did not hear. And he has no right to use the excuse that "I do not attend the prayer in congregation because I do not hear the Adhān." This is an excuse that has no value from the Sharīʿah perspective, because the objective of the Adhān is notification. So if notification occurred by a spontaneous method—a man came to the one in his store, in his factory, in his plant, in his house, and said: "Ḥayya ʿalā al-Ṣalāh, it has been called"—the response does not fall from him [as a duty] because he did not hear the Adhān directly, for he knew of the entry of the time. The consideration is by knowledge, and not by the means, the means of the Adhān. For the Adhān is a notification, but with known, precise Sharīʿah wordings narrated from the Messenger, upon him be peace, with ṣaḥīḥ isnāds.

P24 - The Questioner: The question says: Some āthār (narrations/reports) have been reported: That it is not permissible to enter Mecca except with iḥrām. So are they ṣaḥīḥ firstly? And what is the ruling on entering Mecca without iḥrām?
The Shaykh: We do not know of a confirmed ḥadīth from the Prophet ﷺ preventing the Muslim from entering Mecca except while he is a muḥrim (in iḥrām). This is firstly.

P24a - And secondly: It has been established that the Prophet ﷺ entered Mecca while upon him was the war helmet, and had he entered it as a muḥrim, he would have entered it with head uncovered as you know. Therefore, the scholars used the entry of the Messenger, upon him be peace, into Mecca while upon him was this helmet as evidence that he entered it while he was ḥalāl (non-muḥrim); he entered it while he was not a muḥrim. And from here: The answer to the last question is taken: What is the ruling on entering Mecca without iḥrām? It is a permissible matter except for the one who was intending Hajj or Umrah, for it is forbidden for him to cross the Mīqāt let alone enter Mecca while he is not a muḥrim. Whoever wanted Hajj and Umrah, iḥrām is necessary. As for whoever did not intend Hajj nor Umrah, then his entry into Mecca is like his entry into Medina; there is no difference.

P25 - The Questioner: Is kufr (disbelief) interpreted as juḥūd (denial/rejection) only from the terminological perspective? Or are there other forms of kufr by which it is interpreted, such as turning away, arrogance, refusal, and others?
The Shaykh: Yes, this question is not applicable, because we have divided kufr into two parts:
1 - Practical Kufr (Kufr ʿAmalī).
2 - And Doctrinal Kufr (Kufr Iʿtiqādī).
So therefore, this is an answer presented in advance. When we advanced with this division and said: That kufr may be Practical Kufr and not Doctrinal Kufr, then therefore kufr does not only mean: Juḥūd. Rather, it also means another meaning. Of that: What came in the question of the questioner. It may be kufr of a blessing (ingratitude), for example: (They deny [yakfurna] the blessing or deny the husband) as came in the ḥadīth of Al-Bukhārī regarding women.
Therefore, kufr has several meanings in reality. But regarding what was related to our previous research, the kufr related to the abandoner of prayer and other than prayer: Either it is kufr in the sense of jaḥd (denial), so he is an apostate from his religion. Or it is kufr in the sense: that he does the deed of the kuffār so he does not pray; so this one, kufr is not applied to him [in the major sense], but rather he engages in fisq (defiance/sin).

P26 - The Questioner: Is kufr interpreted as juḥūd only from the terminological perspective? Or are there other forms of kufr by which it is interpreted, such as turning away, arrogance, refusal, and others?
The Shaykh: Yes, this question is not applicable, because we have divided kufr into two parts:
1 - Practical Kufr.
2 - And Doctrinal Kufr.
So therefore, this is an answer presented in advance. When we advanced with this division and said: That kufr may be Practical Kufr and not Doctrinal Kufr, then therefore kufr does not only mean: Juḥūd. Rather, it also means another meaning. Of that: What came in the question of the questioner. It may be kufr of a blessing, for example: (They deny [yakfurna] the blessing or deny the husband) as came in the ḥadīth of Al-Bukhārī regarding women.
Therefore, kufr has several meanings in reality. But regarding what was related to our previous research, the kufr related to the abandoner of prayer and other than prayer: Either it is kufr in the sense of jaḥd, so he is an apostate from his religion. Or it is kufr in the sense: that he does the deed of the kuffār so he does not pray; so this one, kufr is not applied to him, but rather he engages in fisq.
The Shaykh: ..., a communal obligation (wujūban kifāʾiyyan), and the individual obligation is prioritized over the communal obligation. But naturally no one should understand from this answer of mine that it is obligatory upon him to learn the recitation of the Qurʾān according to the seven Qirāʾāt (readings), nay, the ten, no. But rather, if he reads Al-Fātiḥah, he reads it as it was sent down upon the heart of Muḥammad, upon him be peace. If he reads: «Say, He is Allah, One», «Indeed, We have granted you al-Kawthar» at least from these short Sūrahs, also: It is necessary that he reads them upon the correct mode according to the people of knowledge of Tilāwah. As for occupying himself away from that with what is not an individual obligation upon him, then this is like the one who prays in the night while the people are sleeping, but still ... the obligatory prayers in the broad daylight.

P27 - The Questioner: Is it permissible to diversify the dhikr in a rakʿah or a prostration?
The Shaykh: You mean tasbīḥāt?
The Questioner: Meaning several awrād (litanies), with several formulas.
The Shaykh: There is no prevention.
The Questioner: Was that reported?
The Shaykh: No, there is no text, but it was reported that he says such and says such.
The Questioner: Meaning: Gathering them in one rakʿah is permissible?
The Shaykh: Gathering them in one rakʿah?
The Questioner: Yes, that he gathers them all in one rakʿah, that he says: Subḥāna Rabbī al-ʿAẓīm, meaning or in one prostration.
The Shaykh: I did not understand the question like this.
Man from the audience: This is his intent, but perhaps he, ...
The Shaykh: Then I say the answer: This gathering, if it is in the likes of the prayer of Qiyām or Tarāwīḥ, it is permissible, and I mentioned this in the "Ṣifat al-Ṣalāh" (Description of the Prayer). As for if it is a normal prayer, then there is no need for him to gather.

P28 - The Questioner: If the man touches the private part of his wife, is his wuḍūʾ invalidated, and vice versa?
The Shaykh: If it was without shahwah (lust/desire), no. If the touching or contact was without shahwah, his wuḍūʾ is not invalidated.
Some of the audience: What is the limit of shahwah, our Shaykh?
The Shaykh: The virile man knows.

P29 - The Questioner: Is seeing Allah in a dream possible?
The Shaykh: This is said, and Allah knows best.
The Questioner: Regarding the Messenger of Allah?
The Shaykh: The Messenger, it is reported.

P30 - The Questioner: If there is a man who does not pray, and he repented to Allah and began to pray, then does this one have to pray the prayers that he missed or make up the fasting that he missed?
The Shaykh:
Firstly: He must repent to Allah for what he did of his turning away from the prayer in those days.

P30a - Secondly: Repentance, its conditions are known naturally: that he persists in the prayers at their times, and that he increases the nawāfil (voluntary prayers) to compensate for what he missed of much good due to his wasting of the prayer in those days.

P31 - The Questioner: My Shaykh, regarding the first ḥadīth that the Prophet ﷺ saw his Lord in the dream, what is its interpretation, its reading is its interpretation?
The Shaykh: Not only.

P32 - The Questioner: Does the Muslim student who went out seeking knowledge in the lands of kufr have the right to marry a Christian woman? And in his soul is a premeditation and confirmation that he will leave her and divorce her after a specific determined period, without agreeing with her beforehand on that, but the matter is between him and his soul because he feared fitnah for himself?
The Shaykh:

P32a - Firstly: We do not advise a young man to marry a Kitābiyyah (woman of the Book) today.
And the reason for that: Is that many of the Muslim youth, when they marry Muslim women, their lives become gloomy and bad, due to the bad character of the Muslim girl. And there may be added to that: The bad character of her family, from her mother, her father, her brother, and her sisters and to the end of that. So what will the Muslim be if he marries a Christian woman?

P32b - Her character, her habits, her jealousy and the like, and her sense of honor (nakhwah), differ. If jealousy and sense of honor have a mention among them, they differ completely from what we, the assembly of Muslims, have. Therefore we do not advise such a marriage, even if the Qurʾān is explicit in the indication of the permissibility of that. However, Allah only permitted the Muslim to marry the Kitābiyyah in the state where the Muslims are mighty, strong in their dīn, in their character, in their dunya, and the nations fear their awe. Therefore, the issue differs from time to time. In the first time, the Muslims used to fight the kuffār and capture hundreds of them, enslave them, and take them as servants. So their enslavement of them would be the cause of their happiness in their dunya and their Hereafter—the cause of the happiness of the captives, the enslaved, and the servants. They become happy in the Dunya and the Hereafter. That is because their Muslim masters used to treat them with a treatment they do not find in their lands amongst each other while they are free, due to the instructions that the Messenger, upon him be peace, used to direct to his Companions. Of that: His statement, upon him be peace: (Feed them from what you eat and clothe them from what you wear) to the end of what is there of many ḥadīths; I do not recall right now other than this. And the Messenger, upon him be peace, pointed to this reality which occurred later, in his statement in the ṣaḥīḥ ḥadīth: (Indeed your Lord marvels at peoples who are dragged to Paradise in chains). (Indeed your Lord marvels at peoples) meaning: from the Christians, from the kuffār. They are dragged to Islam which leads them to Paradise in chains. Today the case is completely reversed. The power and might for the Muslims is gone, as they have been humiliated by the most humiliated of people as is the reality with extreme regret. So if we assume that a young man married a Christian woman and came with her to here, this Christian woman will mostly remain upon her religion and upon her tabarruj (display of beauty), and the Islamic current will not sweep her away as it used to sweep the captives and imprint them with the stamp of Islam, because this society is Islamic in terms of name, but in terms of its reality, it is not so. For the nudity present for example in the Islamic homes today, except what Allah wills of them, is like the nudity present in Europe, and perhaps it is more corrupt than that. So therefore, this Christian wife, when he brings her, will not find the atmosphere that drags her and pulls her to Islam with a pull.
Man from the audience: She pulls him.
The Shaykh: Yes? As I said, it might be the opposite. This is firstly.

P32c - Secondly: If one of these young men marries a wife, he is not in need of intending that intention. Which is: That he will remain, for example, in study there for four years, so to immunize himself and prevent himself from falling into zinā (adultery), he marries a Christian woman from there and intends in himself to divorce her if he resolves to return to his country. We say to him: This intention firstly: is not legislated. Because Nikāḥ al-Mutʿah (temporary marriage), even if its form is in the stipulating of the verbal pronouncement between the two marrying parties, the man and the woman—and this naturally was abrogated until the Day of Judgment, forbidden until the Day of Judgment—yet the Islamic rule which the famous ḥadīth contains: (Deeds are only by intentions and for every person is only what he intended) stands between the Muslim and his marrying a woman while intending to divorce her after four years. This is if there was in this aspect a benefit for him or a necessity compelling him to it. But in reality, there is no necessity for this young man, if he sees himself in need of marrying a Christian woman, to intend this bad intention. Because why does he intend this intention? When the Sharīʿah has given him in advance the permissibility of divorcing whenever the man wills. This is from one angle.
From another angle: This intention, if he intended it and it had an effect in the Sharīʿah, that means he is obligated after four years to divorce her. Otherwise: Why did he intend this intention? Meaning: This intention either has an effect or it does not have an effect. We believe it has no effect. So if he is with us in that, then why does he intend this intention as long as it has no effect? And if it had an effect as we think from the likes of this question, then at that time why does he restrict himself with shackles? Does he not have the freedom of divorce if it appears to him after a year, not after four years? Meaning: The man may marry this Christian girl and find her a girl who does not reject the hand of a toucher in the real sense and not the metaphorical sense. So at that time, if he has Islamic jealousy, he will be compelled to divorce her before the passing of the period which he imposed on himself. Therefore, there is no benefit neither by Sharīʿah nor by logic for the young man to intend this intention. Rather, he marries this girl while knowing that the Sharīʿah permits him to divorce her if he finds the Sharīʿah interest or social interest to divorce her. And he may enjoy her for four years—this happens and has happened repeatedly even if this is rare—so he finds her better than many Muslim wives. Then at that time why did he bind himself in advance that after four years he will divorce her?

P32d - Let him untie himself from this restriction or not restrict himself with this restriction. Then if his study ends, he looks at his relationship with this woman: Is it natural and suitable that she returns with him to the lands of Islam? Then at that time he returns with her, because that is good. No, by Allah, this one is not suitable there for a reason or more than one reason; he divorces her. With us, marriage is not like the marriage present among the Christians, no. «Divorce is twice, then retention with fairness or release with kindness.» So if the matter is like that, then any young man, we advise him not to marry a woman of the Book. If he refuses except to marry, the second advice comes: He should not restrict himself that he will divorce her after the study years end, because he has the right to divorce her whenever he wills. He may hasten the divorce, and he may delay the divorce, and he may not divorce at all. And peace be upon you and the mercy of Allah.

P33 - The Questioner: Is it necessary on Friday, if a person performs ghusl, to perform wuḍūʾ so that he may pray?
The Shaykh: If his ghusl was not invalidated, no, it is not necessary. And peace be upon you.

P34 - The Questioner: Regarding hanging some pictures like: Al-Masjid al-Aqṣā, and the Mosque of the Rock (Dome of the Rock), meaning in the houses, is this permissible, our professor?
The Shaykh: If intended by the question is that they have the ruling of pictures that have souls (living beings), the answer: They are not like that. But if intended is in a general form, then we say: This is from what is disliked (makrūh), because it is from the chapter of decoration and adornments regarding which Islam does not encourage the use of these matters. Especially if the hung object contains something the Sharīʿah does not acknowledge. And here you have a very important point. Meaning the Mosque of the Rock contains a rock; it is from error that a specific holiness or specific virtue is believed regarding it. On the contrary, this is an error Islam does not acknowledge. So when a picture is placed in the house in a place that makes one feel and suggests that this placer supports the holiness of this thing whose picture he placed on his wall, there is no doubt that this is error upon error. This is regarding the Rock. When we leave the Rock for the Mosque of the Messenger, upon him be peace, for example, we hung the picture. The same thing is said: Building the mosque upon this form is not legislated. So your hanging of it suggests or makes one feel that you acknowledge the likes of this matter existing in this picture. And so on. So one should distance oneself from these pictures.
Man from the audience: There is another thing, my professor, that these pictures, naturally the Dome of the Rock, there appear with the picture about four or five churches in the same picture, and sometimes not.
The Shaykh: This is another matter.
The Questioner: Good, is this permissible, my professor? ...
The Shaykh: What you knew is sufficient in the answer. If there are churches and crosses, then the matter is more dangerous.

P35 - The Shaykh: I have a notification on something; people are in heedlessness regarding many Sharīʿah issues.
Of them: The entrant enters the mosque just as we entered, so he sits and does not pray the greeting of the mosque (Taḥiyyat al-Masjid), while it has been authenticated from the Messenger, upon him be peace, that he said: (If one of you enters the mosque, let him not sit until he prays two rakʿahs). This is one.
The second one: He enters the mosque and prays in any place available to him for prayer. And this is heedlessness of ḥadīths.
The summary of these ḥadīths is that every praying person who wants to pray must pray towards a sutrah (barrier). So I prayed here for example, this is my sutrah; our brother prayed there between the wood, this wall is his sutrah; this is his sutrah. You for example prayed here, where is your sutrah? There is none. And the reason? People are in heedlessness. There is no one to remind them as we said there. So I remind, and the reminder benefits the believers. Two ḥadīths from the Messenger, upon him be peace:
One of them says: (If one of you prays, let him pray towards a sutrah; let not Satan cut his prayer).
The second ḥadīth: (If one of you prays, let him draw near to his sutrah). Why did you not draw near? May Allah guide you. (If one of you prays, let him draw near to his sutrah) meaning: Do not be far from it. Here a question arises: How close must he be to the sutrah? The ḥadīth came in Ṣaḥīḥ Al-Bukhārī that the Prophet ﷺ used to be, if he prayed, between him—between the place of his prostration—and the sutrah was the passage of a sheep? Meaning: A span and a half, two spans at most. So this sutrah, for example for the one whose head is here, he does not butt the sutrah with his head either—meaning: sticking his head to the sutrah—but rather he places between his head and the sutrah the passage of a sheep. This is what I wanted to notify about:
Firstly: If the entrant enters the mosque, he must not sit in the mosque except after he prays two rakʿahs.

P35a - Secondly: He must pray towards a sutrah: the wall of the mosque, the column of the mosque... to the end of it.
One of the audience: For example: You found someone on this assembly... and you found the first row full with worshippers and you came behind him.
The Shaykh: Are you speaking about the congregational prayer??
The Questioner: Congregational prayer and other than congregation...
The Shaykh: Your sutrah is the first row.

P36 - The Questioner: A question, Sir...
The Shaykh: Go ahead.
The Questioner: Regarding the Fajr prayer, that in some mosques he calls the Adhān two Adhāns. So is it reported or not reported, the two Adhāns?
The Shaykh: Ah, how is it not reported? It is reported in the Ṣaḥīḥayn. Pray the greeting of the mosque, may Allah bless you, two rakʿahs, and draw near to the sutrah, to the wall.
The Questioner: There is on Friday...
The Shaykh: This question, you took the head of the answer. I want to give you the evidence. He said, upon him be blessings and peace: (Let not the Adhān of Bilāl deceive you, for he calls the Adhān at night, so eat and drink until Ibn Umm Maktūm calls the Adhān). You see, he has two muʾadhdhins: One of them: Bilāl, there is no one who does not know him. And the second: Ibn Umm Maktūm, his name is: ʿAmr.
He said to them: When you hear the Adhān of Bilāl, do not be deceived by it and say: "It's done, there is no eating left." No, he calls Adhān at night. And in a narration: (For he only calls the Adhān)—meaning: before the rising of Fajr—(he calls the Adhān so that the sleeper may stand and the one taking suḥūr may take suḥūr. So eat and drink until Ibn Umm Maktūm calls the Adhān). And he was a blind man who did not see the Fajr, so he used not to call the Adhān unless some passersby passed by him and saw the Fajr and said to him: "You have entered the morning, you have entered the morning." Then at that time he would call the Adhān, because he was blind and did not see.

P36a - The point is that they are two. One calls the first Adhān so that the sleeper wakes up, catches either the Witr prayer or the night prayer, catches the suḥūr if he wants to take suḥūr. So the Messenger says: (So eat and drink until Ibn Umm Maktūm calls the Adhān). When did he used to call Adhān? If the Fajr rose and the passersby saw it and said to him: "You have entered the morning, you have entered the morning," then at that time he calls the Adhān. This Adhān which Ibn Umm Maktūm used to call, is the one that prohibits food and permits the prayer. You see? So there are two Adhāns, and there is profound wisdom in this. With regret, today...
Man from the audience: In Ramadan, naturally this is?
The Shaykh: All days of the year.
The Questioner: All days of the year?
The Shaykh: He mentioned [it], because you know there are people who fast outside of Ramadan voluntarily. Mondays for example, Thursdays. There are people who fast a day and break fast a day. There are people who have Qaḍāʾ (makeup fasts) owed, especially women whom Allah tried with menstruation. So how do these know if the time to leave food has come or if there is time? I know of incidents—meaning—very unfortunate. We go down to the mosque in Ramadan before the second Fajr, the second Adhān. One goes down and some people pass by him, anxious, you feel that he just now woke up from sleep. "Please, is there time for us to take suḥūr?" And I used to hear with my ear, the answer: "No, there is no time." Why? "Because the Adhān of Imsāk (withholding) was called!" You know the Adhān of Imsāk; this is an Adhān against Imsāk. Because the Messenger said: (Eat and drink). Glory be to Allah, how the matter changes? The Messenger said: (Eat and drink until Ibn Umm Maktūm calls the Adhān). When did he call Adhān? If the Fajr rose. So the Imsāk, when they dispense it in... before the Adhān by a quarter of an hour, you find a Shaykh and Imām of a mosque, one comes to him anxious saying: "I did not take suḥūr, do I have time?" He says to him: "No, because the Adhān of Imsāk was called." While he called the Adhān of feeding: (So eat and drink until Ibn Umm Maktūm calls the Adhān).

P36b - The point, my brother: Is that the two Adhāns are throughout the year. Then do not forget that the issue is not just for the sake of fasting as I mentioned to you. He said in a narration: (So that the sleeper may stand) stand to pray. Meaning, and you know as I think that delaying the night prayer (Qiyām) is better than doing it early. But this, naturally, not all people are capable of it. However, he who cannot delay the night prayer, let him pray it after ʿIshāʾ, as most people do today; there is no prevention. But some people have ability, have free time for example, but he may not be alert. He hears the first Adhān so he wakes up just as he wakes up for the second Adhān for the prayer and going to the mosque. So therefore, the first Adhān is legislated like the second Adhān throughout the year. Is the answer clear?

P37 - The Questioner: Regarding the Jumuʿah prayer, the muʾadhdhin calls the Adhān, naturally you come to pray two rakʿahs Sunnah of Jumuʿah..., after the muʾadhdhin calls Adhān, standing up: is it permissible or not?
The Shaykh: Is it permissible? What is it?
The Questioner: The two rakʿahs... what... above you find him praying two rakʿahs Sunnah...
The Shaykh: There is no Sunnah of Jumuʿah, O brother. This Sunnah of Jumuʿah known today among many people has no origin in the Sunnah. Why? I narrate to you a ḥadīth from Ṣaḥīḥ Al-Bukhārī, the most authentic book after the Book of Allah, with its ṣaḥīḥ isnād from Al-Sāʾib b. Yazīd, he said: "The Adhān in the era of the Prophet ﷺ was the first Adhān only; if the Messenger, upon him be peace, ascended the minbar, the muʾadhdhin called the Adhān. If the muʾadhdhin finished the Adhān, the Messenger stood to deliver the khutbah." There is no place for the prayer of Sunnah of Jumuʿah Qabliyyah (pre-prayer). And the ḥadīth has a continuation, if Allah wills we will come to it shortly. The Sunnah on Friday, the Muslim must maintain it:

P37a - Firstly: Going early to the mosque. Do not sit; pray the greeting of the mosque. Being early in attending the mosque, the earlier he is, the better it is. Due to his statement ﷺ: (Whoever went in the first hour, it is as if he offered a badanah) «badanah means a camel, (And whoever went in the second hour, it is as if he offered a cow. And whoever went in the third hour, it is as if he offered a horned ram. And whoever went in the fourth hour, it is as if he offered a chicken. And whoever went in the fifth hour, it is as if he offered an egg. Then the scrolls are folded). So the earlier he is, the better it is. He entered the mosque early or late, he prays what is facilitated for him: two rakʿahs, four, six, eight, without calculation. Because this is named: Nāfilah (voluntary). Not a Sunnah that the Messenger defined in his mind, upon him be blessings and peace, no. And therefore he said, upon him be peace, in the ṣaḥīḥ ḥadīth: (Whoever performed ghusl on Friday and caused [his wife] to perform ghusl, and went early and arrived early, then prayed what appeared [good] to him, then drew near to the Imām and listened, except that he is forgiven what is between him and the Friday that follows it). Therefore, the one who enters the mosque on Friday prays what appears good to him, he and his energy, he and his time. As for this which occurs today, this has no origin in the Sunnah absolutely, ever. This occurred how? How did there come to be two Adhāns? In the time of ʿUthmān b. ʿAffān, Medina expanded with its inhabitants. Medina when the Messenger, upon him be blessings and peace, first migrated was like a village naturally. Islam spread, the Ṣaḥābah began to come, to settle, bit by bit. In the time of ʿUthmān, may Allah be pleased with him—meaning his Caliphate—Medina became, mā shāʾ Allāh, a town, the capital of the Islamic State. So an idea appeared to him, and what an excellent idea it was, considering that even until today as you know Jumuʿah is not prayed except in the Prophet's Mosque. And the matter was likewise in the time of the Messenger and Abū Bakr and ʿUmar and ʿUthmān. But due to: The expansion of the buildings in Medina, the people who were outside Medina and in a market called Al-Zawrāʾ did not hear the Adhān in the Prophet's Mosque. So he placed an Adhān there. This, let us call it a second Adhān. But this in reality: is a second Adhān, considering: that the first Adhān is the one which the Messenger, upon him be peace, came with. This is named: Second Adhān, because ʿUthmān came with it after the first. But he only came with it to make the people who were in the market hear that the Jumuʿah prayer has arrived, "Come on, Ḥayya ʿalā al-Ṣalāh." Where did ʿUthmān place the second Adhān?

P37b - In the market and a place known in the books of ḥadīth as Al-Zawrāʾ. The matter continued like this until the era of Hishām b. ʿAbd al-Malik the Umayyad. So it appeared to him to move the Adhān from Al-Zawrāʾ to the mosque. From that day, the situation differed. And with time, there came to be a gap between the two Adhāns; people occupied it with what they call "Sunnah of Jumuʿah Qabliyyah". And the Sunnah of Jumuʿah Qabliyyah has no place in grammatical analysis [no standing], as the grammarians say, because the Messenger in his time, as we said to you in Ṣaḥīḥ Al-Bukhārī: He used to go out from his house, ascend the minbar, Bilāl calls the Adhān, Bilāl finishes the Adhān, he commences the khutbah. So there was no place for the prayer of Sunnah, two rakʿahs, let alone four rakʿahs. This is the way for the one who comes to the mosque on Friday to pray what appears [good] to him. Then if the Imām ascends, he is silent. And that is all.

P38 - The Questioner: I want, O my brother—meaning—you to give me the opinion of the Sharīʿah on shaving chins (beards)? Meaning shaving the chin: I wonder, meaning, is shaving the beard permissible for them in the Sharīʿah or not?
The Shaykh: It is not permissible.
The Questioner: It is not permissible, decisively?
The Shaykh: It is not permissible decisively and by the agreement of the four Imāms.
The Questioner: What is the meaning of tanammus (plucking) in the ḥadīth: (Allah cursed the nāmiṣah [female plucker] and the mutanammisah [one who asks to be plucked])? Tanammus: Is it removing the hair that is above the chin, meaning in the back or where?

P38a - The Shaykh: In every place; in the eyebrow, the two cheeks, the face, everything. The Messenger ﷺ did not give permission in it for namṣ (plucking), only. You know, I think, that plucking the armpit is from the fiṭrah (natural disposition). So plucking the armpit is Sunnah, but plucking the eyebrows, plucking the cheeks, plucking the beard, shaving it is ḥarām, so plucking it is ḥarām. So when the Messenger ﷺ said: (Allah cursed the nāmiṣāt and the mutanammisāt and the wāshimāt [tattooers] and the mustawshimāt [ones asking for tattoos] and the fālijāt [those filing teeth for spaces]), he sealed the ḥadīth with his saying: (The changers of the creation of Allah for beauty). So everything the Muslim does for adornment and beautification while opposing in it the Sunnah of the Messenger, upon him be peace, then it enters into this ḥadīth. And especially since regarding the beard there are very many ḥadīths: (Trim the moustache, and leave the beards, and differ from the Jews and the Christians). In a narration: (Differ from the Majūs). Then: (Allah cursed the men who imitate women and the women who imitate men). In reality, O our Muslim brothers, we lived in a time where the kōfir colonized us, here the English and there France and I don't know, and London... to the end of it. These ones, when they entered the Islamic lands, they introduced into them their habits, their traditions, and their fashions. So the masses of Muslims were imprinted with all these disgraces. And especially since we were found in the end of a time far from the knowledge of Islam, far from Islamic cultivation, so we did not have immunity to resist these traditions which the kāfir brought to our lands. And the kāfir went out to where there is no return, but he left behind his culture, he left behind his habits and his traditions as we witness today. Even if today, praise be to Allah, there is an awakening, there is a return, there is a renaissance without doubt, but as it is said: The first of the rain is a drop then it pours. It comes with good, in shāʾ Allāh, and increases. We caught the students of knowledge in Damascus wearing a turban they call with us "lamlīk", meaning: yellow but it has its specific positioning. The students of knowledge were all clean-shaven, and their motto: The Yellow Turban (Laffah). Even though this Laffah has no origin in the Sharīʿah, while the beard, the four Madhhabs and other than the four, are commanding it, and the ḥadīths, as we mentioned some of them, have no value to them absolutely. Just that this is the motto for the student of knowledge. So the subject reversed today. Today you find youth who are not students of knowledge as you see, bearded. What is the reason?

P38b - They understood that this is firstly the Sunnah of the Messenger ﷺ—far be it that he shaves his beard in his time even once, and it is known in his descriptions, upon him be peace, that he had a majestic and great beard. And in addition to his practical Sunnah: His verbal Sunnah; he urged it. So people turned to these Sharīʿah realities and began to walk upon them and implement them. But many remained affected by the old previous habits. Therefore we advise every Muslim who is jealous for his religion and for following the example of his Prophet, upon him be blessings and peace, to save himself from the calamity of shaving the beard. Because this is without doubt fisq and disobedience; it contains opposition to the Qurʾān; it contains opposition to the action of the Messenger, upon him be peace; it contains opposition to his sayings; it contains imitation of the kuffār; it contains imitation of women. What bigger calamity do you want than this? And we ask Allah, Mighty and Majestic, to grant us all success to follow the Sunnah wherever it is. And we suffice with this amount, and praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds.

P39 - The Shaykh: [The speech is truncated at the beginning] They do not send blessings (Ṣalāh) on the Messenger ﷺ; they left this Ṣalāh for the muʾadhdhin only. Even though the issue is reversed. The muʾadhdhin, his function: Adhān and that is all. His Adhān ends with (Lā ilāha illā Allāh). Others, their function: To send blessings on the Messenger, upon him be peace. And the good one among them: Is the one who says: "Allāhumma ṣalli ʿalā Muḥammad," while it must be a complete Ṣalāh. There is a Ṣalāh we pray in the prayer which is named: The Ibrāhīmiyyah Ṣalāh. So this, after the response [to the Adhān], comes the Adhān, meaning: comes the Ṣalāh. After the Ṣalāh comes the duʿāʾ for him, upon him be peace, for the Wasīlah. And it is that he says: (O Allah, Lord of this perfect call, and the established prayer, give Muḥammad the Wasīlah and the Faḍīlah, and resurrect him to a praised station which You promised him). That is all, to here. There is no "Indeed You do not break the promise"; there is not; this is a footnote. As for what he said, upon him be peace, as is in Ṣaḥīḥ Al-Bukhārī: (Whoever says when he hears the call: O Allah, Lord of this perfect call, and the established prayer, give Muḥammad the Wasīlah and the Faḍīlah, and resurrect him to a praised station which You promised him, my intercession becomes lawful for him on the Day of Judgment). Thus is the ḥadīth. So remember these issues so we earn the intercession of the Messenger, upon him be blessings and peace. We answer the muʾadhdhin, then we send blessings on Muḥammad, upon him be ﷺ, then we pray for him with the supplication of Wasīlah.
