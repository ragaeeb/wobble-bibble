P1 - The Sheikh: Indeed, all praise is due to Allah. We praise Him, we seek His aid, and we seek His forgiveness. We seek refuge in Allah from the evil of our souls and from the bad consequences of our deeds. Whomever Allah guides, there is none to misguide him, and whomever He misguides, there is none to guide him. I testify that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah alone, without any partner, and I testify that Muḥammad is His slave and His Messenger. To proceed:
Verily, the best speech is the Speech of Allah, and the best guidance is the guidance of Muḥammad ﷺ. The worst of matters are the newly invented ones, and every newly invented matter is an innovation, and every innovation is misguidance, and every misguidance is in the Fire.

P1a - Perhaps the brothers present all know, from the indication of this Hadith and those like it which are established in the books of Sunnah and are of authentic chain of narration to the Prophet ﷺ, such as the Hadith of 'Ā'ishah: (Whoever introduces into this affair of ours that which is not of it, then it is rejected), and like the Hadith of 'Irbāḍ ibn Sāriyah, may Allah the Exalted be pleased with him, who said: "The Messenger of Allah ﷺ admonished us with an admonition that caused hearts to tremble and eyes to shed tears, so we said: 'O Messenger of Allah, advise us.'" He said: (I advise you to have Taqwa of Allah and to listen and obey, even if an Abyssinian slave is placed in charge over you. For indeed, whoever among you lives long will see much differing. So upon you is my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the Rightly Guided Caliphs after me; bite onto it with your molar teeth. And beware of newly invented matters, for every newly invented matter is an innovation, and every innovation is misguidance). These Hadiths confirm what I think you understand and believe: that innovation in the religion is entirely misguidance. I mean specifically in the religion, because blameworthy innovation is specific to the religion. As for matters of the world, some of it is praiseworthy and some of it is blameworthy. Depending on this new thing: if it opposes the legislation, it is blameworthy, and if it does not oppose the legislation, then it is at the very least permissible. One of the best statements transmitted on this occasion is the statement of Sheikh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah, may Allah have mercy on him, as he established a very important rule derived from those Hadiths plus other texts indicating that the basic principle in things is permissibility. This is a rule of Usul (principles). He said, may Allah have mercy on him: "The origin in religion is restriction except with a text, and the origin in the world is permissibility except with a text." He means: Every new matter in the religion is prohibited, while the new matter in the world is permissible unless it opposes a text, as we mentioned. Then, among what should be alerted to is that his statement ﷺ: (And beware of newly invented matters) only means every act of worship that originated after the Prophet ﷺ; it is misguidance, even if in the assumption of many people they consider it to be good. And truthfully did 'Abd Allāh ibn 'Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb, may Allah be pleased with him, speak: "Every innovation is misguidance, even if people see it as good." That is because deeming something good (Istihsan) in the religion means that this person who deems it good has equated himself with the Lord of the Worlds, for no one other than Him has the right to legislate except what Allah, Mighty and Majestic, has willed. For this reason, Imam al-Shāfi'ī, may Allah have mercy on him, said: "Whoever deems something good has legislated." Because how does this person who deems it good know that what he deemed good with only his mind and intellect—and did not derive it from the Book of his Lord or the Sunnah of his Prophet—where does he get the knowledge that this is a good matter?!
Therefore, our stance regarding every newly invented matter in the religion must be to refrain from it, based on what was previously mentioned of authentic Hadiths.

P2 - The Questioner: Some of the sitting brothers hear about the Salafi Call by hearsay, and they read about it what is written by its opponents, not by its followers and callers. So it is hoped from your virtue, and you are among the scholars of Salafism and its callers, to explain the position of Salafism among the Islamic groups today.
The Sheikh: I have answered a question like this more than once, but an answer is necessary since a question has been raised. So I say: A word of truth that no Muslim can dispute once the reality becomes clear to him:

P2a - First of that: The Salafi Call, it is an attribution to what? Salafism is an attribution to the Salaf (predecessors). So we must know who the Salaf are when the term "The Salaf" is used unrestrictedly by the scholars of the Muslims, and consequently, this attribution is understood, and what its weight is in its meaning and indication. The Salaf: They are the people of the three generations whom the Messenger of Allah ﷺ testified to regarding their goodness in the authentic Mutawatir Hadith extracted in the Two Sahihs and others, on the authority of a group of the Companions, from the Prophet ﷺ that he said: (The best of people are my generation, then those who follow them, then those who follow them). These are the three generations to whom the Messenger ﷺ testified regarding goodness. So Salafism belongs to this Salaf, and the Salafis belong to these Salaf. If we know the meaning of the Salaf and Salafism, then I state two matters:
The first matter: This attribution is not an attribution to a person or persons, as are the attributions of other groups present today on the Islamic earth. This is not an attribution to a person nor to tens of persons; rather, this attribution is an attribution to infallibility ('Ismah). That is because it is impossible for the Pious Predecessors (al-Salaf al-Salih) to unite upon misguidance. Contrary to that are the Successors (al-Khalaf); for no praise has come in the legislation regarding the Successors, rather dispraise has come regarding the majority of them. That is in the completion of the previous Hadith where he ﷺ said: (Then there will come after them people who testify but are not asked to testify...) to the end of the Hadith. Just as he ﷺ indicated that in another Hadith which contains praise for a faction of the Muslims and dispraise for the majority of them by the implication of the Hadith, where he ﷺ said: (A faction of my Ummah will not cease to be manifest upon the truth; they are not harmed by those who oppose them until the command of Allah comes) or (until the Hour is established). This Hadith restricted the praise at the end of time to a faction (Ta'ifah). And the Ta'ifah: it is the small group; for in the language, it applies to a single individual and upwards.
So then, if we know this meaning in Salafism, and that it belongs to the group of the Pious Predecessors, and that they are the infallibility regarding if a Muslim holds fast to what these Pious Predecessors were upon, then comes the second matter which I alluded to earlier, which is: That every Muslim, when he knows this attribution and what it aims for regarding infallibility, it becomes impossible for him after this knowledge and clarification to—I do not say: to disown it, for this is a self-evident matter—but I say: It becomes impossible for him except to be a Salafi. Because we have understood that affiliating with Salafism means: Affiliating with infallibility. From where did we derive this infallibility?

P2b - We take it from a Hadith which some of the Successors (Khalaf) use to argue for the contrary of the truth; they use it to argue for the authority of taking the opinion of the majority—from what the masses of the Successors are upon—when they bring his statement ﷺ: (My Ummah will not unite on misguidance). It is not correct to apply this Hadith to the Successors today given the radical differences between them. (My Ummah will not unite on misguidance) cannot be applied to the reality of the Muslims today, and this is a matter known to every student of this bad reality. Added to that are the authentic Hadiths that came clarifying what occurred among those before us from the Jews and Christians, and what will occur among the Muslims after the Messenger ﷺ regarding division. He ﷺ said: (The Jews split into seventy-one sects, and the Christians into seventy-two sects, and my Ummah will split into seventy-three sects, all of them in the Fire except one). They said: "Who is it, O Messenger of Allah?" He said: (It is the Jama'ah). This Jama'ah: It is the Jama'ah of the Messenger ﷺ. It is the one regarding whom it is possible to definitively apply the previous Hadith: (My Ummah will not unite on misguidance); that the intent of this Hadith is the Companions whom the Messenger ﷺ judged to be the Saved Sect. And whoever treads their path and heads in their direction. And these Pious Predecessors are the ones whom our Lord, Mighty and Majestic, warned us in the Noble Quran against opposing, and against treading a path other than their path, in His statement, Mighty and Majestic: "And whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him and follows other than the way of the believers - We will give him what he has taken and drive him into Hell, and evil it is as a destination." I have drawn the attention of our brothers on many occasions to the wisdom of our Lord, Mighty and Majestic, conjoining His statement in this verse: "and follows other than the way of the believers" to the opposing of the Messenger. What is the wisdom in that? Even though if the verse were without this sentence, if it were as follows: "And whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him - We will give him what he has taken and drive him into Hell, and evil it is as a destination", it would have been sufficient in warning and reprimanding the one who opposes the Messenger ﷺ, and judging him with a bad destiny. The verse was not like this; rather, it added to that His statement, Mighty and Majestic: "and follows other than the way of the believers". is this futile?!

P2c - Far be it for the Speech of Allah, Mighty and Majestic, to be futile. Meaning, whoever treads other than the path of the Companions, who are the infallibility in our previous expression, and they are the Jama'ah which the Messenger ﷺ testified for as being the Saved Sect, and whoever treads their path; these are the ones whom it is not permissible for anyone who wants to be saved from the punishment of Allah on the Day of Resurrection to oppose their path. Therefore He, the Exalted, said: "And whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him and follows other than the way of the believers - We will give him what he has taken and drive him into Hell, and evil it is as a destination."
So, upon the Muslims today in the end of times is to know two matters:

P2d - First: Who are the believers mentioned in this verse? Then, what is the wisdom of hearing the Quran and the Hadiths of the Messenger ﷺ directly from him, yet they did not have the virtue of witnessing the application of the Messenger ﷺ for the texts of the Book and Sunnah, a practical application? Among the wisdom stated textually in the Sunnah is his statement ﷺ: (News is not like witnessing). And from it the poet began and took his statement: "And a seer is not like one who heard." So, those who did not witness the Messenger ﷺ are not like his Companions who witnessed and heard the speech from him directly and saw from him the practical application. Today there is a modern phrase which some Islamic callers have excelled in, and it is a very beautiful phrase, but more beautiful than it is that we make it a realized reality. They say in their lectures, sermons, and guidance that we must make Islam a reality walking on the earth. Beautiful speech. But if we do not understand Islam in the light of the understanding of the Pious Predecessors, as we say, we cannot realize this beautiful poetic speech: to make Islam a realistic fact walking on the earth. Those who were capable of that were the Companions of the Messenger ﷺ for the two reasons mentioned previously: They heard the speech from him directly, so they retained it better than anyone else, then there are matters that require actionable clarification, so they saw the Messenger ﷺ clarifying that for them in action. I will strike a very clear example for you. There are verses in the Noble Quran that a Muslim cannot understand unless he is knowledgeable of the Sunnah that explains the Noble Quran, as He, Mighty and Majestic, said: "And We revealed to you the message that you may make clear to the people what was sent down to them." For example, His statement, the Exalted: "As for the male thief and the female thief, cut off their hands." Now bring the Sibawayh of this era in the Arabic language, let him interpret this noble verse for us. "The Thief": Who is he? Linguistically, he cannot define the thief. And "The Hand": What is it? The Sibawayh of the end of time cannot give the answer to these two questions: Who is the thief who deserves the cutting of the hand? And what is the hand that should be cut regarding this thief?

P2e - Linguistically: The thief, if he stole an egg, he is a thief. And the hand in this [context], if it were cut here, or here, or in any place, it is a hand. But the answer is when He mentioned the previous verse: "And We revealed to you the message that you may make clear to the people what was sent down to them." The answer is in the clarification. So there is a clarification from the Messenger ﷺ for the Quran. This clarification, he ﷺ applied it in action regarding this verse specifically as an example, and regarding other verses, and how many they are. Because whoever reads in the science of Usul (Principles of Jurisprudence) reads in the science of Usul that there is general and specific, absolute and restricted, abrogating and abrogated; concise words under which fall tens of texts, if we do not say hundreds of texts. General texts which the Sunnah has specified. I do not want to prolong this so that we can answer the rest of the questions.

P3 - The Questioner: If the family refuses that their daughter visits a sister of hers in Allah, and she misses her, and they always refuse this visit, does Islam allow her to go out to visit her without informing them of that? Or does she tell them something untrue?
The Sheikh: It is not permissible for her to visit her without the permission of her parents, just as it is not permissible for her to lie to them. Rather, she must convince the parents that the Wise Lawgiver orders this visit. If they are convinced, then so be it. And if they are not convinced, then it is not permissible for the girl, especially if she claims that she is committed to the Shariah, to exit from the obedience of her parents in the likes of this visit.
The Questioner: My teacher, regarding... does this apply to lessons as well? We are in a lesson, for example, an admonition about something?
The Sheikh: The same thing; permission is necessary.

P4 - The Questioner: What is the ruling on wearing the Khimar—covering the face and the hands—in the current time? And if the young woman feels Fitnah (temptation/trial) and chooses to wear it but the family refuses, especially the mother, then what should she do?
The Sheikh: If the refusal is limited to the face and hands, then obeying the parents is obligatory in that. However, if the refusal includes more than that, then there is no obedience to a created being in the disobedience of the Creator. Meaning: The woman must cover her entire body except the face and the hands; covering them is not obligatory, but it is recommended (Mustahabb). So if the parents do not accept that for their daughter, that she covers her face and hands, there is no objection to her obeying them, and there is no sin in that. Contrary to if they desired from her to uncover other than the face and hands, then in that case there is no obedience to them upon her, because that is a sin.

P5 - The scarf (Esharpe) is not sufficient. It must be a Khimar such that it covers the entire head and the upper chest (Nahr). The scarf is not ample, and its covering is not sufficient.
The Questioner: Does the covering include the shoulders as well, our teacher?
The Sheikh: Yes, this is the Khimar. The description of the Khimar is that it is loose and wide, covering the head and covering the shoulders. When we say: it covers the Nahr, then when it covers the Nahr it covers the shoulders because it is wide. As for the scarf, we often see women with something of the neck appearing because of the scarf, whereas the Khimar covers the neck and the shoulders together. And Allah commanded that, for He said: "and to draw their Khumur over their Juyub". As for this scarf, it is from the category of—as it is said today—half-solutions, and there are no half-solutions in Islam.
The Questioner: My teacher, many now from among the, meaning, those committed to the religion and in their dress believe that the Khimar is the face cover?
The Sheikh: This is ignorance of the language. The Khimar: it is the head cover. Therefore, the man adopts a Khimar (Yakhtamir), meaning: he places the Khimar on his head, and the woman likewise. Therefore He said: "and to draw their Khumur over their Juyub". If the Khimar were covering the face, He would not say: (draw/strike), meaning: fasten it. Rather it implies draping (Sadl). This is ignorance in the language.

P6 - The Questioner: If a woman wears a high heel in her shoe, is that permissible for her? And what is the ruling?
The Sheikh: It is not permissible to imitate the disbelieving women or the immoral women. The origin of this is from the Jewish women. They used to, in the old times before Islam, if one of them wanted to attend a gathering where her lover was, in order for him to see her, she would wear a type of high clog, so she would become tall and be seen. Then with time, this transformed into the sandal with the high heel. As for this sandal which makes the woman—meaning—change her gait, tilting right and left; and for that reason, the immoral disbelievers invented this type of sandal. So it is not befitting for the committed Muslim woman to wear a sandal with a high heel, especially since in many instances it is a cause for her harm and her falling on the top of her head if she trips in the path for the slightest reason.

P7 - The Questioner: Is it permissible to backbite the disbeliever and the polytheist woman? And is it permissible to curse them?
The Sheikh: All of that is permissible, because the disbeliever has no sanctity, unless a corruption results from behind that. For example: If he curses the disbeliever to his face or behind his back, and that reaches him, so perhaps he curses the Muslim and curses his religion and his Prophet, to the end of it. So at that point, the Muslim cursing the polytheist becomes forbidden.

P8 - The Questioner: In the verse: "None touch it except the purified", is the intended meaning of "the purified": the believers or those in a state of ablution (Wudu)? And what is the ruling on not taking the Quran to the disbelieving lands?
The Sheikh: The intended meaning of the verse is neither this nor that. Rather the intended meaning is: the Angels. It is an information from Allah, Mighty and Majestic, about the Angels. And this is not this Quran, but rather the one which is in the Preserved Tablet (al-Lawh al-Mahfuz). So this Mushaf (scripture) which is in the Preserved Tablet, "None touch it except the purified," and they are the Near Angels. This is an informative sentence, not a legislative sentence, meaning: issuing a legal ruling. Allah is speaking about the reality, that the Quran, meaning the one which is in the Hidden Book, meaning the Preserved Tablet, this "None touch it except the purified," and they are the Near Angels. As for the Mushaf which is between our hands, this is touched by the righteous and the wicked, and the believer and the disbeliever. So our Lord, Mighty and Majestic, does not mean mankind at all by this verse, whether they are righteous or wicked. Rather He means, as we said: The Near Angels.

P8a - As for traveling with the Quran and the Mushaf to the land of the enemy, it is not permissible unless it is secured that it will not be touched by evil or humiliated. So it is permissible then, if we are secure that the Mushaf will not be humiliated, it is permissible to introduce it to the land of the disbelievers, perhaps they—meaning—will be able to read it and study it.

P9 - [And the beginning of the answer is cut off] ...and therefore he ﷺ said: (Every creation of Allah is good). Yes, a man or a woman whose eyebrow is joined with the other, a human possesses no control over this. This is the creation of Allah, so we must be pleased with the creation of Allah as He, Blessed and Exalted, said... Yes, he mentioned the verse... The important thing is that our Lord, Mighty and Majestic... Now the verse came: "And your Lord creates what He wills and chooses; not for them was the choice. Exalted is Allah and high above what they associate with Him." This is the answer to the last question.

P10 - The Questioner Sheikh 'Alī Ḥasan al-Ḥalabī: Regarding reading the Quran and touching the Mushaf for the Junub (person in major impurity), what is the ruling on that? And circumambulation (Tawaf) of the House likewise.
The Sheikh: And Tawaf of the House, yes.
The Questioner Sheikh 'Alī bin Ḥasan al-Ḥalabī: Touching the Mushaf and reading the Quran—meaning—it is not part of a verse, nor for example seeking blessings or fear, something intentional; he touches the Mushaf and reads. So what is the ruling on that as well? Benefit us, may Allah benefit you.
The Sheikh: May Allah bless everyone. We say: There is no doubt that the remembrance of Allah, Blessed and Exalted, has its sanctity and its inviolability. Therefore, it is agreed upon among the scholars of the Muslims that reading the Quran in a state of complete purity is what is best and what is befitting the greatness of the Speech of Allah, Mighty and Majestic. And if it has been authentically reported from the Prophet ﷺ that he refused to utter a name from the names of Allah, Mighty and Majestic—which is (al-Salam)—except in a state of purity, in the Hadith known in the Sunan such as the Musnad of Aḥmad and others: That a man greeted the Prophet ﷺ, so he ﷺ did nothing but rush to the wall and perform ablution (Tayammum/Wudu) and returned the greeting, and said: (I disliked mentioning Allah except in a state of purity). To mention Allah, because (al-Salam) is a name from the names of Allah. Just as in the authentic Hadith in the book Al-Adab Al-Mufrad by Imam al-Bukhārī from the Hadith of 'Abd Allāh ibn Mas'ūd who said: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: (Al-Salam is a name from the names of Allah which He placed in the earth, so spread it among you). This Peace, the Messenger, upon him be blessings and peace, disliked returning it to the one who greeted him except in a state of purity.

P10a - The Quran, while he is not pure, whether minor purity or major purity, due to the absence of evidence prohibiting the Muslim from reading the Quran while he is on other than purity. However, this Hadith contains very clear encouragement to read the Quran while in a state of complete purity. But here is a thing: This ruling, which is "the best", in the most complete form, not every responsible Muslim is capable of it except the men only. As for the women, it is on and off. And you heard just now the statement of the Messenger ﷺ to the Lady 'Ā'ishah who menstruated; he said to her: (Do what the pilgrim does other than that you do not circumambulate nor pray). So at that point, it is not said to her: Perform ablution, as we say to the man, because she cannot lawfully perform ablution; she cannot lawfully purify herself. Therefore, she may read whatever she wills of the Quran without us saying: outweighed and weighty, as we say regarding the Junub man for example. We say: He must perform Ghusl (bathe), because he is capable of performing Ghusl, and thereby he purifies himself. So we say: It is better for you to perform ablution. As for the menstruating woman, as for the woman with postpartum bleeding, upon whom forty days or more pass in some instances or in a genus of the genders of women while she is in the state of Nifas (postpartum bleeding), so is it said to her: Do not read!? We do not have evidence preventing the Muslim generally, men let alone women, preventing them from reading the Quran except on purity. And the Hadith which al-Tirmidhī narrated in his Sunan from the Hadith of Ibn 'Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, who said: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: (The menstruating woman and the Junub do not read anything from the Quran); this is a Munkar (denounced/rejected) Hadith as the Imam of the Sunnah Aḥmad ibn Ḥanbal says. This Hadith is not authentic. If it were authentic, it would be obligatory to stop at it. In addition to the weakness of this Hadith and what may be in the chapter of its likes from the weak ones, before us is the Hadith of the Lady 'Ā'ishah where he ordered her and permitted her to do everything the pilgrim does, except that she does not pray or circumambulate. Do you see the pilgrim not reading the Quran? Rather, there is a season for reading the Quran, because there is free time and there is the turning of the pilgrim with his entirety to Allah, Blessed and Exalted. Without a doubt, he reads the Quran. So then, this Hadith contains a direct permission for the menstruating woman to read the Quran. So it is not permissible that we prevent the women from reading the Quran using the plea that she is not pure. If Allah had prevented her as He prevented her from prayer, we would have stopped at this prevention and ceased. But we find the Wise Lawgiver has revealed to the Noble Messenger to differentiate between the prayer and the parts of the prayer. Because some people say: "O brother, the reading is a pillar from the pillars of prayer! So why do we not mandate purity for this reading while it is a part of the parts of prayer?"

P10b - So we say: Reading is not the only thing that is a part of the parts of prayer. For the first thing the prayer is opened with is our saying: "Allāhu Akbar". So let us say: Then, it is not permissible for a Muslim to say: (Allāhu Akbar) except on purity, because it is a pillar from the pillars of prayer. Likewise, it is said about Tasbih (saying Subhan Allah), Tahmid (saying Alhamdulillah), and Takbir, to the end of it. There is no escape from that whatsoever. While maintaining what we mentioned, that it is better to mention Allah on purity. Likewise, it is said exactly regarding touching the Quran. Also, touching the Quran is legislated. Effects (Athar) have come from some of the Companions that they used to refrain actually—not intellectually—refrain intellectually [sic] from touching the Quran except on Wudu. So this contains a clarification of what is best for the one who wants to touch the Quran or to read the Quran. As for obligation and the statement that it is forbidden for the woman who is not pure, let alone the man, to touch the Quran, then there is no evidence for this ever. And people, without a doubt, imagine that there are evidences, but they are not evidence at all. From that, for example, is what is confused for many people, especially those who have a fondness and care for reciting the Quran, when he reads the statement of Allah, Mighty and Majestic, in the Quran: "None touch it except the purified." And the error has reached in carrying this verse upon this subject which we are in—meaning: that they interpret His statement, Mighty and Majestic: "None touch it" meaning: this Mushaf which is between our hands, "except the purified" meaning: except those with ablution. This illusion has reached the point that it is published on every copy printed in the Islamic world of the Noble Quran: a title "None touch it except the purified." And this is an error resembling another error; firstly from the perspective of intellectual scientific error, then from the perspective of its publication and generalization to the people secondly. The verse which is written on the Mihrabs (prayer niches): "Whenever Zechariah entered the sanctuary [Mihrab] to her, he found with her provision." The Mihrab means a window/niche. This is a lie; this is ignorance. The intended meaning of the Mihrab: is the place of prayer. "Whenever Zechariah entered the sanctuary to her" meaning: the room in which she was isolated from people worshiping Allah, Mighty and Majestic. This is the Mihrab. And the Mihrab is not this which has been introduced into the mosques since ancient times, unfortunately, influenced by the altars of the churches, the altars of the Christians in their churches. Otherwise, in Islam, there is no Mihrab. The Mosque of the Messenger ﷺ did not have a Mihrab. And the famous Egyptian Hafiz al-Suyūṭī—Hafiz al-Suyūṭī the author of (Al-Jami' Al-Kabir) and (Al-Jami' Al-Saghir) has a treatise, perhaps I have forgotten its title—yes—(I'lam al-Arib), and this is—meaning—a very valuable research.
He transmits there texts from the people of knowledge that the existence of Mihrabs in the mosques is from the newly invented matters.

P10c - The Witness (Point): The previous verse "None touch it except the purified" has no relation to the subject of touching the Quran which is between our hands. And this has a large explanation which I will summarize as much as possible, so I say: "None touch it," the pronoun here returns to the Hidden Book mentioned before, because Allah, Mighty and Majestic, says: "None touch it except the purified," referring back to the Hidden Book. This book of ours—and praise be to Allah—is not hidden (Maknun). Because what is the meaning of Maknun? It means hidden, preserved meaning, and you do not see it and the hands of the devils do not reach it. Therefore, Imam Mālik, may Allah have mercy on him, has a good understanding and very subtle in his book Al-Muwatta' in the interpretation of this verse, where he says: "The best of what I heard in its interpretation is that it is like the verse which is in Surah 'Abasa: 'No! Indeed, it is a reminder * So whoever wills may remember it * In records honored * Exalted and purified * By the hands of scribes * Noble and dutiful.'" Who are these scribes? The Angels. Those Angels are themselves the ones intended, that they touch, and that other than them do not touch that Hidden Book. This is a contextual indication (Qarinah). And there are other indications. And among the strongest of them: is that He, the Exalted, said: "except the purified" (al-Mutahharun). We, the assembly of humans, it is not permissible for us to describe ourselves, no matter how high we ascend and rise in righteousness and piety, that we are "purified" (Mutahharun). We are not "purified". And it is not permissible for a human to be "purified" ever. Rather we are polluted, and the righteous among us is the one who takes the trouble to purify himself (Yatatahhar). The righteous among us is the one who takes the trouble, meaning: creates the state of purity, otherwise it is not of his nature that he is pure. The "Purified" are the Angels described in the Noble Quran by His statement, Mighty and Majestic: "They do not disobey Allah in what He commands them but do what they are commanded." As for humans, they are the ones meant by Allah, Mighty and Majestic: "Indeed, Allah loves those who are constantly repentant and loves those who purify themselves (al-Mutatallirin)." Likewise when He mentioned the Mosque of Quba', He said: "Within it are men who love to purify themselves." So if we are like them, then congratulations to us, meaning we purify ourselves. As for "purified" (passive participle), then how far, how far.
So the witness from using this verse as evidence, and linking it to this subject, is a common error. And among the best of those who spoke on this verse, better than what we mentioned, and from him we derived, is the Allamah Ibn al-Qayyim al-Jawziyyah, in his book (Aqsam al-Qur'an). For there he elaborated and excelled. Perhaps in this there is sufficiency, if Allah wills.

P11 - The Questioner: What is the ruling on stipulating (Ishtirat) in Hajj and Umrah: (O Allah, my place is where You hold me back), and what is binding upon the one who stipulates a condition to complete his rites?
The Sheikh: The ruling on stipulating: Permissibility. Its fruit: That if he stipulates, the one who wants Hajj or Umrah, then something befalls him preventing him from completing the Hajj or the Umrah—and this is known in the language of the legislation as Ihsar (being blocked)—so if he is blocked, then [he must offer] what can be obtained with ease of sacrificial animals; this is an obligatory matter. Everyone who is not able to complete the Hajj, upon him is the sacrificial animal (Hady) and upon him is the Hajj in the coming year. Contrary to the one who stipulated at the beginning of his Ihram, and said: "O Allah, my place is where You hold me back," for he is absolved from the obligation of repeating the Hajj which was obstructed between him and it, and then the sacrificial animal is not obligatory upon him. Contrary to if he did not stipulate. This is what the Messenger ﷺ intended in the authentic Hadith known from him, which is his statement ﷺ: (Whoever breaks [a bone], or becomes sick, or becomes lame, then he has exited [Ihram], and upon him is another Hajj in the coming [year]). This is if he did not stipulate. But if he stipulated, then there is nothing upon him at all. With the note that the repetition is upon him even if he had performed the obligatory Hajj or the Hajj of Islam. So if he did not stipulate and was blocked and was not able to continue the Hajj, upon him is to repeat the Hajj in the coming [year] even if he had performed the obligation of Hajj. This is the answer to what you asked.

P12 - The Sheikh: ...Meaning you are asking about the Hadith: (They do not perform Ruqyah nor seek Ruqyah). Here is a question I will cast upon you with its answer, if Allah wills, after I deliver a brief word about a manner from the manners of gatherings which people today, especially them, let alone their common folk, have neglected. From these manners: is gathering, clustering, and closeness in the sitting place and not distancing in it. And this is from the wisdoms of the Shariah in many of its apparent rulings, for which explicit mention came in some authentic Hadiths. For instance, in Sahih Muslim, the Hadith of Jābir ibn Samurah—as I recall: That the Prophet ﷺ entered the mosque one day and saw them separated in circles, circles. So he said to them: (Why do I see you in separate groups [Izin]?)

P12a - Meaning: separated. And more important than this is what Imam Aḥmad narrates in his book Al-Musnad with a strong chain of narration on the authority of Abū Tha'labah al-Khushanī, may Allah be pleased with him, who said: We used to, if we traveled with the Prophet ﷺ and encamped, we would disperse in the mountain passes and the valleys. So we traveled one day and encamped as we used to encamp. So he, upon him be blessings and peace, said to them: (Indeed, your dispersing in these mountain passes and valleys is only from the work of Satan). He said: So we were, after that, if we encamped in a place, we would gather together such that if we sat on a carpet it would contain us. So (what) is your opinion while you are sitting here on a leveled, easy surface? So this separation is not from the Sunnah of Islam. Therefore, the more the circle is compact, the more it is encompassed by the mercy of Allah, Mighty and Majestic, and His bounty. And many people are ignorant that there is a very strong connection between the outer appearance of the human and his inner self. And this strong connection is among what many Hadiths of the Messenger ﷺ were available in indicating. Perhaps you know the phrase mentioned in many books "The apparent is the title of the inner." And this is what the poet pointed to in the past when he said:
Whatever character is in a man * Even if he thinks it hidden from people, it will be known.

P12b - So there must be a connection between the apparent and the inner. Therefore, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ took care with extreme care in rectifying the outer appearances of the Muslims in addition to their inner selves. For he ﷺ, just as he came with rectifying the hearts and the inner selves, likewise he came with rectifying the bodies and the outer appearances together. So the matter is not only as many people say: "The consideration is what is in the heart." Yes, the consideration is what is in the heart, but that does not necessitate lack of care for the apparent. For this reason, upon him be blessings and peace, said when he saw that man or heard that man saying—while the Messenger ﷺ was admonishing the people to obey Allah and follow His Book—that man stood to say to him: "What Allah wills and you will, O Messenger of Allah." So he ﷺ became angry with a severe anger, and said: (Say: What Allah wills alone). This is an apparent utterance; it appeared from the tongue of that Companion as an error from him. But this apparent is definitely contrary to his inner self, because his inner self was filled with faith in Allah and His Messenger ﷺ. But when he erred in the wording, the Messenger ﷺ did not stay silent about him; rather he corrected his phrase for him and said to him: (Say: What Allah wills alone). The Messenger of Allah ﷺ knows with certainty that this man did not intend what his wording indicated. His wording indicated that he made the Messenger a partner with Allah in His Will, Blessed and Exalted. But this Companion knows that the Will of Allah, Blessed and Exalted, is before everything and above everything, because he reads in the Noble Quran: "And you do not will except that Allah wills - Lord of the worlds." And no one thinks that this Companion is ignorant of this fact. But his tongue caused him to err. However, the Messenger ﷺ corrected him and guided him to what to say. He said to him: (Say: What Allah wills alone). And in another narration: (What Allah wills, then you will). And the Hadiths in this regard are many, and I am not now in the position of clarifying them, because it is a word about gathering in the assembly and not separating in it. But before I end it, I see myself compelled to remind of another Hadith only, due to what it contains of splendor in the concern of the Messenger, Allah's blessings and peace be upon him, in rectifying the expressions of people and their outer appearances. That is his statement ﷺ: (Let not one of you say: My soul has become wicked [Khabuthat]), (Let not one of you say: My soul has become wicked [Khabuthat], but rather: It has become upset [Laqisat]). What is the meaning of: (Laqisat)?

P12c - In the language it equals: (Khabuthat). (Laqisat) linguistically means: (Khabuthat). But the word: The Wicked (Khabithah), is wicked. So the Messenger ﷺ did not want the Muslim to utter it when he finds in himself something of this wickedness using the word: (Al-Khubth). Rather he diverted him from it to the word: (Laqisa). And this word, naturally, and you are Arabs, you do not know it, but the Master of the Arabs and non-Arabs is the one who taught it to you and said: (Let not one of you say: My soul has become wicked [Khabuthat], but rather: It has become upset [Laqisat]). This is regarding the politeness of the Muslim with himself, because he is a Muslim. So what is your thought regarding politeness with Allah and with His Prophet, upon him be blessings and peace?! So it is more worthy that the Muslim be polite with Allah then with His Messenger ﷺ, so he does not bring a phrase that might touch the station of Prophethood or the station of the Message. Just now, and the questioner should notice this, a questioner asked me between me and him, perhaps he said: Is it legislated or is it permissible for the hearer of the Adhan to say...

P14 - The Questioner: ...while they are alive. So what is the ruling of the legislation on that?
The Sheikh: If the intent of the distribution is the gift (Hibah) and the giving, then this has its ruling. And if the intent by it is dividing the inheritance before the arrival of its time, then this has another ruling. Then for each of the two rulings is a division that opposes the division of the other ruling. If the father wants, if he divides his wealth, to gift what he has of wealth to his children, then here comes his statement ﷺ: (Be just between your children). So he must make them equal here between the male and the female. As for if the intent is the division of inheritance, then this is premature firstly. Then, it might create dispute and conflict between the children due to the hastening of the execution of the ruling, and this ruling whose time has not come yet, because inheritance is only realized by the death of the one being inherited from.

P15 - The Questioner: Is the Prophet ﷺ visiting the graveyard at night specific to him, upon him be blessings and peace?
The Sheikh: No, it is not specific to him.

P16 - The Questioner: If Al-Ḥākim says in his Mustadrak: "This is a Hadith upon the condition of Al-Bukhārī" and he did not extract it, and Al-Dhahabī affirmed him on that, or Al-Dhahabī said about the Hadith that it is authentic; then is such a Hadith relied upon then? And is it used as proof just as any Hadith in the Two Sahihs is used as proof?
The Sheikh: Here the answer differs regarding the general people, and regarding some of the specific people. And by this "some" I mean: The scholars of Hadith. So regarding the general people, their duty, as we began in the word of this session, is to ask the people of knowledge. And without a doubt, Al-Ḥākim is from the people of knowledge of Hadith regarding authentication and weakening, especially if we measure him against those who have no knowledge. I do not mean the common folk, rather the specific ones (elite) of the end of time who do not study the science of Hadith. So it is obligatory that they refer to him, and that they look: What is his position on the Hadith? If he authenticated it, they follow him, unless the error of Al-Ḥākim becomes clear by the judgment of another who is more knowledgeable in the science of Hadith than him. So it is foremost and more worthy if Al-Ḥākim authenticated a Hadith and Al-Dhahabī agreed with him on it, then upon the general Muslims is to follow that. Unless it becomes clear to them by transmission from a scholar that Al-Ḥākim hallucinated (Wahim), and Al-Dhahabī also followed him in his hallucination; then at that point one returns from following him or following the two of them to following the correctness which became clear to him from other than them. As for the specific scholars of Hadith, then due to what they have been given of knowledge of the biographies of the narrators of Hadiths firstly, and what they have been given of the knowledge of the terminology of Hadith secondly, these ones—it is not obligatory upon them to follow Al-Ḥākim, nor even Al-Dhahabī. Because it becomes clear to them in many instances that much hallucination and error occurred in their authentication. In summary, just as it is obligatory on the general Muslims...
[Cut in the tape],
In one case, when the error of that jurist (Faqih) or the error of that Muhaddith becomes clear to them, then the error is not permissible to be followed.

P17 - The Questioner: In the same chapter, Professor, how is the purification (Tasfiyah) done? And what is considered a Hadith according to some Muhaddithin is considered a Good (Hasan) Hadith according to others, and what is considered bad according to some of them, is considered Good or Weak according to others?
The Sheikh: This, and no offense, is a trait we know from Akhzam (a familiar argument). The purification, we mean what is possible of it. The weak and fabricated Hadiths spread in the books—which we mentioned—from the books of Tafsir, Hadith, behavior (Suluk), morals, and the like are more than can be counted by the hundreds, rather by the thousands. So I am a single person; the number of weak and fabricated Hadiths with me has reached up to now nearly above six thousand weak Hadiths. I alone. So what do you imagine if there was abundance and multitude in the Islamic world of people of knowledge specialized [in this]? They would excavate the likes of these Hadiths from the bellies of the books, many, very many forms. So why do we come to some Hadiths in which some scholars of Hadith differed, as some say: "There are Fiqh rulings also in which some scholars differed." So we say: There are issues which have been established to the researchers in Fiqh that they are an error opposing the Book and the Sunnah, so they must be purified and removed from the path of the Jurists. Likewise, there are Hadiths agreed upon regarding their weakness, rather regarding their fabrication, so they must be removed from the bellies of the books and from the minds of the students of knowledge as well as the scholars. There remain without a doubt some Fiqh issues, and some Hadiths that are a place of disagreement. The fact that something of that remains does not justify asking such a question. Because we do not believe contrary to what spreads by some of the biased or ignorant ones that we want to unite all the Madhhabs (schools of thought), and make the four Madhhabs one Madhhab. We do not say [this]; we are from the most knowledgeable of people, we are the most knowledgeable of people that this is impossible. It is impossible to gather people on one Madhhab. It is impossible to gather people on one thought. But it is not impossible to bring people closer, especially the Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jama'ah. Bringing them closer is possible—and this is a reality and witnessed. For those who study the Fiqh which is called today "Comparative Fiqh"—even if this study in the universities is still superficial, because the doctor specialized in Shariah and Fiqh presents the issue and the sayings said regarding it and the evidences of all of them, then he leaves the students confused. He does not know what is the correct one from these sayings because he presented their evidences. There might be a general verse and a detailed Hadith, so he does not say this Hadith specifies the verse. There might be a Madhhab inferring with an authentic Hadith and another with a weak Hadith, so he does not turn to distinguishing the authentic from the weak, and so on. So he leaves what?

P17a - The students confused. Therefore I say: This Comparative Fiqh today is taught a superficial study. Those who study a complete study such that—as they say today also: they put the dots on the letters (clarify details), they say: This one's evidence is such, and this one's evidence is such, and this one's evidence is [such], and the preponderant view (Rajih) is such and such, for the reason of such and such. These know that those who tread this Fiqh methodology—and it is what is called Comparative Fiqh—that it brings the Muslims closer. And these are examples present between our hands today. Who from the students of knowledge does not hear of Imam al-Shawkānī? Who from the students of knowledge does not hear of al-Ṣan'ānī? Who from the people of knowledge does not hear of Ṣāliḥ al-Muqbilī? The author of "Al-'Ilm Al-Shamikh fi Ithar Al-Haqq 'ala Al-Aba' wal-Mashayikh" (The Lofty Knowledge in Preferring the Truth over the Fathers and Sheikhs). Who does not hear of these? No one. These, their origin is Zaydiyyah, Zaydis. They are not Hanafi, nor Shafi'i, nor Maliki, nor Hanbali. Meaning in the expression of these four Madhhabs, those Zaydis are not from Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jama'ah. But when they trod this path which we invite all Muslims to tread so that they come closer and love one another and do not distance themselves nor hate one another; so then was realized in them what was realized in these Imams whom we mentioned. Whereby they became with us; they became Sunnis. They started refuting the Zaydis because they oppose the Sunnah. So then, this methodology reconciles and does not divide. As for every human remaining on his Madhhab, then he is the one who divides and does not unite.

P18 - The Questioner: Is it permissible that I perform Umrah twice in one trip while I am from Jordan? So the first time from Abyār 'Alī and the second time from Al-Tan'īm, like: 'Ā'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her? If it is not permissible, then is it permissible on behalf of his deceased father or on behalf of his mother? And may Allah reward you with good.
The Sheikh: The one who wants to repeat the Umrah should return to the Miqat (boundary) from which he assumed Ihram. And whether that is on behalf of himself or on behalf of his parents. As for assuming Ihram from Al-Tan'īm, where the Lady 'Ā'ishah assumed Ihram, this is a ruling specific to 'Ā'ishah and whoever is like her. And I express this Umrah from Al-Tan'īm as "The Umrah of the Menstruating Woman". That is because 'Ā'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, when she went out with the Prophet ﷺ as a pilgrim in the Farewell Hajj, and she had assumed Ihram for Umrah, when she arrived at a place close to Makkah known as "Sarif", the Messenger ﷺ entered upon her and found her weeping. So he said to her: (What makes you weep? Have you got your menses [Anifisti]?) She said: Yes, O Messenger of Allah. He ﷺ said: (This is a matter Allah has written upon the daughters of Adam. So do what the pilgrim does other than that you do not circumambulate nor pray). So she did not circumambulate nor pray until she became pure in Arafat. Then she continued the rites of Hajj and performed the Hajj completely. When the Messenger ﷺ resolved to travel and return to Madinah, he entered upon her in her tent and found her also weeping. He said: (What is the matter with you?) She said: What is the matter with me? People return with a Hajj and an Umrah, and I return with a Hajj without an Umrah. That is because due to her menses, her Umrah flipped into Hajj, Hajj Ifrad (Single Hajj). So she is now weeping in regret over what she missed of the Umrah before the Hajj, while her co-wives like: Umm Salamah and others, returned with an Umrah and a Hajj. And for that reason she is weeping, saying: "Why should I not weep? People return with a Hajj and an Umrah and I return with a Hajj." So the Messenger ﷺ felt pity for her, and ordered her brother 'Abd al-Raḥmān ibn Abī Bakr al-Ṣiddīq to let her ride behind him on the she-camel and to go out with her to Al-Tan'īm. So he did. And she returned and performed Umrah and her soul was pleased. Therefore we say: Whoever is afflicted by the likes of what afflicted her among the women, where she menstruated while she was a Mu'tamirah (performing Umrah) and cannot complete the Umrah, so her Umrah flips into Hajj; so she compensates what she missed with the same method which Allah legislated on the tongue of His Messenger for 'Ā'ishah. So this other menstruating woman goes out to Al-Tan'īm and brings forth the Umrah. As for the men, then they, and praise be to Allah, do not menstruate. So what do they have to do with the ruling of the menstruating woman?

P18a - And the evidence is that, as some scholars of Seerah (biography) and conditions of the Companions say: One hundred thousand of the Companions performed Hajj with the Messenger; no one among them brought forth an Umrah like the Umrah of 'Ā'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her. So if that were good, they would have preceded us to it. Therefore, the one who wants to perform Umrah returns to the Miqat and assumes Ihram from there, whether on behalf of himself or on behalf of his mother and his father. And with this amount is sufficiency, and praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds.
The Questioner: If you allow me...
The Sheikh: The time is 11?
