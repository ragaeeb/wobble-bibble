P1 - The Shaykh:
All praise is due to Allah; we praise Him and seek His help and His forgiveness, and we seek refuge in Allah from the evils of our souls and from the evil consequences of our deeds. Whom Allah guides none can misguide, and whom He leads astray none can guide. I bear witness that there is no god but Allah alone, without partner, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His servant and Messenger ﷺ. As for what follows:
The best of speech is the speech of Allah, and the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad ﷺ, and the worst of matters are its innovations; every innovation is a bidʿah, every bidʿah is misguidance, and every misguidance is in the Fire.

P1a - Perhaps the brothers present all know the implication of this ḥadīth and its like, which is established in the books of the sunnah and has an authentic isnād to the Prophet ﷺ, for example the ḥadīth of ʿĀʾishah: “Whoever innovates in our affair something that is not from it, it is rejected,” and the ḥadīth of al-ʿArbaḍ b. Sāriyah, may Allah be pleased with him, who said: “The Messenger of Allah ﷺ admonished us with an admonition that made the hearts tremble and the eyes overflow; we said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, advise us.’ He said: ‘I advise you to fear Allah, to listen and obey; and if a slave of Ethiopian origin is made leader over you, and if any of you lives long he will see great differences; so adhere to my sunnah and the sunnah of the rightly-guided caliphs who come after me, hold to them with your molar teeth, and beware of the innovations of matters; every innovation is a bidʿah, and every bidʿah is misguidance.’” These ḥadīths confirm what I think you understand and believe: that innovation in the dīn is wholly misguidance — by which I mean innovation in the dīn, because the blameworthy innovation is specific to the dīn; as for matters of the world there are innovations some praiseworthy and some blameworthy, according to whether the innovation conflicts with sharʿ. If it conflicts with sharʿ it is blameworthy; if it does not conflict it is at least permissible. Among the best things said on this occasion is the statement of Ibn Taymīyah, may Allah have mercy on him, where he laid down a very important principle derived from those ḥadīths and supported by other texts indicating that the origin of things is permissibility; he said, may Allah have mercy on him: “The principle in the dīn is prohibition except by a text, and the principle in the world is permissibility except by a text.” He meant: every innovation in the dīn is forbidden, whereas an innovation in worldly matters is permitted unless it conflicts with a text, as we mentioned. It should be pointed out that his saying, the Prophet’s ﷺ warning “And beware of the innovations of matters,” means every act of worship introduced after the Prophet ﷺ, so it is misguidance even though many people imagine it good. And rightly said ʿAbd Allāh b. ʿUmar b. al-Khaṭṭāb, may Allah be pleased with him: “Every bidʿah is misguidance even if people see it as good,” because approval in the dīn means that the approver has assumed legislative authority alongside the Lord of the worlds, for none but Allah has the right to legislate what He wills. Hence al-Imām al-Shāfiʿī, may Allah have mercy on him, said: “Whoever approves has legislated,” for how does the approver know that what he approves is good? He only judged it by his reason and opinion and did not derive it from the Book of his Lord or the sunnah of His Prophet; whence does he know that it is good?
Therefore our stance toward every innovation in the dīn must be to refrain from it in light of the aforementioned authentic ḥadīths.

P2 - Questioner:
Some brothers sitting [here] hear of the Salafī daʿwah by hearsay and they read what opponents write about it, not what its followers and daʿīs write. I ask of your virtue, since you are among the scholars and daʿīs of Salafīyyah, to explain the position of Salafīyyah among the Islamic groups today.

P2a - The Shaykh:
I have answered such a question more than once, but since the question has been posed I must answer. I say a truthful word that no Muslim can dispute once the reality becomes clear:
First of all: the Salafī daʿwah — to what is it attributed? Salafīyyah is attributed to the salaf, so we must know who the salaf are when the term is used by the scholars of the Muslims: the salaf are the people of the three generations whom the Messenger of Allah ﷺ commended for goodness in the authentic mutawātir ḥadīth recorded in al-Ṣaḥīḥayn and elsewhere, from a group of the ṣaḥābah from the Prophet ﷺ that he said: “The best of people are my generation, then those who follow them, then those who follow them.” Those three generations are the salaf whom the Messenger ﷺ testified to as good. Thus Salafīyyah belongs to these salaf, and the Salafīs belong to these. Once we understand the meaning of the salaf and Salafīyyah, I say two things:
The first: this affiliation is not an affiliation to a person or persons, as are the affiliations of other groups present today in the Islamic world; it is not an affiliation to a person nor to dozens of people, but rather this affiliation is an affiliation to infallibility (al-ʿiṣmah), because the righteous salaf could not possibly unite on error, unlike the later generations; the later generations do not receive praise in the sharʿ, rather censure is mentioned of their majorities, as in the complete hadith previously where he ﷺ said: “Then there will come after them peoples who will testify but will not be looked to as witnesses …” and in the remainder of the ḥadīth. He ﷺ also indicated in another ḥadīth praise for a group of Muslims and censure of their majorities in the sense of the ḥadīth where he ﷺ said: “A group of my ummah will continue to be on the truth; those who oppose them will not harm them until the command of Allah comes” or “until the Hour comes.” This ḥadīth confines praise in the later time to a group — a ṭāifah — which is the small jamaʿah; the word ṭāifah in the language can apply to the individual and above. So if we know this meaning in Salafīyyah and that it belongs to the group of the righteous salaf who are the infallible reference insofar as a Muslim adheres to what those righteous salaf were upon, then comes the second point I referred to earlier, namely: every Muslim then, knowing this affiliation and what it signifies of infallibility, cannot — I do not say he cannot disavow it — it is impossible for him except to be a Salafī, because we have understood that affiliation to Salafīyyah means affiliation to infallibility; where do we derive this infallibility?

P2b - We derive it from a ḥadīth that some of the later generations misuse against the truth when they appeal to majority rule — that is, to the position of the masses of the later generations — when they bring the Prophet’s saying: “My ummah will not agree upon error.” It is not correct to apply that ḥadīth to the later generations today given their fundamental disagreements; “My ummah will not agree upon error” cannot be applied to the reality of Muslims today and every student of this bad reality knows that. Added to that are the authentic ḥadīths that delineate what occurred among the Jews and Christians before us and what will occur among the Muslims after the Messenger ﷺ in terms of fragmentation. He ﷺ said: “The Jews split into seventy-one sects and the Christians into seventy-two sects, and my ummah will split into seventy-three sects, all of them in the Fire except one.” They said: “Who are they, O Messenger of Allah?” He said: “They are the jamaʿah.” This jamaʿah is the jamaʿah of the Messenger ﷺ — those to whom the previous ḥadīth (that my ummah will not agree upon error) can be decisively applied: namely the Companions whom the Messenger ﷺ adjudged to be the saved party, and whoever follows their way and proceeds along it. These righteous salaf are those from whom Allah in the Qurʾān warned against deviating and following a way other than theirs in His saying, “And whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him and follows other than the way of the believers We will turn him over to what he has turned to and will burn him in Hell — and wretched is the destination.” I have often drawn our brothers’ attention on many occasions to the wisdom of the conjoining by Allah of the phrase “and follows other than the way of the believers” to opposing the Messenger. What is the wisdom of that? Had the verse been without this clause, i.e., “And whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him We will turn him over …” it would have sufficed as a warning and rebuke of one who opposes the Messenger ﷺ and as a judgment on his evil outcome. The verse is not thus; rather it added the phrase “and follows other than the way of the believers” — is that without purpose?

P2c - Far be it from the speech of Allah to be purposeless — i.e., whoever follows other than the way of the Companions, who in our preceding expression are the guardians of correctness and they are the jamaʿah that the Messenger ﷺ testified to as the saved party, then it is not permissible for anyone who desires to escape the punishment of Allah on the Day of Resurrection to oppose their way. Hence Allah said, “And whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him and follows other than the way of the believers We will turn him over to what he has turned to and will burn him in Hell — and wretched is the destination.”
Thus Muslims today in the latter times must know two matters:

P2d - First: who are the Muslims mentioned in this verse? And what is the wisdom of hearing the Qurʾān and the ḥadīths of the Messenger ﷺ directly from them, and why did they not have the merit merely of reading about the practical application by the Messenger ﷺ of the texts of the Book and the Sunnah? Among the wisdoms stated in the Sunnah is his saying: “Hearing and seeing is not like witnessing” (literally: “not all report is like witnessing”), and from this the poet began his line, “What the seer saw is not like what the hearer heard.” Thus those who did not witness the Messenger ﷺ are not like his Companions who heard from him directly and saw his actions; they apprehended it better than those who only heard. There is a contemporary phrase some Islamic preachers have coined which is very good in expression, but more admirable would be to make it a realized truth: they say in their lectures and admonitions that Islam must be made a reality walking on the earth — a fine phrase — but if we do not understand Islam in the light of the understanding of the righteous salaf as we say, we cannot realize that beautiful poetic phrase of making Islam a lived reality on the earth. Those who were able to do that were the Companions for the two reasons mentioned: they heard the speech from him directly and apprehended it better, and there are matters requiring practical clarification which they saw the Messenger ﷺ exemplify. I give a very clear example: there are verses in the Qurʾān that a Muslim cannot understand except by knowing the Sunnah that explicates the Qurʾān, as Allah said, “And We have revealed to you the Reminder that you may make clear to the people what has been sent down to them.” For example His saying, “As for the male thief and the female thief, cut off their hands” — now bring the contemporary Sibawayh in Arabic grammar and let him interpret this noble verse: who is “the thief”? Linguistically one cannot determine who the thief is; and “the hand” — what is it? The Sibawayh of the latter age cannot give the answer to these two questions: who is the thief deserving of hand-cutting, and what is the hand that ought to be cut for that thief?

P2e - Linguistically: if one steals an egg he is a thief, and the hand in this instance whether cut here or here or anywhere is a hand. But the answer comes when the previous verse was mentioned: “And We have revealed to you the Reminder that you may make clear to the people what has been sent down to them.” The answer is in the clarification; there is clarification from the Messenger ﷺ for the Qurʾān, and this clarification the Messenger ﷺ applied in practice in this verse as an example and in many other verses, and there are many. For whoever reads in the science of uṣūl one reads about general and specific, unrestricted and restricted, abrogating and abrogated, ambiguous words under which dozens of texts fall, if not hundreds — general texts explicated by the Sunnah. I do not wish to lengthen this so that we can answer the rest of the questions.

P3 - Questioner:
If the parents refuse to let their daughter visit a sister in Allah whom she longs for and they always refuse that visit, is it permissible in Islām for her to go to visit without informing them? Or should she tell them something untrue?
The Shaykh:
It is not permissible for her to visit without the permission of her parents, nor is it permissible for her to lie to them. Rather she must convince her parents that this visit is one the Wise Lawgiver commands, and if they are convinced then so be it; if they are not convinced then it is not permissible for the daughter — especially if she claims to be committed to the sharʿ — to disobey her parents in such a visit.
Questioner:
My teacher, does the same apply to lessons? For example, we are in a lesson and there is admonition about something?
The Shaykh:
The same thing: permission is necessary.

P4 - Questioner:
What is the ruling concerning wearing the khimār — covering the face and the hands — at present? And if a girl feels fitnah and chooses to wear it but the parents, and especially the mother, refuse, what should she do?
The Shaykh:
If the refusal is limited to the face and the hands, then obedience to the parents is required in that matter. But if the refusal includes more than that, then there is no obedience to a created being in disobedience to the Creator. That is: a woman must cover all of her body except the face and the hands; covering those two is not obligatory but is recommended. If the parents do not assent to their daughter covering her face and hands, there is no harm in obeying them and there is no sin in that; unlike where they desire her to uncover other than the face and hands — in that case there is no obedience to them, because that would be disobedience.

P5 - The Shaykh:
An ishārib (rectangular scarf) is not sufficient; it must be a khimār that covers the entire head and the nape; the ishārib is not sābiġ and its coverage is not sufficient.
Questioner:
Does the satar include the shoulders as well, our teacher?
The Shaykh:
Yes — that is the khimār. The description of the khimār is that it be loose and wide and cover the head and the shoulders. When we say it covers the nape, if it covers the nape it covers the shoulders because it is wide. As for the ishārib we often see women with some of the neck exposed because of the ishārib, whereas the khimār covers the neck and the shoulders together. Allah commanded that, He said, “And let them draw their khumur over their bosoms.” As for the ishārib, this is one of what is called today half-measures, and there is no room in Islām for half-measures.

Questioner:
Teacher, many now among some of the committed [men and women] in the dīn and in their dress think that the khimār is the face-covering?
The Shaykh:
This is ignorance of the language. Al-khimār is the head covering; hence a man khamara, that is, he put the khimār on his head, and likewise the woman. Thus He said, “And let them draw their khumur over their bosoms.” If the khimār covered the face, He would not say “draw” (yaḍribna) meaning tighten it; rather it would be a loose falling garment. This is ignorance of the language.

P6 - Questioner:
If a woman wears high heels in her shoe, is that permissible? What is the ruling?
The Shaykh:
It is not permissible to imitate the kuffār or the immoral. This practice originally came from the Jewish women who before Islām, if one of them wished to attend the gathering in which her lover would be, she would wear a kind of high clog so that she would appear taller and be seen; then over time this became the heel shoe. As for a shoe that changes a woman’s gait making her sway right and left — the immoral foreign women invented this kind of shoe — a committed Muslim woman should not wear a high-heeled shoe, especially since often it is a cause of her harm and causing her to fall on another’s head if she stumbles on the way for the smallest reason.

P7 - Questioner:
Is it permissible to speak ill of (istighābah) the disbeliever and the mushrikah? Is it permissible to curse them?
The Shaykh:
All of that is permissible, because the disbeliever has no sanctity, except if from that results a greater harm. For example: if one curses the disbeliever to his face or back and he is informed of it, he may then insult the Muslim and insult his religion and his Prophet and so on; then in that case it is forbidden for the Muslim to curse the mushrik.

P8 - Questioner:
In the verse “No one may touch it except the purifiers” — is the intended meaning “the purifiers” the believers or those who have performed wuduʾ? And what is the ruling on taking the Qurʾān to the unbelieving lands?
The Shaykh:
The intended meaning of the verse is neither of those two; rather the reference is to the angels, and it is a statement from Allah about the angels, not about this copy of the Qurʾān; rather it is that which is in the Preserved Tablet. This mushaf which is in the Preserved Tablet “no one may touch it except the purifiers” — that is the angels nearest to Allah. This is an informative statement, not an injunctive one; that is, it does not issue a sharʿī ruling. Allah speaks of the reality that the Qurʾān in the Book (al-lawḥ al-maḥfūẓ) — this does not mean our mushaf in people’s hands; this is touched by the righteous and the wicked, the believer and the disbeliever. Allah does not mean by this verse human beings generally whether righteous or wicked; rather, as we said, He means the angels nearest to Him.
