Translating Arabic text and format rules
I need to transliterate all Arabic texts but provide translations in English. For Quran verses in Arabic, I translate the meaning rather than paraphrase. Phrases like "ومن يشاقق الرسول ...” will be translated. When "السائل" or "الشيخ" appears, I’ll format these responses with a new line labeled as "Questioner:" and "The Shaykh:". Common terms like "بدعة" will use transliteration initially, then stick to English for later mentions.

Translating terms while following format rules
For segment P1, I’ll use "bidʿah (innovation)" the first time "بدعة" appears, and after that, simplify to just "innovation" for the rest of the segment. Similarly, I’ll translate "ḍalālah (misguidance)" for the first mention of "ضلالة", then use "misguidance" afterwards. I’ll do the same for plural and other forms. "Sunnah" will also be translated as "Prophetic practice" when referred to in the segment.

Translating common nouns and locked terms accurately
For each segment, I’ll use paired translation for the first occurrence. For "السنة," it will be "sunnah (Prophetic practice)" the first time, then just "Prophetic practice" after that. "كتب السنة" should be "books of the Sunnah" for accuracy. For terms like "الإسناد," I’ll use "isnād (chain of narration)" on first mention, continuing with "isnād" afterward. I’ll keep "ṣaḥīḥ (authentic)" as the first occurrence for accurate translation.

Translating locked terms and following format rules
For "ṣaḥīḥ," the first occurrence will be "ṣaḥīḥ (authentic)" in a segment, and later just "authentic." Common terms like "الجنب" will be transliterated as "junub (in major ritual impurity)." For other terms like "الإحصار" and "الميقات," I’ll use "iḥṣār (restriction)" and "mīqāt (fixed boundary)" respectively. I’ll avoid correcting typos, as instructed, and Tuck everything into the proper translation format.

Translating colloquial words, names, and places
For colloquial words like "هدول," I’ll translate them literally as "these" or "those." Segment numbering should be kept as provided, even with missing P13. For bracketed notes like "[وبداية الجواب مبتورة]," I’ll translate them directly as "[And the beginning of the answer is truncated]." Place names and Arabic names need to be rendered with correct transliteration, such as "Makkah" for مكة and "al-Madīnah" for المدينة. Titles should be translated, so "حجة الوداع" will be "Ḥijjat al-Wadāʿ (Farewell Pilgrimage)."

Translating event names, sects, and formatting
When dealing with Arabic script that is not a person, place, or title, it may be an event name. For example, "Ḥijjat al-Wadāʿ" would be transliterated, without parentheses. Sect names like "Salafiyyah" and "Ahl al-Sunnah wa-al-Jamāʿah" should also be transliterated. I’ll ensure rules are followed for quotes and month names, and maintain formatting, like breaking lines for utterances.

Handling Q&A formatting and salutations
For segments like P2, I’ll follow the rule to start with the segment ID. For the Q&A labels like "The Shaykh:", I'll place a newline where required, but no extra segment IDs should be added. Regarding salutations, I'll replace any instance of "صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم" with ﷺ in translation, but "عليه السلام" won't be converted into ﷺ.

Handling salutations in translation
For salutations like "عليه السلام" or "عليه الصلاة والسلام," I’ll translate these as "peace be upon him" to stay consistent with the translation guidelines. However, the instruction to use ﷺ applies strictly to the Prophet's name only, so I’ll reserve ﷺ for those specific occasions and avoid using it for other phrases. For "رضي الله تعالى عنه," I’ll translate it as "may Allah be pleased with him," as that’s appropriate for the companions.

Translating Arabic terms and names correctly
For names like "عبد الله" I’ll ensure transliteration follows ALA-LC guidelines, so "ʿAbd Allāh" is used. For connectors like "ابن," I’ll use "b." in the middle of chains. Similarly for titles, "Shaykh al-Islām Ibn Taymiyyah" is correct. Arabic terms like "المصحف" will have their proper translation first, followed by simpler terms. For colloquial expressions and segments like poetry, I'll translate exactly, especially when there's a truncation or clarification needed in a question.

Handling translation of segments with ellipsis and parentheses
For ellipsis, I'll translate it as "..." as required, without adding anything extra. The user allows translation of polemical terms like "kuffār," so I’ll proceed with that thoughtfully. For segment breaks, I'll keep them intact without restructuring. Parentheses are tricky but allowed only for technical terms, dates, or book codes, so I'll avoid them otherwise, even if the source contains parentheses around hadith quotes.

Handling parenthesis and term translation rules
I need to keep the rule about not using parentheses unless specified, so I’ll replace any parentheses used for quoting hadith with quotation marks. Book titles will be transliterated as ALA-LC without parentheses. For words like "khabuthat" or "laqisat," as they are explained, I’ll present them as term pairs: khabuthat (became foul). Diacritics are needed in these cases, so I'll make sure to include those. Similarly, colloquial phrases will be translated directly.

Working through translation guidelines and term use
I need to be mindful of the rules on translation, like using "term pair" for technical terms during their first occurrence, such as "fiqh (jurisprudence)," "daʿwah (call)," and "salām (peace)." For common nouns, like "khimār (head-cover)," I should ensure consistency but avoid using transliterations for non-technical terms. I’ll translate terms like "ghībah (backbiting)" and abbreviate Arabic book names correctly using ALA-LC. For specific uses like "Shaykh" and "Allah," I'll be careful with locked glossary terms.
