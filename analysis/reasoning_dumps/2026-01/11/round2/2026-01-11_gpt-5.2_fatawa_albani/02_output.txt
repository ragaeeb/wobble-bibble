P1 - The Shaykh: Indeed, all praise is for Allah; we praise Him, seek His help, and seek His forgiveness. We seek refuge in Allah from the evils of our own selves and from the evil consequences of our deeds. Whomever Allah guides, none can lead astray; and whomever He leads astray, none can guide. I bear witness that there is no deity except Allah alone, with no partner, and I bear witness that Muḥammad is His servant and His Messenger. To proceed:
Indeed, the best speech is the speech of Allah, and the best guidance is the guidance of Muḥammad ﷺ. The worst of matters are their newly-introduced ones, and every newly-introduced matter is bidʿah (innovation), and every innovation is ḍalālah (misguidance), and every misguidance is in the Fire.

P1a - Perhaps all the brothers present know, from the indication of this ḥadīth (hadith) and the like of it, from what is established in the books of sunnah (Prophetic practice) and with an authentic isnād (chain of narration) to the Prophet ﷺ, such as the ḥadīth of ʿĀʾishah: “Whoever introduces into this affair of ours what is not from it, then it is rejected,” and the ḥadīth of al-ʿIrbāḍ b. Sāriyah, may Allah Most High be pleased with him, who said: “Messenger of Allah ﷺ admonished us with an admonition from which the hearts trembled and the eyes shed tears, so we said: O Messenger of Allah, advise us.” He said: “I advise you to have taqwā (Godfearingness) of Allah, and to hear and obey, even if an Abyssinian slave is put in authority over you. Indeed, whoever among you lives will see much اختلاف (disagreement). So adhere to my sunnah (Prophetic practice) and the sunnah of the rightly-guided, rightly-directed caliphs after me; cling to it with the molars, and beware the newly-introduced matters. Every newly-introduced matter is bidʿah (innovation), and every innovation is ḍalālah (misguidance).” These ḥadīths confirm what I suppose you understand and believe: that introducing innovations in dīn (religion), all of it, is misguidance. And I mean in religion, because the blameworthy innovation is specific to religion. As for worldly matters, some of it is praiseworthy and some of it is blameworthy, according to this newly-introduced thing: if it conflicts with the Sharʿ (revealed law) then it is blameworthy, and if it does not conflict with the Sharʿ then it is, at the least, permissible. And among the best things transmitted on this occasion is the statement of Shaykh al-Islām Ibn Taymiyyah, may Allah have mercy on him, for he set down a very important principle that he derived from those ḥadīths plus other texts indicating that the الأصل (default) in things is permissibility, and this is a uṣūlī (principle-of-legal-theory) principle. He, may Allah have mercy on him, said: “The default in religion is prohibition except with a text, and the default in worldly matters is permissibility except with a text.” Meaning: every newly-introduced thing in religion is forbidden; as for the newly-introduced thing in the world, it is permitted unless it conflicts with a text, as we mentioned. Then from what should be pointed out is that his ﷺ statement: “Beware the newly-introduced matters,” only means every act of worship introduced after the Prophet ﷺ, so it is misguidance, even if in the view of many people they reckon it to be good. And ʿAbd Allāh b. ʿUmar b. al-Khaṭṭāb, may Allah be pleased with him, spoke truthfully when he said: “Every bidʿah (innovation) is ḍalālah (misguidance) even if the people see it as good.” That is because considering something good in religion means that this one who deems it good has paired himself with the Lord of the worlds, for none besides Him has the right to legislate except what Allah, Mighty and Majestic, wills. For this reason, Imām al-Shāfiʿī, may Allah have mercy on him, said: Whoever deems something good has legislated, because what makes this one who deems it good know that this which he deemed good, by his reason and thinking only, and he did not take that from the Book of his Lord or from the sunnah of his Prophet—how can he know that this is a good matter?!
Therefore, our stance, all of us, toward every newly-introduced matter in religion must be to refrain from it, by what has preceded of authentic ḥadīths (hadiths).

P2 - Questioner: Some of the brothers sitting hear about the Salafiyyah call only by hearing, and they read about it what is written by its opponents, not by its followers and its callers. So what is hoped from your eminence, and you are among the scholars of Salafiyyah and its callers, is an explanation of the position of Salafiyyah among the Islamic groups today.
The Shaykh: I have answered the like of this question more than once, but an answer is necessary since a question has been posed. So I say: a word of truth that no Muslim can dispute after the truth becomes clear to him:

P2a - First of that: the Salafiyyah call—attributed to what? Salafiyyah is an attribution to the salaf (early forebears), so we must know who the salaf are when, among the scholars of the Muslims, “salaf” is used, and thus this attribution is understood, and what weight it carries in its meaning and its indication. The salaf: they are the people of the three centuries for whom Messenger of Allah ﷺ testified to goodness in the authentic, mutawātir (mass-transmitted) ḥadīth (hadith) brought out in the Ṣaḥīḥayn and elsewhere, from a group of the Companions, from the Prophet ﷺ, that he said: “The best of people are my century, then those after them, then those after them.” These three centuries that the Messenger ﷺ testified to goodness—Salafiyyah belongs to this salaf, and the Salafīs belong to these salaf. If we know the meaning of the salaf and Salafiyyah, then I say two matters:
The first matter: that this attribution is not an attribution to a person or persons, as are the attributions of other groups present today on the Islamic earth. This is not an attribution to a person nor to dozens of persons; rather, this attribution is an attribution to ʿiṣmah (infallibility). That is because the righteous salaf are impossible to unite upon misguidance, unlike the khalaf (later generations). For the khalaf have not come in the Sharʿ with praise for them; rather, blame has come for their multitudes, and that is in the completion of the previous ḥadīth (hadith), where he ﷺ said: “Then after them will come people who will testify and will not be asked to testify …” to the end of the ḥadīth. Likewise, he ﷺ indicated that in another ḥadīth in which there is praise for a group of the Muslims and blame for their multitudes, by the import of the ḥadīth, where he ﷺ said: “A ṭāʾifah (group) from my ummah will not cease to be manifest upon the truth; those who oppose them will not harm them until the command of Allah comes,” or “until the Hour is established.” This ḥadīth singled out praise at the end of time for a ṭāʾifah, and ṭāʾifah is the small group; in the language it is applied to one person and above.
So if we know this meaning in Salafiyyah, and that it belongs to the جماعت (group) of the righteous salaf, and that they are the ʿiṣmah (infallibility) when the Muslim holds to what these righteous salaf were upon, then comes the second matter that I pointed to earlier, namely: that every Muslim, when he knows then this attribution and what it aims at of ʿiṣmah (infallibility), it becomes impossible for him after this knowledge and clarification that— I do not say: that— to disavow it; this is obvious. Rather, I say: it is impossible for him except to be Salafī, because we have understood that affiliating to Salafiyyah means affiliating to ʿiṣmah (infallibility). From where did we take this ʿiṣmah (infallibility)?

P2b - We take it from a ḥadīth (hadith) that some of the khalaf (later generations) use as evidence contrary to the truth: they use it as evidence for arguing for taking the majority—what the multitudes of the khalaf are upon—when they cite his ﷺ statement: “My ummah will not gather upon ḍalālah (misguidance).” It is not correct to apply this ḥadīth to the khalaf today, given what is between them of radical disagreements. “My ummah will not gather upon misguidance” cannot be applied to the reality of the Muslims today, and this is something known to every student of this bad reality. Added to that are the authentic ḥadīths (hadiths) that came clarifying what occurred among those before us of the Jews and Christians, and what will occur among the Muslims after the Messenger ﷺ of splitting, so he ﷺ said: “The Jews split into seventy-one sects, and the Christians into seventy-two sects, and my ummah will split into seventy-three sects; all of them are in the Fire except one.” They said: Who is it, O Messenger of Allah? He said: “It is al-jamāʿah.” This jamāʿah: it is the jamāʿah of the Messenger ﷺ; it is the one about which one can decisively apply the previous ḥadīth (hadith): “My ummah will not gather upon ḍalālah (misguidance),” that what is meant by this ḥadīth is the Companions whom the Messenger ﷺ ruled are the ناجية (saved) sect, and those who take their path and incline toward them. And these righteous salaf are the ones our Lord, Mighty and Majestic, warned us in the Qurʾān from opposing and from taking a path other than their path, in His, Mighty and Majestic, statement: “Whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him, and follows other than the path of the believers, We will turn him to what he has turned to, and We will burn him in Jahannam, and an evil destination it is.” I have drawn the attention of our brothers on many occasions to the wisdom of our Lord, Mighty and Majestic, joining in this verse His statement: “and follows other than the path of the believers” to opposing the Messenger. What is the wisdom of that? Even though if the verse were, with the deletion of this clause, as follows: “Whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him, We will turn him to what he has turned to, and We will burn him in Jahannam, and an evil destination it is,” it would have been sufficient in warning and rebuking the one who opposes the Messenger ﷺ, and judging him with his bad end. The verse was not like that; rather, it added to that His, Mighty and Majestic, statement: “and follows other than the path of the believers.” Is this in vain?!

P2c - Far be it for the speech of Allah, Mighty and Majestic, to be in vain—meaning: whoever follows a path other than the path of the Companions, who are the ʿiṣmah (infallibility) in our preceding expression, and they are the jamāʿah that the Messenger ﷺ testified is the saved sect; and whoever follows their path—these are the ones it is not permissible for one who wants salvation from the punishment of Allah on the Day of Resurrection to oppose their path. Therefore He, Exalted, said: “Whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him, and follows other than the path of the believers, We will turn him to what he has turned to, and We will burn him in Jahannam, and an evil destination it is.”
So upon the Muslims today at the end of time is to know two matters:

P2d - First: who are the Muslims mentioned in this verse? Then what is the wisdom of hearing the Qurʾān and the ḥadīths (hadiths) of the Messenger ﷺ from him directly, and then they had the virtue of seeing the Messenger ﷺ applying the texts of the Book and the sunnah (Prophetic practice) with a practical application. And from the wisdom that came stated in the sunnah is his ﷺ statement: “Information is not like seeing with one’s own eyes.” From it began, and from it the poet took his statement: “The one who sees is not like the one who hears.” So those who did not witness the Messenger ﷺ are not like his Companions who saw and heard speech from him directly, and saw from him a practical application. Today there is a contemporary phrase with which some Islamic callers have shone, and it is a very nice phrase, but nicer than it is to make it a real reality. They say in their lectures and admonitions and counsels that we must make Islam a reality walking upon the earth. Nice speech, but if we do not understand Islam in light of the understanding of the righteous salaf, as we say, we cannot realize this beautiful poetic speech: to make Islam a real reality walking upon the earth. Those who were able to do that were the Companions of the Messenger ﷺ for the two reasons mentioned earlier: they heard speech from him directly, so they comprehended it better than anyone comprehended, then in matters there that need practical clarification, they saw the Messenger ﷺ clarifying that to them by action. I will strike for you a very clear example: there are verses in the Qurʾān that a Muslim cannot understand unless he knows the sunnah that clarifies the Qurʾān, as He, Mighty and Majestic, said: “And We sent down to you the Reminder so that you may clarify to the people what has been sent down to them.” For example, His, Exalted, statement: “As for the male thief and the female thief, cut their hands.” Now bring us the Sībawayh of this time in the Arabic language, and let him explain this noble verse for us. “As for the thief”: who is he? Linguistically, he cannot specify the thief. And what is the hand? The Sībawayh of the end of time cannot give the answer to these two questions: who is the thief who deserves cutting of the hand, and what is the hand that should be cut for this thief?

P2e - Language: if the thief steals an egg, then he is a thief, and the hand, if it were cut here or here or in any place, it is a hand. But the answer is when he mentioned the previous verse: “And We sent down to you the Reminder so that you may clarify to the people what has been sent down to them.” The answer is in the clarification. There is clarification from the Messenger ﷺ of the Qurʾān, and he ﷺ applied this clarification by action in the case of this verse as an example, and in the case of other verses, and how many they are, because whoever reads in ʿilm al-uṣūl (legal theory) reads in ʿilm al-uṣūl that there is general and specific, and absolute and restricted, and abrogating and abrogated—compact terms under which dozens of texts enter, if we do not say hundreds of texts. General texts the sunnah brought, and I do not want to lengthen in this so that we can answer the rest of the questions.

P3 - Questioner: If the family refuses that their daughter visit a sister for her in Allah and she longs for her, and they always refuse this visit, does Islam permit her to go out to visit her without informing them of that? Or does she tell them something untrue?
The Shaykh: It is not permissible for her to visit her without the permission of her parents, just as it is not permissible for her to lie to them. Rather, she must convince the parents that this visit is commanded by the Wise Legislator. If they are convinced, then so be it; and if they are not convinced, then it is not permissible for the girl—especially if she claims that she is committed to the Sharʿ—to go out of obedience to her parents in such a visit.
Questioner: My teacher, with regard to—likewise the lessons, does that apply to that? We are in a lesson, for example, an admonition in something?
The Shaykh: The same thing: permission is necessary.

P4 - Questioner: What is the ruling on wearing the khimār (covering) of the face and the two hands at the present time? And if a girl feels temptation and chooses to wear it but the family refuses, especially the mother, then what does she do?
The Shaykh: If the refusal is limited to the face and the two hands, then obedience to the parents is required in that. But if the refusal includes more than that, then there is no obedience to a created being in disobedience to the Creator. Meaning: it is obligatory upon the woman to cover her entire body except the face and the two hands; covering them is not obligatory, but it is recommended. So if the father does not approve for his daughter to cover her face and her two hands, then there is no problem in obeying them, and there is no disobedience in that. Unlike if they want her to uncover other than the face and the two hands; then there is no obedience to them upon her, because that is disobedience.

P5 - The ishārib (scarf) is not sufficient; it must be a khimār (head-cover) such that it covers the whole head and the throat upper-chest area. The scarf is not ample, and its covering is not sufficient.
Questioner: Does the covering include the shoulders as well, our teacher?
The Shaykh: Yes, this is the khimār. The description of the khimār is that it is loose and wide; it covers the head and covers the shoulders. When we say it covers the throat upper-chest area, then when it covers that it covers the shoulders because it is wide. As for the scarf, we often see women with something of the neck showing because of the scarf, whereas the khimār covers the neck and the shoulders together. And Allah commanded that; He said: “Let them draw their headcovers over their bosoms.” As for this scarf, it is from the category— as they say today—of half solutions, and in Islam there are no half solutions.
Questioner: My teacher, many now, among some, meaning, those committed and those committed women in religion and in their clothing, believe that the khimār is a face-covering.
The Shaykh: This is ignorance of the language. The khimār is a head-cover. For that reason, the man khatamara, meaning: he puts the khimār on his head, and the woman likewise. Therefore He said: “Let them draw their headcovers over their bosoms.” If the khimār covered the face, He would not say “draw,” meaning: pull it tight; rather, in it there is sadl (letting it hang). This is ignorance of the language.

P6 - Questioner: If a woman wears a high heel in footwear, is that permissible for her? And what is the ruling?
The Shaykh: It is not permissible to imitate disbelieving women or immoral women. The origin of this is from Jewish women. In ancient times before Islam, if one of them wanted to attend the gathering in which her lover would be, then so that he would see her she would wear a kind of elevated clog, so she would become tall and be seen. Then with time this turned into the shoe with the high heel. As for this shoe that makes the woman—meaning—her walking change, leaning right and left, because of that the immoral disbelievers invented this type of shoe. So it is not fitting for the committed Muslim woman to wear a shoe with a high heel, especially since, in many cases, it is a cause of her being harmed and falling on the top of her head if she stumbles in the road for the slightest reason.

P7 - Questioner: Is it permissible to commit ghībah (backbiting) of the disbeliever and the polytheist woman? And is it permissible to insult them?
The Shaykh: All of that is permissible, because the disbeliever has no inviolability, unless a harm results from that. For example: if he insults the disbeliever to his face or behind his back, and that reaches him, then perhaps he will insult the Muslim and insult his religion and his Prophet, and so on. Then, in that case, insulting by the Muslim of the polytheist becomes forbidden.

P8 - Questioner: In the verse: “None touch it except the purified,” what is meant by “the purified”: the believers or those with wuḍūʾ (ablution)? And what is the ruling of not taking the Qurʾān to the disbelieving lands?
The Shaykh: What is meant by the verse is neither this nor that. Rather, what is meant is the angels. It is information from Allah, Mighty and Majestic, about the angels, and it is not this Qurʾān, but rather what is in al-lawḥ al-maḥfūẓ (the Preserved Tablet). This codex that is in the Preserved Tablet: “None touch it except the purified,” and they are the near angels. This is a declarative statement, not an imperative statement, meaning: issuing a legal ruling. Allah speaks about reality: that the Qurʾān, meaning what is in the concealed book, meaning the Preserved Tablet, this “none touch it except the purified,” and they are the near angels. As for the codex that is between our hands, then the righteous and the wicked touch it, and the believer and the disbeliever. So our Lord, Mighty and Majestic, does not mean by this verse human beings at all, whether righteous or wicked; rather, He means, as we said, the near angels.

P8a - As for traveling with the Qurʾān and the codex to the land of the enemy, it is not permissible unless it is secure that it will not be touched with harm and will not be humiliated. Then it is permissible when we are secure that the codex will not be humiliated; it is permissible to bring it into the land of the disbelievers so that perhaps they will be able to read it and study it.
