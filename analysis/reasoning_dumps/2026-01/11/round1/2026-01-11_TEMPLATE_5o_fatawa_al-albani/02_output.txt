P40 - al-Shaykh: But I mentioned to him that jihad fi sabīl Allah today is a farḍ ʿayn on all Muslims, but not only in Afghānistān, rather in many lands — I did not want, of course, to elaborate, I will shorten the speech — like Filasṭīn for example; but there are two realities that must be pointed out or reminded: I said to him:
First: jihad requires two things:
1 - a moral/spiritual readiness.
2 - and a material readiness.

P40a - As for the moral readiness: it is that we be truly Muslims so that we thereby deserve victory for Allah as He said: “If you help Allah He will help you,” whereas the material readiness: it is well known, and the Muslims today do not have material readiness, because all their weapons come to them from abroad and at exorbitant prices.
And the gist of the matter: I told him: jihad is not the jihad of individuals, jihad must be the jihad of Islamic governments preparing their peoples and equipping them with īmān and materiel, and this without doubt is not the reality today, unfortunately, and this example is before us: Filasṭīn, and I fear what I fear that Afghānistān may become a second Filasṭīn; therefore if you see there is readiness for jihad then fight, otherwise adhere to what you are doing of study.
One of those present: They say that Afghānistān is in the field of fighters and mujahidīn but here Filasṭīn is closed.
al-Shaykh: That is what he says; the issue is an open road issue, an issue of moral and material preparations.
First: the Afghans themselves should be Muslims, not atheists, should be — agreed among themselves, not divided.

P40b - Second: they should have readiness to manufacture weapons, not to beg for them, because unfortunately it is a pitiful matter — they live fighting by begging, and they do not obtain them; the guests who came to us some time ago from Miṣr, one Kuwaiti and one Saudi — were you present at the meeting? — they brought me magazines for the first time I distributed, magazines called Jihād fī Afghānistān.
One of those present: …
al-Shaykh: You brought him by mail, you brought those two people in?
One of those present: …
al-Shaykh: Did you meet with those shayūkh who were with me?
One of those present: …
al-Shaykh: The point: I read from them — I mean — something lamentable; they say: there are facts that most Arab countries do not supply them neither with men nor with materiel, then they are only two states: al-Suʿūdīyah and al-Bākistānīyah, and then they do not supply them with supplies, they go a month on mules and donkeys until they attack the Soviet-Russian post, they require precise written accounts, they only want so that the bread be obtained for them for so many million dollars per month, and they do not obtain it, how will these people fight, O people? These should first save themselves from natural death, not from death by Russian weapons; the Arab states sit and watch, and I, by God, said: a year or more ago that all this is foreign planning, that is: the supplies that come to them via the Americans via al-Suʿūdīyah and al-Bākistān are American supplies, so they supply them, that it will go only so far, only so far and this is to restore Filasṭīn again.
One of those present: There they fight the Russians and the Americans … and it is who fights the Russians, I went to Bākistān … here the Americans support inside the Russians from here.
al-Shaykh: And among the correspondents, he said: in Bākistān there are sixteen political parties, he said: only two parties support us, this Bākistān is an Islamic state — I mean — it contains (sixteen political parties that do not support the Afghans in their jihad except two parties!
A man in attendance: There have been many karāmāt.
al-Shaykh: That, sir, are broadcasts of this Dr. Darwīsh.
A man in attendance: This is a method to educate people’s emotions.
al-Shaykh: It is that.
Another man in attendance: …
al-Shaykh: I seek refuge in Allah, what did they bring?
A man in attendance: …
al-Shaykh: I seek refuge in Allah, but this is what the complacent negligent people say to justify their negligence.

P41 - Questioner: Our Shaykh, here Shaykh al-Islām, may Allah have mercy on him, says: As for the asking of a created being of another created being to fulfill his need or to supplicate for him, it was not commanded, and he adduces evidence for this statement …
al-Shaykh: And it was forbidden? It was not commanded, was it forbidden? Before you read to me, was it forbidden?
Questioner: He did not mention a prohibition, nor do we know a prohibition.
al-Shaykh: Fine, and is this statement correct? Do not ask people for anything, even if someone hands me a whip, and if a man drops the whip from his hand from the camel he touches the camel and saddles it until he takes the whip? Or does he say to someone: please give me?
Questioner: He mentioned this ḥadīth and used it as evidence, and he said that duʿāʼ — I mean — is asking.
al-Shaykh: Indeed asking, but not forbidden, the better [course] is that one does not ask.
Questioner: That is: it is better not to ask?
al-Shaykh: If he cannot, if he cannot, ah, so we ask Allah ʿazza wa-jall that He deliver us from tribulations, manifest and hidden — I mean — life is very difficult that one lives today.
Questioner: Our Shaykh, there is the ḥadīth of the blind man who came to the Prophet ﷺ and asked him to supplicate for him, and the Prophet ﷺ chose for him between that he supplicate for him or that he be patient; this is an affirmation by the Prophet ﷺ of duʿāʼ.
al-Shaykh: Of course, but he said: “If you are patient, that is better for you.” ﷺ

P42 - Questioner: One of the sisters wrote a question, and Abu Aḥmad gave it to him, she says in the first question: Is it permissible for a woman to go out for ziyārāt while her husband is absent, i.e., traveling? And what are the limits of her leaving her house?

P43 - al-Shaykh: The principle in this: that the woman should know that she was created to remain in her house and serve her husband and raise her children if she has children, and if she has no child then it suffices her to attend to her house and her husband, then it is permissible for her to go out to accomplish some necessities which the husband or one of her close male relatives (maḥārim) cannot attend to or it is not possible for others to do for her, then there is no harm in her going out to visit her companions or relatives within limits not many as is the case with men, because men were not addressed as women were addressed in the saying of the Exalted: “And abide in your homes and do not display yourselves like the display of the former Jahiliyyah” — this should be set before the woman’s eyes, that is: that her going out should not be like the man’s going out without reckoning and without limits, even if her husband does not object to that, if this is known we enter into the core of the answer to the question: if the husband is traveling and her going out is restricted, that is: not frequent as we mentioned, and the husband does not object to that then it is permissible for her to go out otherwise not; in brief her going out which we constricted its circle for her as a woman the principle is: it is permissible, but the woman does not have the authority to enjoy doing every permissible thing even if it contravenes the husband; so her leaving her house to visit some of her female friends for example the principle is that it is permissible, but if the husband wants her to remain in the family home during his absence then she must not go out and it is not permissible for her to go out — that is the answer to the question.

Questioner: Our Shaykh, some say that an-naṃṣ in Arabic means plucking the eyebrow hair?
al-Shaykh: Not correct, that is false.
Questioner: A falsehood against the language or a lie?
al-Shaykh: A falsehood against the language, an-naṃṣ and natf are measures and meanings, namṣ is three letters and natf is three letters, that one is nūn, mīm, ṣād, this is nūn, tāʼ, fāʼ, they are a measure and a meaning — one.
Questioner: That is: synonyms? Same meaning?
al-Shaykh: Yes, synonyms.
Another questioner: Does everything fall under this?
al-Shaykh: Everything that God has not permitted if this were specific, how did He say: “Five of the fitrah” and He mentioned natf al-ibaṭ, this is an Arabic usage even prophetic: that natf is not specific to the eyebrows.
Questioner: The Prophet ﷺ excepted the pubic hair and the armpit.
al-Shaykh: No, he excepted the armpit, because of the pubic hair he did not say: natf al-ʿānah, he said: “and shave the pubic hair,” but the important point: “Five of the fitrah” mentioned among them: natf al-ibaṭ, so how can it be said: natf is specific to the eyebrows?!

P44 - Questioner: We know that watching television is not permissible, but what about a person whose circumstances compel him to watch it?
al-Shaykh: His circumstances, I do not think there are circumstances, I mean ha, how do these people speak? By God it is astonishing!
A man in attendance: I mean after you say no doubt, I mean in some circumstances, I mean in some areas which are villages …
A man in attendance: My teacher, we have now here for example especially at dinnertime because it requires us to sit and eat together, and the television is on, but I often pretend I go into the rooms … … so for that reason we go and turn it off — he said followers of the series how … My teacher? Better that one not eat.
al-Shaykh: You mean you have not seen television.
One of those present: I am not speaking for myself I speak for my household for example like my wife and my children.
al-Shaykh: Your wife may be reconciled with you.

P45 - Questioner: Lying is forbidden, but if a person is compelled to it to prevent a catastrophe that is about to occur if the truth were told, does the same ruling remain?
al-Shaykh: If the question is correct the ruling does not remain the same, if the premise is correct then the ruling does not remain the same.
One of those present: Lying is only permissible in three cases?
al-Shaykh: Yes, lying is only permissible in three [cases].
Questioner: And by this question it is permissible because it is a catastrophe.
al-Shaykh: Yes, this reminds me of a discussion that took place between me and the Qādiyāniyyah in Dimashq, these have, of course, very serious deviations, apparently I forgot his name, the important thing: there were many sessions between me and them, then we agreed to have a debate or a written disputation … he says: this ḥadīth does not suit the station of the prophets, how can Ibrāhīm lie and Allah says in the Qurʾān: “and he was a truthful prophet” Allah says “a truthful prophet” and this ḥadīth says: (he lied three lies) this is a false ḥadīth, this discussion was between me and their great caller from among those Pakistanis, this Munīr al-Ḥiṣnī the title of his office … so the following discussion transpired between me and him: but it was logical and very beautiful; I said to him: you absolve Ibrāhīm, may peace be upon him, from these three lies which are explained in the ḥadīth, so should I understand from you that lying is forbidden even if it will save a believer’s life from a disbeliever? He said to me: yes, and at that time we were newly affected by the French Revolution or rather the Syrian revolution against the French, and the revolutionaries used to attack what we call fortifications, you know what they call them? … then a rebel would come, two or three true fedāʼī would actually attach themselves to the French and the Senegals they used to bring from the blacks, and throw him two or three bombs, and like lightning they would disappear into the alleys and among the graves, and it was a very natural matter as occurs today in Filasṭīn, unfortunately they would soon extract him and search for who? The perpetrator, they would enter the houses and knock on doors, so I said to him: this (Munīr al-Ḥiṣnī), I said to him: if such an incident occurred to you and they come knocking at your door, and a man of those revolutionary Muslims had taken refuge with you, and this is what we call here: the gendarme, that is: the military, the French gendarme knocks on your door, he says to you: did someone hide in your house? What will you say if he enters?
