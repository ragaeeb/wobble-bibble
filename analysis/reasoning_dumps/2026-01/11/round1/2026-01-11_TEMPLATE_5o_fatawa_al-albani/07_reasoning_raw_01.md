Following translation and transliteration rules for Arabic script
I need to make sure I'm following the user's role constraints: only translating and keeping segment IDs intact. I'll stick to ALA-LC transliteration for Arabic names, like "Filasṭīn" for فلسطين and "Afghānistān" for أفغانستان. I’ll make sure to remove Arabic script except for exceptions like ﷺ.

Focusing on ALA-LC transliteration consistency
I have to make sure I'm following the consistency rules: transliterating all Arabic-script names, titles, and places using full ALA-LC, like "al-ʿUthaymīn." I'll also maintain glossary terms (e.g., Allah, Rasulullah). I must keep segment IDs and avoid correcting typos or adding extra commentary, translating literally.

Balancing literal translation and transliteration rules
I need to follow the user's rule to translate literally while keeping specific terms, like "Filasṭīn" for فلسطين. For phrases like "كفلسطين", I’ll go with “like Filasṭīn,” preserving the transliteration but ensuring it makes sense in context. I'll stick to ALA-LC for Arabic names, but may use English terms if they are already commonly known.

Adhering to translation rules for titles and roles
I need to follow the rule for Arabic script names and titles, using full ALA-LC transliteration like "al-Shaykh" for الشيخ and "al-Sāʾil" for السائل. For Q&A, the mapping is clear: "Al-Sāʾil" becomes "Questioner" and "al-Shaykh" becomes "Answer." But for non-Q&A segments, I’ll keep the titles as transliterated.

Focusing on literal translation and transliterations
For phrases like "أحد الحضور," I’ll go with "One of the attendees" to stay literal. I’ll use "A man in attendance" for "رجل من الحضور." For proper names, I need to follow ALA-LC, like "Munīr al-Ḥiṣnī" for "منير الحصني." I'll maintain special translation rules for terms like ḥadīth, gendarme, and use ﷺ for Prophet references.

Deciding on transliterations for places and names
For places like "السنغال" (Senegal), I’ll transliterate it to "Sinigāl" following ALA-LC, but it feels safer for some country names to keep them in English like "Senegal." For personal names and important places like "Filasṭīn" (Palestine), I’ll stay consistent with ALA-LC transliteration throughout.

Translating with accuracy while observing rules
For Arabic names like "منير الحصني," I’ll transliterate to "Munīr al-Ḥiṣnī." I'll also ensure to preserve Arabic terms like "النبي" as ﷺ and "حديث" as ḥadīth from the glossary. For specific phrases like "الزيارات," I’ll translate it as "visits" or "ziyārāt," depending on context. I’ll also translate Quranic verses accurately while retaining key terms like "Jahiliyyah."
