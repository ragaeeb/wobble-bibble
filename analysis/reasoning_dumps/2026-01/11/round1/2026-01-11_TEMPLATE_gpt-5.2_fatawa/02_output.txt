P1 - Al-Shaykh: Indeed all praise is for Allah; we praise Him, seek His help, and seek His forgiveness. We seek refuge in Allah from the evils of ourselves and from the evil deeds of our actions. Whomever Allah guides, none can misguide him; and whomever He misguides, none can guide him. And I bear witness that there is no deity but Allah alone, with no partner; and I bear witness that Muḥammad is His servant and His Messenger. To proceed: Indeed, the best speech is the speech of Allah, and the best guidance is the guidance of Muḥammad ﷺ; and the worst matters are their newly-invented ones. Every newly-invented matter is a bidʿah (innovation), every bidʿah (innovation) is misguidance, and every misguidance is in the Fire.

P1a - Perhaps the brothers present, all of them, know from the indication of this ḥadīth (hadith) and its likes—what is established in the books of the sunnah (Prophetic practice) and ṣaḥīḥ (authentic) in isnād (chain of narration) to the Prophet ﷺ—such as the ḥadīth (hadith) of ʿĀʾishah: “Whoever introduces into this affair of ours what is not from it, it is rejected,” and the ḥadīth (hadith) of al-ʿIrbāḍ b. Sāriyah, may Allah, Exalted, be pleased with him, who said: “The Messenger of Allah ﷺ admonished us with an admonition from which the hearts trembled and the eyes shed tears, so we said: O Messenger of Allah, counsel us.” He said: “I counsel you to fear Allah, and to hear and obey even if an Abyssinian slave is placed in authority over you. Indeed, whoever among you lives will see much اختلافًا (difference). So adhere to my sunnah (Prophetic practice) and the sunnah (Prophetic practice) of the Rightly Guided, guided Caliphs after me; bite onto it with the molars. And beware the newly-invented matters; every newly-invented matter is a bidʿah (innovation), and every bidʿah (innovation) is misguidance.” These ḥadīth (hadith)s confirm what I think you understand and believe: that innovating in the dīn (religion), all of it, is misguidance—and I mean in the dīn (religion), because the blameworthy innovation is specific to the dīn (religion). As for worldly matters, among them is what is praiseworthy and among them is what is blameworthy, according to this newly-invented thing: if it conflicts with the Sharīʿah then it is blameworthy; and if it does not conflict with the Sharīʿah then it is, at the least, permissible. Among the best that is transmitted on this occasion is the statement of Shaykh al-Islām Ibn Taymiyyah, may Allah have mercy on him, where he laid down a very important principle he derived from those ḥadīth (hadith)s along with other texts indicating that the foundation concerning things is permissibility—and this is a uṣūlī principle—so he, may Allah have mercy on him, said: “The foundation in the dīn (religion) is prohibition except with a text, and the foundation in the world is permissibility except with a text.” He means: every newly-invented matter in the dīn (religion) is forbidden; as for the newly-invented matter in the world, it is permitted unless it conflicts with a text, as we mentioned. Then among what should be drawn attention to is that his saying ﷺ: “Beware the newly-invented matters” only means every act of worship introduced after the Prophet ﷺ, so it is misguidance, even if, in the view of many people, they consider it good. And ʿAbd Allāh b. ʿUmar b. al-Khaṭṭāb, may Allah, Exalted, be pleased with him, rightly said: “Every bidʿah (innovation) is misguidance, even if people see it as good.” That is because deeming something good in the dīn (religion) means that this one who deems it good has paired himself with the Lord of the worlds, for none besides Him may legislate except what Allah, Mighty and Majestic, wills. For this reason al-Imām al-Shāfiʿī, may Allah have mercy on him, said: Whoever deems something good has legislated—because how does this one who deems it good know that what he deemed good by his mind and thought alone, without taking it from the Book of his Lord or from the sunnah (Prophetic practice) of His Prophet—how can he know that this is a good matter?! Therefore our stance, all of us, toward every newly-invented matter in the dīn (religion) must be refraining from it, by what preceded from ṣaḥīḥ (authentic) ḥadīth (hadith)s.

P2 - Al-Sāʾil: Some of the brothers sitting hear about the Salafī daʿwah by hearing, and they read about it what is written by its opponents, not by its followers and its callers. So what is sought from your eminence—while you are among the scholars of Salafiyyah and its callers—is an explanation of the position of Salafiyyah among the Islamic groups today. Al-Shaykh: I have answered a question like this more than once, but an answer is necessary since a question has been posed. So I say: a word of truth that no Muslim can dispute after the truth becomes clear to him:

P2a - First of that: the Salafī daʿwah—attributed to what? Salafiyyah is an attribution to the Salaf, so we must know who the Salaf are when, among the scholars of the Muslims, the term “Salaf” is used; and consequently this attribution is understood, and what its weight is in its meaning and its indication. The Salaf are the people of the three centuries that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ testified to as being the best, in the ṣaḥīḥ (authentic), mutawātir ḥadīth (hadith) extracted in the al-Ṣaḥīḥayn and others, from a group of the Companions from the Prophet ﷺ, that he said: “The best of people are my century, then those who follow them, then those who follow them.” These three centuries that the Messenger ﷺ testified to as being the best—Salafiyyah belongs to this Salaf, and the Salafīs belong to these Salaf. If we know the meaning of the Salaf and Salafiyyah, then I say two matters: The first matter is that this attribution is not an attribution to a person or persons, as are the attributions of other groups present today on the Islamic earth. This is not an attribution to a person nor to dozens of persons; rather this attribution is an attribution to infallibility, because it is impossible for the righteous Salaf to agree upon misguidance—unlike the later generations, for the later generations did not come in the Sharīʿah with praise for them; rather blame came regarding their multitudes, and that is in the completion of the previous ḥadīth (hadith) where he ﷺ said: “Then there will come after them people who will testify and will not be asked to testify…” to the end of the ḥadīth (hadith). As he ﷺ indicated that in another ḥadīth (hadith) in which there is praise for a group of the Muslims and blame for their multitudes by the implication of the ḥadīth (hadith), where he ﷺ said: “There will continue to be a group from my ummah manifest upon the truth; those who oppose them will not harm them until the command of Allah comes,” or “until the Hour is established.” This ḥadīth (hadith) specified praise at the end of time for a ṭāʾifah, and the ṭāʾifah is the small group; for in the language it is applied to the individual and above. So if we know this meaning in Salafiyyah—that it belongs to the جماعت (community) of the righteous Salaf and that they are the infallibility in that if the Muslim holds fast to what those righteous Salaf were upon—then comes the second matter I pointed to earlier: that every Muslim, when he knows then this attribution and what it aims at of infallibility, it becomes impossible for him after this knowledge and clarification that—I do not say: that—he renounce it; this is self-evident, but I say: it becomes impossible for him except to be Salafī, because we understood that belonging to Salafiyyah means belonging to infallibility. From where did we take this infallibility?

P2b - We take it from a ḥadīth (hadith) that some of the later generations use as evidence against the truth; they use it as evidence for arguing by taking the majority—what the multitudes of the later generations are upon—when they bring his ﷺ saying: “My ummah will not gather upon misguidance.” It is not correct to apply this ḥadīth (hadith) to the later generations today given the deep disagreements among them; “My ummah will not gather upon misguidance” cannot be applied to the reality of the Muslims today, and this is something every student of this bad reality knows. Added to that are the ṣaḥīḥ (authentic) ḥadīth (hadith)s that came clarifying what occurred among those before us of the Jews and the Christians, and what will occur among the Muslims after the Messenger ﷺ of division. So he ﷺ said: “The Jews split into seventy-one sects, and the Christians into seventy-two sects, and my ummah will split into seventy-three sects, all of them in the Fire except one.” They said: Which is it, O Messenger of Allah? He said: “It is the Jamāʿah.” This Jamāʿah is the Jamāʿah of the Messenger ﷺ; it is the one about which it can be decisively stated, in applying the previous ḥadīth (hadith) “My ummah will not gather upon misguidance,” that what is intended by this ḥadīth (hadith) is the Companions whom the Messenger ﷺ judged to be the saved sect, and whoever follows their path and takes their direction. And these righteous Salaf are those whom our Lord, Mighty and Majestic, warned us in the Noble Qurʾān against opposing them and against following a path other than their path, in His saying, Mighty and Majestic: “And whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him and follows other than the path of the believers, We will turn him to what he has turned to, and We will make him enter Jahannam—and an evil destination.” I have drawn our brothers’ attention on many occasions to the wisdom of our Lord, Mighty and Majestic, conjoining in this verse His saying “and follows other than the path of the believers” to opposing the Messenger—what is the wisdom of that? Even though, if the verse were by omitting this clause—if it were as follows: “And whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him, We will turn him to what he has turned to, and We will make him enter Jahannam—and an evil destination”—it would have been sufficient in warning and rebuking whoever opposes the Messenger ﷺ, and judging him with his evil destination. The verse was not like this; rather it added to that His saying, Mighty and Majestic: “and follows other than the path of the believers.” Is this frivolity?!

P2c - Far be it from the speech of Allah, Mighty and Majestic, to be frivolity—meaning: whoever follows other than the path of the Companions, who are the infallibility in our preceding expression, and who are the Jamāʿah that the Messenger ﷺ testified to as being the saved sect, and whoever follows their path—these are those whose path it is not permissible for one who wants to be saved from the punishment of Allah on the Day of Resurrection to oppose. For that reason He, Exalted, said: “And whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him and follows other than the path of the believers, We will turn him to what he has turned to, and We will make him enter Jahannam—and an evil destination.” Therefore the Muslims today at the end of time must know two matters:

P2d - First: who are the Muslims mentioned in this verse? Then what is the wisdom of hearing the Qurʾān and the ḥadīth (hadith)s of the Messenger ﷺ directly from him, and then they had the virtue of observing the Messenger ﷺ applying the texts of the Book and the sunnah (Prophetic practice) as a practical application? And among the wisdom explicitly stated in the sunnah (Prophetic practice) is his ﷺ saying: “Reporting is not like seeing,” and from it the poet began and from it he took his saying: “And no seer is like one who heard.” So those who did not witness the Messenger ﷺ are not like his Companions who saw and heard from him the speech directly, and saw from him a practical application. Today there is a modern expression some Islamic callers have coined, and it is a very beautiful expression, but more beautiful than it is to make it an actual reality: they say in their lectures, admonitions, and exhortations that we must make Islam a reality walking upon the earth. Beautiful speech; but if we do not understand Islam in light of the understanding of the righteous Salaf, as we say, we cannot realize this beautiful poetic speech—that we make Islam a real reality walking upon the earth. Those who were able to do that were the Companions of the Messenger ﷺ for the two reasons mentioned earlier: they heard the speech from him directly and thus comprehended it with the best comprehension; then there are matters that need a practical clarification, so they saw the Messenger ﷺ clarify that for them in action. I will give you a very clear example: there are verses in the Noble Qurʾān that a Muslim cannot understand unless he knows the sunnah (Prophetic practice) that clarifies the Noble Qurʾān, as He, Exalted, said: “And We sent down to you the Reminder so that you may clarify to the people what was sent down to them.” For example, His saying, Exalted: “As for the male thief and the female thief, cut their hands.” Now bring us Sībawayh of this time in the Arabic language and let him explain this noble verse: “the male thief”—who is he? Linguistically, he cannot define the thief. And what is the hand? Sībawayh of the end of time cannot answer these two questions: who is the thief that deserves cutting of the hand, and what is the hand that should be cut for this thief?

P2e - In language, if the thief steals an egg he is a thief; and the hand—if it is cut here or here or in any place, it is a hand. But the answer is when he mentioned the previous verse: “And We sent down to you the Reminder so that you may clarify to the people what was sent down to them”—the answer is in the clarification. So there is clarification from the Messenger ﷺ of the Qurʾān; and this clarification he ﷺ applied in action specifically in this verse as an example, and specifically in other verses—and how many they are—because whoever reads in the science of uṣūl reads in uṣūl that there is general and specific, absolute and restricted, abrogating and abrogated—summarizing terms under which dozens of texts enter, if we do not say hundreds of texts: general texts the sunnah (Prophetic practice) has transmitted. And I do not want to prolong this so that we can answer the rest of the questions.

P3 - Al-Sāʾil: If the family refuses that their daughter visit a sister for her in Allah, and she longs for her and they always refuse this visit, does Islam permit her to go out to visit her without informing them of that? Or should she tell them something untrue? Al-Shaykh: It is not permissible for her to visit her without the permission of her parents, just as it is not permissible for her to lie to them. Rather she must convince the parents that this visit the Wise Legislator commands. If they are convinced, then so be it; and if they are not convinced, then it is not permissible for the girl—especially if she claims that she is committed to the Sharīʿah—to depart from obedience to her parents in such a visit. Al-Sāʾil: My teacher, regarding—also the lessons, does that apply to that? We are in a lesson, for example, an admonition in something? Al-Shaykh: The same thing; permission is necessary.

P4 - Al-Sāʾil: What is the ruling on wearing the khimār—covering the face and the hands—at the present time? And if the girl feels temptation and chooses to wear it but the family refuses, especially the mother, what should she do? Al-Shaykh: If the refusal is limited to the face and the hands, then obedience to the parents is required in that. But if the refusal includes more than that, then there is no obedience to a created being in disobedience to the Creator—meaning: it is obligatory upon the woman to cover all her body except the face and the hands; covering them is not obligatory, but it is recommended. So if the father does not approve that his daughter cover her face and hands, then there is no harm in obeying them, and there is no disobedience in that—unlike if they desire from her that she uncover other than the face and hands; then there is no obedience to them upon her, because that is disobedience.

P5 - The īshārib is not sufficient; it must be a khimār such that it covers all the head and the chest opening. The īshārib is not ample, and its covering is not sufficient. Al-Sāʾil: Does the covering include the shoulders as well, our teacher? Al-Shaykh: Yes; this is the khimār. The description of the khimār is that it is loose and wide: it covers the head and covers the shoulders. When we say it covers the chest opening, then when it covers the chest opening it covers the shoulders because it is wide. As for the īshārib, many times we see women where something of the neck appears because of the īshārib, whereas the khimār covers the neck and the shoulders together. And Allah commanded that; He said: “And let them draw their headcovers over their bosoms.” As for this īshārib, it is from the category—as is said today—of half solutions; and in Islam there are no half solutions. Al-Sāʾil: My teacher, many now among some—meaning the committed men and committed women in the dīn (religion) and in their clothing—believe that the khimār is the covering of the face? Al-Shaykh: This is ignorance of the language. The khimār is the covering of the head; thus the man khatamara, meaning: he places the khimār on his head, and the woman as well. For that reason He said: “And let them draw their headcovers over their bosoms.” If the khimār covered the face, He would not say “draw,” meaning: tighten it; rather there is draping. This is ignorance of the language.

P6 - Al-Sāʾil: If a woman does not wear a high heel in the shoe, is it permissible for her to do that? And what is the ruling? Al-Shaykh: It is not permissible to imitate the unbelieving women or the immoral women. The origin of this is from the Jewish women: they, in the past before Islam, if one of them wanted to attend the society where her lover was, so that he could see her, she would wear a type of high wooden sandal, thus she would become tall and be seen. Then with time this turned into the shoe with the high heel. As for this shoe that makes the woman—meaning—her walk changes, leaning right and left, and for that the immoral unbelievers invented this type of shoe; so it is not befitting for the committed Muslim woman to wear a shoe with a high heel, especially since in many cases it is a cause of her being harmed and falling on the top of her head if she stumbles in the road for the slightest reason.

P7 - Al-Sāʾil: Is it permissible to backbite the unbeliever and the polytheist woman? And is it permissible to insult them? Al-Shaykh: All of that is permissible, because the unbeliever has no sanctity—unless a harm results from that. For example: if he insults the unbeliever to his face or behind his back, and that reaches him, then perhaps he will insult the Muslim and insult his dīn (religion) and his Prophet, and so on. Then, in that case, it becomes forbidden for the Muslim to insult the polytheist.

P8 - Al-Sāʾil: In the verse “None touch it except the muṭahharūn,” what is intended by “the muṭahharūn”: the believers or those with wuḍūʾ? And what is the ruling of not taking the Qurʾān to the unbelieving lands? Al-Shaykh: What is intended by the verse is neither this nor that; rather what is intended is the angels. It is information from Allah, Mighty and Majestic, about the angels—and not this Qurʾān—but rather what is in the Preserved Tablet. So this muṣḥaf that is in the Preserved Tablet: “None touch it except the muṭahharūn,” and they are the angels brought near. This is a declarative sentence, not an imperative sentence—meaning: it issues a Sharʿī ruling. Allah is speaking about reality: that the Qurʾān—meaning what is in the Hidden Book, meaning the Preserved Tablet—this: “None touch it except the muṭahharūn,” and they are the angels brought near. As for the muṣḥaf that is between our hands, the righteous and the wicked touch it, and the believer and the unbeliever; so our Lord, Mighty and Majestic, does not intend by this verse humankind at all—whether they are righteous or wicked—rather He intends, as we said, the angels brought near.

P8a - As for traveling with the Qurʾān and the muṣḥaf to the land of the enemy, it is not permissible unless it is safe that it will be touched with harm and that it will be dishonored; then it is permissible, if we are safe that the muṣḥaf will be dishonored, to bring it into the lands of the unbelievers—perhaps they, meaning, will be able to read it and study it.

P9 - [And the beginning of the answer is cut off] For that reason he ﷺ said: “Every creation of Allah is good.” Yes. Someone—male or female—whose eyebrow or eyebrows are connected with the other: this is not something a person controls; this is the creation of Allah, so we must be content with the creation of Allah, as He, Blessed and Exalted, said—yes, he mentioned the verse. The point is that our Lord, Mighty and Majestic—now the verse came: “And your Lord creates what He wills and chooses; they have no choice. Glory be to Allah, and Exalted is He above what they associate.” This is the answer to the last question.

P10 - Al-Sāʾil al-Shaykh ʿAlī Ḥasan al-Ḥalabī: Regarding reciting the Qurʾān and touching the muṣḥaf for the junub, what is the ruling on that? And ṭawāf around the House as well. Al-Shaykh: And ṭawāf around the House—yes. Al-Sāʾil al-Shaykh ʿAlī b. Ḥasan al-Ḥalabī: Touching the muṣḥaf and reciting the Qurʾān—meaning—not that it is a part of a verse, nor, for example, seeking blessing or fear, something deliberate; and he touches the muṣḥaf and recites. So what is the ruling on that as well? Give us a ruling, may Allah benefit you. Al-Shaykh: May Allah bless everyone. We say: there is no doubt that the remembrance of Allah, Blessed and Exalted, has its sanctity and its inviolability; and for that it is agreed upon among the scholars of the Muslims that reciting the Qurʾān in complete purity is better and more fitting to the greatness of the speech of Allah, Mighty and Majestic. And if it has been authentically established from the Prophet ﷺ that he refused to utter one of the names of Allah, Mighty and Majestic—namely al-Salām—except in a state of purity, in the well-known ḥadīth (hadith) in the Sunan, like Musnad Aḥmad and others: that a man gave salām to the Prophet ﷺ, and he ﷺ did nothing except hurry to a wall, perform wuḍūʾ, and return the salām, and he said: “I disliked to mention Allah except in a state of purity.” To mention Allah, because al-Salām is one of the names of Allah—just as also in the ṣaḥīḥ (authentic) ḥadīth (hadith) in Kitāb al-Adab al-Mufrad of al-Imām al-Bukhārī, from the ḥadīth (hadith) of ʿAbd Allāh b. Masʿūd, who said: the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: “Al-Salām is a name from the names of Allah; He placed it on the earth, so spread it among yourselves.” This al-Salām—the Messenger ﷺ disliked to return it to the one who gave him salām except in a state of purity.

P10a - As for reciting the Qurʾān while not in a state of purity—whether minor purity or major purity—there is no evidence prohibiting the Muslim from reciting the Qurʾān while not in a state of purity; but this ḥadīth (hadith) contains a very clear encouragement to recite the Qurʾān while in complete purity. But here is something: this ruling—namely what is best, in the most complete, full form—is not possible for every legally-responsible person among the Muslims, except men only. As for women, then sometimes and sometimes. And earlier you heard the Messenger’s ﷺ statement to ʿĀʾishah when she menstruated; he said to her: “Do what the pilgrim does, except do not perform ṭawāf and do not pray.” So then it is not said to her: perform wuḍūʾ as we say to the man, because she cannot, legally, perform wuḍūʾ; she cannot, legally, purify herself. Therefore she may recite whatever she wishes from the Qurʾān without our saying: outweighed and outweighing, as we say regarding the junub man, for example. We say: he must perform ghusl, because he can perform ghusl; thereby he purifies himself. So we say: it is better for you to purify yourself. As for the menstruating woman, as for the postpartum woman in whom sometimes—in some types of women—forty days or more pass while she is in postpartum bleeding, it is said to her: do not recite! We do not have evidence that prevents the Muslim in general—men let alone women—from reciting the Qurʾān except while in a state of purity. And the ḥadīth (hadith) that al-Tirmidhī narrated in his Sunan from the ḥadīth (hadith) of Ibn ʿUmar, may Allah, Exalted, be pleased with him, who said: the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: “A menstruating woman and a junub do not recite the Qurʾān.” This is a munkar ḥadīth (hadith), as the Imām of the sunnah (Prophetic practice) Aḥmad b. Ḥanbal says. This ḥadīth (hadith) is not ṣaḥīḥ (authentic); if it were ṣaḥīḥ (authentic), it would be obligatory to stop at it. Along with the weakness of this ḥadīth (hadith) and what may be in the chapter of its likes from the ḍaʿīf (weak) ones, we have before us the ḥadīth (hadith) of ʿĀʾishah, where he ﷺ commanded her and permitted her to do everything the pilgrim does except that she does not pray and does not perform ṭawāf. Do you think the pilgrim does not recite the Qurʾān? Rather there is a season for reciting the Qurʾān, because there is free time and because the pilgrim’s whole being is turned to Allah, Blessed and Exalted; without doubt he recites the Qurʾān. So this ḥadīth (hadith) contains a direct permission for the menstruating woman to recite the Qurʾān; so it is not permissible to prevent women from reciting the Qurʾān on the claim that she is not pure. If Allah had prevented her as He prevented her from prayer, we would have stopped at that prevention and ended. But we find the Wise Legislator has revealed to the Noble Messenger the distinction between prayer and the parts of prayer, because some people say: O brother, recitation is a pillar among the pillars of prayer! So why do we not obligate purity for this recitation though it is a part of the parts of prayer?

P10b - So we say: recitation alone is not the only part among the parts of prayer. The first thing the prayer is opened with is our saying: Allahu akbar. So let us say: then it is not permissible for a Muslim to say “Allahu akbar” except in a state of purity, because it is a pillar among the pillars of prayer. Likewise it is said about tasbīḥ, taḥmīd, takbīr, and so on—there is no escape from that at all—while maintaining what we mentioned of what is best: that one remembers Allah in a state of purity. Likewise it is said exactly regarding touching the Qurʾān: touching the Qurʾān is legislated. آثار (reports) have come from some of the Companions that they would refrain—in action, not merely in thought—from touching the Qurʾān except upon wuḍūʾ. This clarifies what is best for one who wants to touch the Qurʾān or to recite the Qurʾān. As for obligation and saying that it is forbidden for the impure woman, let alone the man, to touch the Qurʾān—there is no evidence for that at all. And people, without doubt, imagine that there are evidences, but they are not evidences at all. Among that is, for example, what is confused for many people—especially those who have passion and care for reciting the Qurʾān—when he reads the saying of Allah, Mighty and Majestic, in the Qurʾān: “None touch it except the muṭahharūn.” The error in carrying this verse upon this subject that we are in—meaning: that they interpret His saying “none touch it” as meaning this muṣḥaf that is between our hands, and “except the muṭahharūn” as meaning those with wuḍūʾ—this delusion reached the point that it is published on every copy that is printed in the Islamic world of the Noble Qurʾān: the title “None touch it except the muṭahharūn.” This is an error resembling another error—first in intellectual, scholarly error, then in publishing and generalizing it to people—namely the verse that is written on the miḥrābs: “Every time Zakariyyā entered upon her in the miḥrāb, he found with her provision.” Miḥrāb meaning a niche—this is a lie. This is ignorance. What is meant by miḥrāb is the place of prayer: “Every time Zakariyyā entered upon her in the miḥrāb,” meaning: the room in which she was isolated from people, worshipping Allah, Mighty and Majestic; this is the miḥrāb. The miḥrāb is not this which was introduced into the mosques from long ago, unfortunately, in imitation of the miḥrābs of churches—the miḥrābs of the Christians in their churches. Otherwise in Islam there is no miḥrāb. The mosque of the Messenger ﷺ had no miḥrāb. And the famous Egyptian ḥāfiẓ al-Suyūṭī—the ḥāfiẓ al-Suyūṭī, the author of al-Jāmiʿ al-Kabīr and al-Jāmiʿ al-Ṣaghīr—has a treatise (I may have forgotten its title)—yes—called Iʿlām al-Arīb, and it is a very valuable study: he نقل (transmits) there texts from the people of knowledge that the presence of miḥrābs in mosques is among the newly-invented matters.

P10c - The point: the previous verse “None touch it except the muṭahharūn” has no relation to the subject of touching the Qurʾān that is between our hands. This has a lengthy explanation; I will summarize it as much as possible, so I say: “none touch it”—the pronoun here returns to the hidden book mentioned before, because Allah, Mighty and Majestic, says: “None touch it except the muṭahharūn,” returning to the hidden book. Our book, praise be to Allah, is not hidden—because what does maknūn mean? Meaning hidden, protected, meaning: neither do you see it nor do the hands of devils reach it. For that reason al-Imām Mālik, may Allah have mercy on him—meaning—has a good and very subtle understanding in his book al-Muwaṭṭaʾ in interpreting this verse, where he says: The best I have heard regarding its interpretation is that it is like the verse in Sūrat ʿAbasa: “No! It is surely a reminder. So whoever wills remembers it, in honored pages, exalted and purified, in the hands of سفرة (scribes), noble and righteous.” Who are these safarah? The angels. These angels are themselves what is meant: that they touch, and others than them do not touch that hidden book. This is a contextual indicator, and there are other contextual indicators; among the strongest of them is that He, Exalted, said: “except the muṭahharūn.” We, humankind, are not permitted to describe ourselves—no matter how high we rise and how lofty we become in righteousness and piety—as being muṭahharūn. We are not muṭahharūn, and it is not permitted for a person to claim purification at all. Rather we are mulawwathūn, and the righteous among us is the one who exerts himself and then purifies himself—the righteous among us exerts himself, meaning: he affects purity, otherwise it is not his trait that he is pure. The muṭahharūn are the angels described in the Noble Qurʾān by His saying, Mighty and Majestic: “They do not disobey Allah in what He commands them, and they do what they are commanded.” As for humans, they are those about whom Allah, Mighty and Majestic, said: “Indeed Allah loves those who repent, and He loves those who purify themselves.” Likewise when He mentioned Masjid Qubāʾ He said: “In it are men who love to purify themselves.” So if we are like them, then congratulations to us: meaning, we purify ourselves. But as for being muṭahharūn—far, far. So the point regarding using this verse as evidence and linking it to this subject—this is a widespread error. Among the best who spoke about this verse—better than what we mentioned, and from him we derived—is the ʿallāmah Ibn al-Qayyim al-Jawziyyah, in his book Aqsām al-Qurʾān; there he expanded and did well. Perhaps in this there is sufficiency, if Allah wills.

P11 - Al-Sāʾil: What is the ruling on making a stipulation in ḥajj and ʿumrah: “O Allah, my place of release is where You confine me,” and what is required of one who makes a stipulation in order to complete his ritual? Al-Shaykh: The ruling of making a stipulation is permissibility, and its fruit is that if one stipulates—one who intends ḥajj or ʿumrah—then something befalls him that prevents him from completing the ḥajj or ʿumrah, and this is known in the language of the Law as iḥṣār; then: “and if you are prevented, then whatever offering is easy.” This is an obligatory matter: everyone who is not able to complete the ḥajj must offer a sacrifice and must perform ḥajj the following year—unlike one who stipulated at the beginning of his iḥrām and said: “O Allah, my place of release is where You confine me.” He is released from the obligation of repeating the ḥajj that was blocked between him and it; and then the sacrifice is not obligatory upon him—unlike if he did not stipulate. For this is what the Messenger ﷺ intended in the well-known ṣaḥīḥ (authentic) ḥadīth (hadith) from him, namely his ﷺ saying: “Whoever breaks (a bone), or becomes ill, or limps, then he has exited, and upon him is another ḥajj the following year.” This is if he did not stipulate. As for if he stipulated, then there is nothing upon him at all—while drawing attention that repeating is upon him even if he had performed the obligatory ḥajj, the ḥajj of Islam. So if he did not stipulate and was prevented and could not continue the ḥajj, then upon him the following year is repeating the ḥajj even if he had performed the obligatory ḥajj. This is the answer to what you asked.

P12 - Al-Shaykh: … meaning: you are asking about the ḥadīth (hadith): “They do not perform ruqyah and they do not seek ruqyah.” Here is a question I will pose to you, with its answer, if Allah wills, after I deliver a brief word about an etiquette from the etiquettes of gatherings that is neglected today—especially by people, let alone their commoners. Among these etiquettes is gathering, clustering, and drawing close in the sitting, and not spacing out in it. This is from the wisdoms of the Sharīʿah in many of its outward rulings, which have been explicitly stated in some ṣaḥīḥ (authentic) ḥadīth (hadith)s. There is, for example, in Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim the ḥadīth (hadith) of Jābir b. Samurah—so far as I recall—that the Prophet ﷺ entered the mosque one day and saw them separated, circle by circle, so he said to them: “What is it that I see you ʿizzīn?”

P12a - Meaning: separated. And more important than this is what al-Imām Aḥmad relates in his book al-Musnad with a strong isnād (chain of narration) from Abū Thaʿlabah al-Khushanī, may Allah, Exalted, be pleased with him. He said: When we traveled with the Prophet ﷺ and we stopped, we would spread out in the mountain passes and valleys. So we traveled one day and stopped as we used to stop, and he ﷺ said to them: “Indeed your spreading out in these passes and valleys is only from the work of Satan.” He said: after that, when we stopped in a place, we gathered such that if we sat on a mat it would have sufficed us. So what do you think—you all—sitting here on a leveled, smoothed surface: this separation is not from the sunnah (Prophetic practice) of Islam. Therefore, the more the circle draws close, the more it is encompassed by the mercy of Allah, Mighty and Majestic, and His bounty. Many people are ignorant that there is a very strong, close connection between a person’s outward and his inward; and this close connection is indicated by many ḥadīth (hadith)s of the Messenger ﷺ. Perhaps you know the expression mentioned in many books: “The outward is the title of the inward.” This is what the poet indicated long ago when he said: Whatever trait there may be in a person, even if he thinks it hidden from people, it will be known.

P12b - There must be a connection between the outward and the inward. For that reason the Messenger ﷺ gave great care to rectifying the outwards of the Muslims, let alone their inwards. He ﷺ, just as he came to rectify hearts and inwards, likewise came to rectify bodies and outwards together. The matter is not only as many people say: the consideration is what is in the inward—yes, the consideration is what is in the inward, but that does not entail not caring for the outward. For that reason he ﷺ said when he saw that man—or heard that man say—while the Messenger ﷺ was admonishing people to obey Allah and follow His Book: that man stood to say to him: “Whatever Allah wills and you will, O Messenger of Allah.” So he ﷺ became very angry, and he said: “Say: whatever Allah alone wills.” This is an outward expression that appeared from the tongue of that Companion by mistake from him; but this outward was contrary to his inward with certainty, because his inward was full of faith in Allah and His Messenger ﷺ. Yet when he erred in the wording, the Messenger ﷺ did not remain silent about him; rather he corrected his expression and said to him: “Say: whatever Allah alone wills.” The Messenger ﷺ knew with certainty that this man did not intend what his wording indicated; his wording indicated that he made the Messenger a partner with Allah in His will, Blessed and Exalted. But this Companion knew that the will of Allah, Blessed and Exalted, precedes everything and is above everything, because he reads in the Noble Qurʾān: “And you do not will except that Allah, Lord of the worlds, wills.” No one imagines that this Companion was ignorant of this reality. But his tongue made a mistake; yet the Messenger ﷺ corrected him and guided him to what he should say. He said to him: “Say: whatever Allah alone wills,” and in another narration: “Whatever Allah wills, then you will.” The ḥadīth (hadith)s in this regard are many, and I am not now in the position of explaining them, because it is a word about gathering in the sitting and not separating in it. But before I finish it, I find myself compelled to remind of only one other ḥadīth (hadith), because of how marvelous it is in the Messenger’s concern—may Allah’s prayers and peace be upon him—in rectifying people’s expressions and their outwards: namely his ﷺ saying: “Let none of you say: khabuthat nafsī. Let none of you say: khabuthat nafsī; but rather: laqisat.” What does laqisat mean?

P12c - In the language it equals: khabuthat. Laqisat, in the language, means: khabuthat. But the word “foul” is foul, so the Messenger ﷺ did not want the Muslim to utter it when he finds in himself something of this foulness with the word “foul”; rather he turned him away from it to the word laqisat. This word, naturally—and you are Arabs—you do not know it, but the master of Arabs and non-Arabs taught it to you, and he said: “Let none of you say: khabuthat nafsī; but rather: laqisat.” This is in the Muslim’s being well-mannered with himself, because he is a Muslim. So what about being well-mannered with Allah and with His Prophet ﷺ?! More so, the Muslim must be well-mannered with Allah, then with His Messenger ﷺ, and not come with an expression that may touch the station of prophethood or the station of messengership. Just now, the questioner should notice this. A questioner asked me between me and him; perhaps he said: is it legislated or is it permissible for the listener to the adhān …
