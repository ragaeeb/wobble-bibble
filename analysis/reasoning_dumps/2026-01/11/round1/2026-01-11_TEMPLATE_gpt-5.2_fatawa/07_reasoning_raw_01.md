Considering term consistency and translation choices
For terms like "Allah," "Rasulullah," and others, it's important to keep them consistent. "Messenger of Allah" seems to work well for "رسول الله." I'm wondering if "Allah, Exalted and Majestic" is the most fitting translation, but "Allah, Mighty and Majestic" could be okay too. I'll stay consistent in how I approach these.

Considering how to handle technical-translit terms
For terms like "ḥadīth" and "dīn," the glossary is clear about using the transliteration with the English meaning in parentheses. So, when "حديث" appears, I should use "ḥadīth (hadith)." Similarly, "بدعة" becomes "bidʿah (innovation)." I’ll keep this in mind, especially for other terms like "إسناد" and "الدين."

Translating terms following guidelines
For terms like "السنة," I'll translate it as "sunnah (Prophetic practice)" when it refers to a legal source. In cases without a chain of transmission, the translation could still focus on hadith content. I'll also keep segment IDs intact and avoid splitting segments or adding headings, keeping a direct translation structure.

Ensuring transliteration and punctuation consistency
I need to ensure no Arabic script remains, using full ALA-LC transliteration instead. For Quran verses, I’ll include diacritics, like the example “wa-rabbuka yakhluqu...” I've decided to keep punctuations like «...» as they appear in the original. I’ll also preserve colloquial words like "هدول" and "شو" in their transliterated form.

Translating terms exactly and maintaining rules
I must translate as written, so terms like "هدول" should stay as "these" to keep the dialect intact. For phrases like "شو رأيكم إنتم بأه," I'll translate it literally but keep the sense. For bracketed parts like "[وبداية الجواب مبتورة]," I'll translate directly. Translit terms like "السائل الشيخ علي حسن الحلبي" will follow the standard. Lastly, I’ll update salutation phrases like "صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم" to ﷺ.

Handling salutation phrases and technical terms
We must only use ﷺ when the phrase "صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ" or equivalent appears in the source. For "عليه السلام" or "الرسول عليه السلام," I'll treat these as equivalent and output ﷺ. "He ﷺ said" is fine too, even if it’s after a pronoun. For technical terms like "الإحصار," I'll use "iḥṣār (restriction)" if needed to stay accurate.

Translating Arabic terms and names correctly
For technical terms like "الإحصار," I’ll use transliteration ("iḥṣār"), but parentheses aren’t required unless it's a glossary term. For names like "اللوح المحفوظ," I’ll use full ALA-LC transliteration. "جهنم" should also be transliterated as "Jahannam." "الشيطان" isn't a name, so transliteration is optional.

Translating correctly while keeping accuracy
For terms like "Satan," I'll translate them into English. For "الفساق," translating to "the corrupt" works. I also need to handle specific names like "سيبويه" as "Sībawayh." I'll translate segments carefully, especially Qur'anic verses, without adding citations or notes, keeping everything exact.

Precise translation, keeping integrity
For P7, I’ll translate statements literally without euphemizing, especially regarding slander. In P8, I’ll ensure the correct transliteration of key verses. I'll carefully translate hadiths, maintaining authenticity, including examples of names with proper transliteration. P12c will include necessary explanations, keeping Arabic words as transliterations when needed for accuracy.

Translating while preserving meaning
I should translate "My soul has become foul" but keep the Arabic terms as transliterations to preserve their meaning. Since the original text uses parentheses for quotes and phrases, I’ll mirror those, but I’m careful to follow guidelines and avoid adding parentheses unless they're explicitly required for clarity.

Translating with guidelines and clarity
I need to follow the rules carefully. For translations, I should avoid parentheses except for glossary terms like ḥadīth (hadith) or bidʿah (innovation). I’ll use quotes for hadith and ensure diacritics are correct. Specific terms, like "Salafi" or "khalaf," will be transliterated, but I'll avoid parentheses to maintain the clarity and consistency required.

Translating with accurate terms and avoiding Arabic script
For translating, I need to avoid Arabic script, but for terminology like “al-ṣafarah” or “maknūn,” I can transliterate those terms instead. Quran verses and hadith are fine to translate but must maintain consistency and accuracy. I’ll make sure to convert Arabic punctuation to English and use transliteration where needed, like "miḥrāb" for specific terms.

Translating complex terms with accuracy
For translating terms like "al-Salām" (one of Allah's names) or "munkar," I'll use transliteration while ensuring clarity. I won't use parentheses for explanations, but I can include essential terms directly in transliteration. Additionally, I’ll carefully translate the content, avoiding Arabic script while replacing punctuation with English standard.

Translating technical terms and ensuring clarity
I need to be diligent in translating terms like "munkar," "ṣaḥīḥ," and "ruqyah," while making sure I respect the rules for parentheses and technical terms. For example, "ruqyah" stays transliterated, but "ḥadīth" and "sunnah" are handled carefully within context. I'll also make sure the terms are clear without confusing parentheses use.
