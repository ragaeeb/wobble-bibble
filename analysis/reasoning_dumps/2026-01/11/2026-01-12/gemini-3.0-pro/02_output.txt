P615b - And I mention that I had explained this issue in some works, and now the third volume of *Silsilat al-Aḥādīth al-Ḍaʿīfah wa-al-Mawḍūʿah* (The Series of Weak and Fabricated Ḥadīths) and their evil effect on the Ummah is being printed. It contains an introduction of about forty or fifty pages; I addressed this issue there as well. I clarified that the Islamic Ummah is in no need of acting upon a *ḥadīth* (report) attributed to the Prophet ﷺ when its attribution to him is not established. For Islām does not stand upon what resembles illusions. The weak *ḥadīth*, by the agreement of the scholars, yields nothing but conjecture, and outweighed conjecture (*al-ẓann al-marjūḥ*). The scholars of the Muslims are universally agreed that a legal ruling is not permitted to be established by outweighed conjecture. As for preponderant conjecture (*al-ẓann al-rājiḥ*), then yes. The weak *ḥadīth* yields nothing but outweighed conjecture. If the Prophet ﷺ warned his Ummah against narrating and attributing to him what is not authentic, then with greater reason, they should not act upon what is not authentic. Because, in reality, why do scholars narrate authentic *ḥadīths*? So that Muslims may act upon them.
Thus, the narration—we can say—in relation to action, is like the means to the end. Its example is like light in relation to prayer. Someone performs *wuḍūʾ* (ablution) but does not pray; look, this is purity and that is purity, it is a means... yes. Likewise, we narrate the *ḥadīth* but do not act upon it? No. The purpose of it is action, as He, the Exalted, said: "O you who have believed, why do you say what you do not do? Great is hatred in the sight of Allah that you say what you do not do" [Qurʾān 61:2-3]. I say, "The Messenger of Allah said such-and-such," yet I do not act upon what the Messenger of Allah said.
So narration is a means. If the means is commanded, what is the status of the end? It is commanded with greater reason. If the means is forbidden, what is the status of the end? It is forbidden with greater reason.
Therefore, the preponderant view among the sayings of the scholars regarding the weak *ḥadīth* is, firstly: There is no agreement on the permissibility of acting upon it; rather, it is a matter of dispute, as I mentioned.
Secondly: The preponderant view among the sayings of the scholars on this issue is that it is not permissible to act upon the weak *ḥadīth*.
Take the *adhkār* (remembrances) that have come from the Messenger عَلَيْهِ الصَّلَاة وَالسَّلَام; they are very many. Among them are the *ṣaḥīḥ* (authentic) and the *ḍaʿīf* (weak). I challenge the most devout person on the face of the earth—not in this time, but in the past times, in the time of obedience and devotion to worship—to be able to act upon everything that is authentic from the Messenger of Allah regarding all the *adhkār*, litanies, and supplications. It is impossible; it is a vast goodness and blessing. So what of our time? This time of ours, in which ambitions have weakened, and people have turned to materialism and earning money, and so on.

P615c - So then, the authentic *ḥadīths* we have are sufficient for us, rendering us in no need of weak *ḥadīths*. This is a reality we touch with our own hands. This is the answer to the first part of the question. As for the second part...
Questioner: You spoke about this in your book *Ghāyat al-Marām fī Takhrīj Aḥādīth al-Ḥalāl wa-al-Ḥarām* in its introduction.
The Shaykh: *Ghāyat al-Marām*, we say and speak about it.

P616 - Questioner: As for the second part, it says: If it occurs regarding the *ḥadīth* itself, and it happens that this *ḥadīth* came through several routes—So-and-so narrated from So-and-so through several routes—and it is found that this weak *ḥadīth* has several routes, it is said that this reaches the level of *ḥasan* (fair). Is this correct, O Shaykh?
The Shaykh: Yes, this is correct, but with some clarification and detail that is indispensable. Rather, I say it may reach the rank of *ṣaḥīḥ* (authentic), not just *ḥasan*. But we must explain the idea of the scholars who held this view, and then their basis for it.

P616a - Firstly: This absolute statement—meaning that a weak *ḥadīth* is strengthened by a multitude of routes—is not absolute. Rather, it has a restriction, which is: if the weakness of the routes is not severe. This requires an explanation in the terminology of the scholars of *ḥadīth*. What is the meaning of "the weakness of the routes did not become severe"? And what is the outcome of this condition?
Its outcome, very briefly and concisely, is that the weakness results from the poor memory of one of the narrators. Because this narrator with poor memory, if he is unique in narrating a *ḥadīth*, may have erred in it. Error is of types—and this is, of course, explained thoroughly in the books of *ḥadīth*—the narrator with poor memory might take a *ḥadīth* from the speech of a Companion, forget, and say, "The Messenger of Allah said." Or it might be the reverse: the *ḥadīth* is from the Companion from the Messenger of Allah, so he forgets and says, "The Companion So-and-so said," and so on. Examples are many.
So the condition here, "if its weakness is not severe," means these routes revolve around narrators who are all *thiqāt* (trustworthy), *ʿudūl* (upright), and *ṣāliḥīn* (righteous); they do not lie, but every route is not free of a man who has poor memory. In that case—it is theoretically true—it is possible for the one with poor memory to narrate a *ḥadīth* containing an error that has not been revealed to us. What should be our stance regarding his *ḥadīth*? We distance ourselves from it, because we do not narrate the *ḥadīth* nor attribute it to the Messenger unless we have a preponderance of thought (*ghalabat al-ẓann*) that he said it—as previously explained. The narration of one with poor memory regarding a weak *ḥadīth* does not achieve a preponderance of thought in the soul of the researcher that the Messenger said this; rather, the opposite.
Therefore, scholars avoid the *ḥadīth* of the *ṣadūq* (truthful one) with poor memory... it is not used as proof. However, a *ṣadūq* plus a *ṣadūq*—a second route, plus a *ṣadūq*—a third route, and count according to the *ḥadīth* and its routes; the doubt for which the scholars of *ḥadīth* did not use the *ḥadīth* of the one with poor memory disappears. Why does it disappear? Because how could this one err, and that one err, and that one err?

P616b - This is very remote.
Some scholars bring an example: If we assume that a proficient poet composed a poem, four or five verses. It is impossible for another poet to compose the meaning with the same wording used by the first poet. He might hum around the meaning but with different wording and rhyme. Thus, the meeting of a weak one with a weak one is as was said:
"Do not fight my heart with your two eyes * For two weak ones defeat a strong one."
If three or four of these weak ones gather, they give strength to this narration. Furthermore, the proof of the scholars for this rule, after clarifying it and stating the condition within it, is that Allah, Mighty and Majestic, made the testimony of two women equivalent to the testimony of one man, and He said in the stated justification: "Lest one of them errs, so the other reminds her" [Qurʾān 2:282]. So the testimony of a woman is half the testimony of a man, because the woman has specific conditions not like the man. So the Lord of the Worlds supported the weakness of the instinct found in the woman with the testimony of another woman. Thus, two women equal the testimony of one man. Therefore, two weak ones of the aforementioned type equal the narration of a *thiqah* (trustworthy person). With this condition, if the routes of a weak *ḥadīth* are numerous, and these routes are not severely weak, it moves to the rank of *ḥasan*. Rather, it may ascend to the rank of *ṣaḥīḥ* as the routes multiply, because the multiplication of routes strengthens the conjecture cast into the soul by the two or three routes.

P617 - Questioner: Now we stand at a report... We know that every author among these authors relied on a specific method in collecting *ḥadīth*. Al-Bukhārī relied on a specific method, and Muslim relied on a specific method, and so on. Now, I heard that you weakened two *ḥadīths* of al-Bukhārī. We want to know what *ḥadīth* was weakened? And why was it weakened?
The Shaykh: It was weakened because the error of one of the narrators was established. One of the two *ḥadīths* is the *ḥadīth* of Ibn ʿAbbās, and it is in the *Ṣaḥīḥayn* (the two Ṣaḥīḥs), not just in al-Bukhārī. He said: (The Messenger of Allah ﷺ married Maymūnah while he was a *muḥrim* [in a state of ritual sanctity]). Before I expand a little on the answer, I want to draw attention: someone like me might say, "I have the pride to weaken what Imam al-Bukhārī authenticated," but I do not have the right to say that, because I am preceded in such a thing by senior scholars. However, with deep regret—and this is the crux of this speech—due to the ignorance of the general students of knowledge, and even the scholars themselves regarding this science, and their lack of study of the books of the people of knowledge, when they hear "al-Albānī"—who is this al-Albānī? The *Aʿjamī* (foreigner) from Albania, who resided in Syria as long as Allah willed, then here—what power does he have to weaken *Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī*, which is a book the Ummah received with acceptance? But, I wonder, did the Ummah receive *Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī* and *Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim* with acceptance just as they received the Noble *muṣḥaf* (codex)?
Naturally no, in the sense: Is every letter in *Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī* like every letter in the Noble Qurʾān? No one dares to say this speech. But the unity of this acceptance in the hearts of people who have not studied *Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī* with a conscious scientific study stripped of unbridled emotions—which divert people from believing in scientific facts—is what makes them find it arrogant if it reaches them or they read in a book of al-Albānī's books that a *ḥadīth* of al-Bukhārī is not *ṣaḥīḥ*, despite it being in the *Ṣaḥīḥ*. But it is not I who said it; Imams said it. This specific *ḥadīth* was weakened by Ibn Taymiyyah, Ibn al-Qayyim al-Jawziyyah, and Imam Ibn Ḥajar al-ʿAsqalānī in *Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī*.
Questioner: In *Fatḥ al-Bārī*?
The Shaykh: In *Fatḥ al-Bārī*, yes.
Questioner: Ibn Ḥajar weakened it in *Fatḥ al-Bārī*?
The Shaykh: Yes, indeed. And likewise many scholars. The witness—we return now to say—Ibn ʿAbbās says regarding Maymūnah (that the Prophet ﷺ married her while he was a *muḥrim*). However, it has been authenticated through more than one route from Maymūnah herself that she said: (The Messenger of Allah ﷺ married me while he was *ḥalāl* [outside the state of ritual sanctity]). So what does the researcher do in this case?

P617a - Preponderance (*tarjīḥ*) is necessary. We returned to preponderance and found the narrations from Maymūnah herself, firstly, are not *gharīb* (strange/singular)—meaning a single narrator was not unique in narrating them. The *gharīb* *ḥadīth* according to the scholars of *ḥadīth* is that which a single narrator is unique in narrating, even if he is a *thiqah*. Therefore, they divide the *gharīb* into *ṣaḥīḥ* and *ḍaʿīf*, because by *gharīb* they mean the uniqueness of the narrator with it. If the unique narrator is a *thiqah*, a *ḥāfiẓ* (preserver), and precise, then his *ḥadīth* is *gharīb ṣaḥīḥ*. If he is weak, it is *gharīb* and *ḍaʿīf*. The *ḥadīth* of Ibn ʿAbbās is *gharīb*; no one narrated it from the Messenger of Allah except Ibn ʿAbbās. Then from Ibn ʿAbbās, ʿIkrimah narrated it, and I think he has corroborators, but Ibn ʿAbbās was unique in it [from the Prophet]. As for the *ḥadīth* of Maymūnah, it came through routes from her. So the scholars I pointed to, and others whom I do not recall now, preferred the narration of being *ḥalāl* by observing two things. One of them: relates to *gharābah* (strangeness) and the lack thereof—and I mentioned that just now. The other is that the narration that came through routes from Maymūnah is from Maymūnah herself, the owner of the relationship. She is more knowledgeable about herself than the one who narrates about her, who is Ibn ʿAbbās. So there is no strangeness here in saying that the *ḥadīth* of Ibn ʿAbbās, despite being in *Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī*, is *gharīb*, meaning *ḍaʿīf*. Not in terms of the narrators who narrated this *ḥadīth* in *Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī* being weak or liars, no, but rather that the narrator did not escape error, evidenced by the other routes that came from the owner of the story herself, Maymūnah, who said: (The Messenger of Allah ﷺ married me while he was *ḥalāl*).

P617b - As for the second *ḥadīth*, I think you mean his saying عَلَيْهِ السَّلَام—and it is in al-Bukhārī from the *ḥadīth* of... I do not remember who the Companion is—his saying عَلَيْهِ السَّلَام: (Verily, I will recognize my Ummah on the Day of Resurrection.) They said: "How, O Messenger of Allah?" He said: (They will come as *ghurran muḥajjalīn* [having white blazes on foreheads and white limbs] from the traces of *wuḍūʾ*; so whoever among you is able to extend his *ghurrah* [blaze], let him do so).
The *ḥadīth* without his saying: (So whoever among you is able to extend his *ghurrah*, let him do so) is *ṣaḥīḥ*. As for this addition, al-Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajar al-ʿAsqalānī and others call it—in *ḥadīth* terminology—an interpolated addition (*ziyādah mudrajah*), meaning it is not from the speech of the Messenger عَلَيْهِ السَّلَام; rather, it is from some of the narrators. Therefore, the *ḥadīth* ends at (*ghurran muḥajjalīn* from the traces of *wuḍūʾ*). As for the addition (So whoever among you is able to extend his *ghurrah*, let him do so), this is an addition from some of the narrators. Furthermore, in terms of meaning, it is not correct—as they explain that as well. Among their proofs for that: it implies that the Muslim, when he performs *wuḍūʾ*, instead of washing from here to here, he washes the front of the head to the bottom of the chin, and instead of washing to just an inch or two above the elbows, he reaches the upper arm and rolls up [his sleeve] like this. This is contrary to the *Sunnah*. It has come in the confirmed *ḥadīth* from the Messenger عَلَيْهِ السَّلَام in the *Musnad* of Imam Aḥmad and others (that he performed *wuḍūʾ* three times each, then said: Whoever increases upon this—meaning in quantity or quality—has transgressed and committed injustice). So increasing upon what the Messenger عَلَيْهِ السَّلَام brought is not permissible, because as you know, the best guidance is the guidance of Muḥammad ﷺ.
I feel a bit that this discussion is a bit academic, so I am waiting for other questions to move that front a little, never mind, haha.

P618 - Questioner: The brother asked you a while ago a question about shortening the prayer (*qaṣr*).
Questioner: The maximum limit for shortening the prayer, meaning, for example, I know that it is permissible for six months if I am not a resident or am a traveler.
The Shaykh: As long as you are actually a traveler, there is no limit for this to end. If you cease being a traveler, you have returned to the state of residence and the rulings of residence. If you remain a traveler, not just six months—it could be a year. But it has formed in your mind that these six months are an authentic narration from ʿAbd Allāh b. ʿUmar b. al-Khaṭṭāb, may Allah be pleased with him, that he went out as a warrior with his companions to Azerbaijan—which is on the borders of Iran now—and very heavy rains fell, so they remained shortening [prayers] for six months. But, I wonder, if the snows remained as they were and blocked the roads for them for another month, the six months would become seven, and so on. The important point is, if the traveler is still engaged in the status of travel according to the *Sharīʿah*, the rulings of the traveler apply to him, whether the period is long or short. That [status ending] only happens if he intends residence (*iqāmah*), meaning as they say: he resolves to reside; meaning he lives there. He is not forced to live there as happened to the Companions, no. Among his reasons is that he is working—the day ends, tomorrow his trade ends, his business is resolved, and so on—this one continues to shorten no matter how long the distance [or time] is. In short, there is no specific, named period for this duration.
We did not mention in the previous *ḥadīth* his saying, upon him be peace: (It is a charity Allah has bestowed upon you, so accept His charity). Go ahead.

P619 - Questioner: You graciously said that if he is returning, meaning... but if he returns... for example, like one who goes on a course, traveling for a period of six months or seven months. Is it his right to shorten? And this one, he does not know if he will return after six months, or must he reside in the foreign country for six months or a year?
The Shaykh: No, this one has resolved to reside for this duration—as you imagine now—so this one completes [the prayers] and does not shorten. This one has determined to reside... this one has settled, this is a resident. Perhaps you heard me say...
Questioner: Pardon me, if I may complete the question as well.
The Shaykh: Go ahead.
Questioner: As long as these are called "tours," meaning he goes on a tour of six months, three months, or two weeks, or such; they go on tours. Is this considered a known duration so he does not shorten? Or is it an unknown duration and he shortens?
The Shaykh: This, may Allah bless you, is not exactly the [same] question. This is a second question. Do not confuse us, haha. The first question was clear and the answer likewise. Now the question is a second question, and the answer is second and different, opposing the first. This one is a traveler now; this one is roaming, moving. So he continues to shorten until he returns to his country. The ruling differs completely.
Questioner: Meaning if he was traveling from one land to another, and it is possible he resides there for three days also, or a week. Is he considered a resident or considered a traveler?
The Shaykh: No, intending to settle... The first question was based on it being a "course." I heard him saying it. So he intends to settle. This one does not intend to settle; he intends to move. Here three days, there five, less, more, etc. This situation differs completely from the first situation; so he is a traveler.

P620 - Questioner: It is true, my question wanted the same question. Is the wisdom (*ḥikmah*) behind it facilitating matters for the Muslim? Suppose the Muslim was able to pray; is it not better for him to do it [completely]?
The Shaykh: No, may Allah bless you. In the issue, we must distinguish between the wisdom of a thing and the legal cause (*ʿillah*) of a thing, or the wisdom of the ruling and the cause of the ruling. If we know by some path that a certain ruling's cause is such-and-such, then if the cause disappears, the ruling disappears. Therefore, the scholars of *Uṣūl* (Principles of Jurisprudence) say: "The cause revolves with the effect in existence and non-existence; if the cause disappears, the effect disappears." A clear example for them is wine (*khamr*); every human knows the cause of the prohibition of wine is intoxication. So if the wine turns into vinegar, the cause departs; so it becomes permissible after it was forbidden. Likewise, for example, *maytah* (carrion/dead meat) is *ḥarām* (forbidden) to eat. If it transforms into an essence—into another reality—you look at this reality: Is it, in the judgment of the *Sharīʿah*, *ḥalāl* or *ḥarām*? It is known to all of you that *maytah*, due to natural factors of sun, wind, and rain, and the changing of atmospheres upon this *maytah*, turns into salt. I wonder, do we look at the origin of this salt and forbid it because the origin is *ḥarām*? Or do we say no, the salt is *ḥalāl*? We say: Yes, the cause disappeared, which was its being a carcass and *maytah*, and this has transformed into something else completely. If we know the cause of the thing, then we say: "If the cause disappears, the effect disappears."
I wonder, what is the cause of the command to shorten the prayer? Is it alleviation and facilitation, as you said? Or is it something else?
We say: The cause is not facilitation for the people, in the sense that if there is no hardship, one completes. No. Rather, as the scholars rightly say, "The cause is the presumption (*maẓinnah*) that travel is a hardship." The presumption of a thing being a hardship is different from the cause being the hardship itself. If the cause were hardship, then a person traveled and rested—perhaps some people, especially if they were, for example, poor, and an opportunity arose for them to stay in a hotel that they wouldn't see in a dream, so he rested in it while being a traveler; this is easy for him. So does he shorten or complete? If we said the cause of the command to shorten is hardship, the cause disappeared here, so the effect disappeared. But the cause is not hardship; rather, it is the *presumption* of hardship. This is a matter many people sense completely—this difference. You might travel and fast in Ramaḍān, for example, and say, "By Allah, I see myself completely comfortable," then suddenly during the journey, you feel that you need a drink, for example. So here appears the difference between travel being a presumption of hardship. Therefore, the Muslim must adhere to the ruling as it came, as long as it is not causally linked to hardship.

P620a - Add to that: if he had a choice, the Wise Lawgiver would not have differentiated between prayer and fasting. In prayer, He commanded shortening. In fasting, He said explicitly, as in *Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim*: (That a man from the Companions named ʿAmr b. Ḥamzah—ʿAmr al-Aslamī—came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and said: "O Messenger of Allah, I am a man of many travels in the month of Ramaḍān, so shall I fast?" He said: "If you wish, fast; and if you wish, break the fast.") Likewise, it came in the *Ṣaḥīḥayn* from the *ḥadīth* of Anas b. Mālik and others that the Prophet ﷺ traveled in Ramaḍān, and many of the Companions traveled with him. Among them was Anas, who said: (So among us was the faster and among us was the one breaking fast; the faster did not criticize the one breaking fast, nor the one breaking fast the faster). This is the ruling of fasting in Ramaḍān; he has the choice.
As for prayer—as you heard just now—[...] that the Messenger, when he went out for the Farewell Pilgrimage (*Ḥajjat al-Wadāʿ*), from the hour he left al-Madīnah, he shortened until he returned to it. All his travels were like this; he did not complete [prayer] except once, and his Companions likewise shortened with him.
In addition to that, *ḥadīths* confirm the obligation of shortening, among them: (It is a charity Allah has bestowed upon you, so accept His charity).

P621 - Questioner: You said that Ibn ʿArabī and the extremists of the Sufis...
The Shaykh: Are among those who advocate *waḥdat al-wujūd* (the unity of existence).
Questioner: They advocate *waḥdat al-wujūd*. The meaning of the speech is that there are moderates among the Sufis who did not advocate *waḥdat al-wujūd*.
The Shaykh: Yes, pardon—moderate in relation to him, not in relation to the *Sunnah*. I do not know, is this answer sufficient or not?
Questioner: No, it is not sufficient. Clarification.
The Shaykh: Deviation from the *Sunnah* has very many aspects.
Questioner: Meaning there are those among them who asserted the non-existence of *waḥdat al-wujūd*?
The Shaykh: Definitely. How not? For example, like al-Junayd; he does not advocate *waḥdat al-wujūd*.
The Shaykh: ʿAbd al-Qādir al-Jīlānī also does not advocate it, and he is a great figure in Ḥanbalī *fiqh* (jurisprudence). Many, rather most of them, do not advocate—and praise be to Allah—*waḥdat al-wujūd*. However, Ibn ʿArabī and ʿAbd al-Ghanī al-Nābulusī, the son of our city here in Damascus... yes indeed, these ones advocate *waḥdat al-wujūd*. It suffices you as a title that Ibn ʿArabī, in the introduction of his book—great in volume, not in worth—called *al-Futūḥāt al-Makkiyyah*, recites poetry. He is, glory be to Allah, a literary man, a literary man in the full sense of the word. He speaks of very deep unseen matters, but his Arabic speech is smooth. Look at his poetry now, alongside his misguidance:
"The slave is Lord and the Lord is slave * If only I knew who is the one charged [with duties]?
If I say 'slave,' that is a negation * Or if I say 'Lord,' how can He be charged?"
*Waḥdat al-wujūd*. "If I say 'slave,' that is a negation"—there is no slave. He says in his commentary: "Everything you see with your eye is Allah; there is no slave; there is no slave and Lord." Therefore, they do not say "Lā ilāha illā Allāh" (There is no deity except Allah) as the Muslims say and as the Noble Qurʾān says. [They say:] "Lā huwa illā huwa" (There is no He except He). This is their *dhikr*. If they abbreviate, the issue reaches "Huwa Huwa" (He, He). There is no other than Him. Even among the expressions known among us in the colloquial of al-Shām (the Levant), one says: "Mā fī ghayruh" (There is no one other than Him). He does not mean that exact meaning; he means there is no one other than Him... meaning as the existence of the Truth, meaning as the scholars say: The Necessary of Existence (*Wājib al-Wujūd*). But it stems from that turbid source: that it is Him and that's it, there is no one else.

P621a - So the witness is that most of the Sufis, praise be to Allah, do not say it. However, the Sufis in general deviate in behavior (*sulūk*). They deviate, for example, in their extremism in asceticism (*zuhd*) and their turning away from the world. Sometimes extremism reaches with them into issues related to creed (*ʿaqīdah*), but not from the perspective of *waḥdat al-wujūd*. They say to you, for example, "Knowledge is a veil (*ḥijāb*)." Knowledge among people—the jurists, the scholars—is light; they say it is a veil. They mean a veil from their deviation to which they deviate.
Exaggeration in asceticism—very many stories are mentioned in the book *Rawḍat al-Riyāḥīn fī Ḥikāyāt al-Ṣāliḥīn* by one of the late scholars—about two hundred years ago roughly. He narrates strange things there about asceticism. I have some summaries remaining with me. One of them, for example, submerges into the worm-infested water on a cold day, on a cold night, and goes up to the roof of the house. He soaks a burlap sack, submerges it well in water, and puts it on his body in this cold weather while the winds storm against him. Why? He said: "To discipline the soul (*tahdhīb*), to train the soul." This is torturing the soul, and this is forbidden Islamically.
Questioner: Brahminism.
The Shaykh: Brahminism, you have spoken well. One of them desires something so he does not eat it. They say to him, "Why? Are you unable?" He says: "No, just to coerce the soul." Well, this human has rights. The human is not an angel/king (*malak*); Allah printed him with instincts. These instincts require satisfaction. Among them, for example—and no offense—is sexual intercourse. So there is no monasticism in Islām. Yet some of them practice monasticism. Why? They narrate a *ḥadīth* in this regard—and praise be to Allah it is a fabricated (*mawḍūʿ*) *ḥadīth*: (Knowledge was lost between the thighs of women). So they practice monasticism so as not to be lost between the thighs of women. Well, the Messenger, upon him be peace, is your role model, you claim. So why do you not speak by his speech nor act by his action? He did not just marry four; he married nine, he married eleven, but he died leaving nine. However, he made the ruling specific for the general people that one marries only up to the fourth, while you [marry] not even one. Was the guidance of the Messenger to his Ummah and his leading them flawed?

P621b - So that you come and complete it? Yet he is the one who says, as in *Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī* and *Muslim*, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: (O assembly of young men, whoever among you can afford the *bāʾah* [ability to marry], let him marry, for it is more lowering for the gaze and more guarding for the private parts. And whoever cannot, then upon him is fasting, for it is a shield [*wijāʾ*] for him). So whoever cannot, upon him is fasting. Then if they fasted, they opposed the *Sunnah*; they fasted the fast of *wiṣāl* (continuity). The Messenger of Allah ﷺ forbade *wiṣāl*, which is to follow the day with the night. If he ate *suḥūr* (pre-dawn meal), for example, one day, he doesn't take it [again]; the early evening comes and he doesn't eat; so to the second *suḥūr*, he doesn't take *suḥūr*; so to the next evening, and so on, until he becomes a bone. Why? He wants to train his soul.

P621c - But the Master of Trainers did not teach us to train our souls like this. So they went to extremes in behavior in the name of training souls, and they trod the path of non-Muslims, like the Brahmin.
Questioner: ... these ones, none of them held fast to the Book and the *Sunnah*.
The Shaykh: How? I mentioned to you just now ʿAbd al-Qādir al-Jīlānī.
Questioner: Following (*ittibāʿ*)?
The Shaykh: No, no. *Ittibāʿ*, we are not talking about it. *Ittibāʿ*... just as the followers of Muḥammad ﷺ acted, the followers of al-Jīlānī acted, more and more. Do you believe that the followers of Muḥammad عَلَيْهِ السَّلَام who came after him marched on his march? Naturally no, and here we are living now.
Questioner: Pardon me, O Shaykh.
The Shaykh: Yes.
Questioner: The same subject of Sufism.
Questioner: Yes, this same subject... may have leaked into Islām from other religions. For example, the issue of *waḥdat al-wujūd*. *Waḥdat al-wujūd*—in my personal opinion, of course, I may be mistaken—is exactly like the issue of Incarnation (*tajsīd*) which the innovators or the Christians speak of. That Allah, Glorified and Exalted—of course, according to their claim—became incarnate in the person of the Master Messiah. Of course, people say He became incarnate in him while he was in the cradle, and became incarnate in him after he became ten years old, and became incarnate in him after he became thirty years old. The issue of Incarnation among the Christians—that God became incarnate—resembles exactly the issue you graciously explained, where he said the slave is the Lord and the Lord is the slave, according to his claim. I believe—meaning I believe—it is exactly similar or there is a fine thread between them. It is as if some religions or some other ideas leaked to these people, and they tried to attribute them to Islām. What you graciously mentioned regarding the issue of torturing the soul, the one who submerges himself in water and goes up top, exactly resembles the Indian religion of Buddha, of the Brahmins. It does not differ from it at all, just an attempt to wear an Islamic robe, regrettably. Do you not believe that these people—whether they understand or do not understand—transferred some other religions and tried to apply them in Islām? Allah knows best, it might be more...
The Shaykh: This is correct, but I say to you—and no offense—what is the benefit if this misguidance stems from themselves or if they were transmitters from others? This misguidance, whether it was like this or like that, our duty is to know it and avoid it, as was said:
"I knew evil not for evil's sake, but to guard against it * And whoever does not know evil from good falls into it."

P621d - But for the sake of history now, and precision: there is no need for it [the distinction] as long as it is all misguidance. Ibn ʿArabī the indeterminate [reference to "the N" in Ibn] disagrees with you in what you said, because he says in his book: "The Jews and Christians only went astray because they restricted God to a person. The Jews restricted God to ʿUzayr, and the Christians restricted God to ʿĪsā." He said about himself: "As for us, we have generalized Him in everything." So he is refuting you now, haha.
Questioner: ... called it Incarnation (*tajsīd*), called it *waḥdat al-wujūd*, called it Indwelling (*ḥulūl*).
The Shaykh: Look, O Professor, the scholars have two things: they have *waḥdat al-wujūd* and they have *ḥulūl*, as the brother said. There is no doubt that in terms of reality, there is a difference between the two creeds, or two thoughts, or two opinions. But both of them spring from what? From misguidance, which is *kufr* (disbelief).
Questioner: *Waḥdat al-wujūd* and *ḥulūl* and... the essence is one. *Ḥulūl* is the original Indian Hindu religion... it dwells from one to one to the end. And from this, they have the prohibition of eating animal meat because the soul of a human dwelt in it, and so on. So I believe the matter, it is even said that this Indian religion is what leaked into Christianity...
The Shaykh: Misguidance alone, we agree with you. But in terms of the idea and creed, it is very different. The proponents of *waḥdat al-wujūd* like Ibn ʿArabī do not believe that there is a Creator and a created. The proponents of *ḥulūl* say there is a Creator and a created, and that the Creator dwells in whom He chooses of His creation. So there is a very big difference. But in reality—and no offense if I say to you—wasting time in such philosophy... what do we have to do with these details? It is all misguidance; the matter is ended. There is no deity except Allah, and that's it. Yes.

P622 - Questioner: Religious *tawāshīḥ* (hymns) and group *dhikr* (remembrance) with a loud voice accompanied by swaying are called the *ḥaḍrah*. Are these practices acceptable in the Islamic *Sharīʿah* or unacceptable?
The Shaykh: No. If we look at what we said just now: "And follows other than the way of the Believers" [Qurʾān 4:115], we understand that these practices contradict the way of the Believers. Because undoubtedly, every scholar who has studied the biography of the Messenger عَلَيْهِ السَّلَام and his Noble Companions—whether in his time or after his death عَلَيْهِ الصَّلَاة وَالسَّلَام—knows with certainty that these Companions did not used to remember Allah in this manner in which the people of circles and *nawbāt* remember Him. Do you use the word *nawbāt* here?
The Audience: The *ḥaḍrāt*.
The Shaykh: But the word *nawbāt* is used among us in Syria, and it is more appropriate for them, because *nawbāt* is the plural of *nawbah* (fit/seizure/turn), haha. So the intent is that these circles and these *ḥaḍrāt* certainly did not exist in the era of the Messenger عَلَيْهِ السَّلَام. Therefore, the scholars of the Muslims—the jurists among them—went to great lengths in denouncing these people who remember Allah, Mighty and Majestic, with such remembrance which neither transmission (*naql*) nor reason (*ʿaql*) accepts. As for transmission: Our Lord, Mighty and Majestic, commanded us to honor His Prophet, exalt him, and revere him, and he is a slave among His chosen, excellent slaves. I wonder, what should be the stance of the slave with the Lord? Undoubtedly, he will revere Him; there is no reverence for anyone after Him, because He is the Creator of all and everything. If the matter is so, the Companions did not used to raise their voices in *dhikr*; not in circles like this nor in mosques. Rather, in the desert, in the open. It has come in *Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī* and *Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim* from the *ḥadīth* of Abū Mūsā al-Ashʿarī, may Allah be pleased with [him], who said: (We were on a journey with the Prophet ﷺ; whenever we ascended a mountain, we said *Allāhu Akbar*, and whenever we descended a valley, we said *Subḥān Allāh*, and we raised our voices. So he said عَلَيْهِ الصَّلَاة وَالسَّلَام: "Have mercy on yourselves! Verily, you are not calling upon a deaf one nor an absent one. Verily, you are calling upon a Hearing, Near One. And the One you are calling upon is closer to one of you than the neck of the riding beast of one of you." Then he turned to me and said, "O Abū Mūsā, shall I not guide you to a treasure from the treasures of Paradise? Say: *Lā ḥawla wa-lā quwwata illā bi-Allāh* [There is no change and no power except by Allah]"). *Lā ḥawla wa-lā quwwata illā bi-Allāh* is a treasure from the treasures of Paradise. If the Messenger, صَلَوَاتُ اللَّهِ وَسَلَامُهُ عَلَيْهِ, forbids his Companions from raising their voices in the desert, with a legal cause: "Verily, the One you call upon is not deaf nor absent"—to the end of the *ḥadīth*. I wonder, what would the Messenger عَلَيْهِ السَّلَام say to these people who raise their voices with the remembrance of Allah in the houses of Allah?
