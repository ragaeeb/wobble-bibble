Observed failure:
- "The Shaykh:\nIndeed, all praise is for Allah"
    - Unnecessary line break after the Shaykh: which was not present in the Arabic.
    - This only seems to have happened here, later it did not make this same mistake again.

- "scholars of al-salafīyyah and its callers"
    - Violated rule: "Proper Names", Salafīyyah should have been in capitals.
    - It did not make this same mistake again after this.

- "stipulating in Ḥajj and ʿUmrah: Allāhumma maḥillī ḥaythu ḥabastanī;"
    - The supplication should have been translated at least once in the response after the transliteration.

- "meaning, you ask about a ḥadīth (generic): “lā yarqūn wa-lā yastarqun.”"
    - Should have translated it at least once in the response after the transliteration.

    - Should have translated it at least once in the response after the transliteration.
