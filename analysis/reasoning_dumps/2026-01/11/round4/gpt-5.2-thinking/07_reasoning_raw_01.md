Translating terms with care
They're asking for literal translations of polemical terms, so "Kuffār" becomes "disbelievers." It's a common noun, so translating directly works without needing transliteration. For specific terms like “al-daʿwah al-salafīyyah,” I'll stick with transliteration because it’s required in the guidelines.

Transliteration rules and exceptions
The rule is to transliterate proper names or groups, so "al-daʿwah al-salafīyyah" stays as it is, as it’s a designated movement name. "Salaf" stays transliterated, not translated as "ancestors." For terms like "Sunnah" and "bidʿah," transliterate initially, then use the English equivalent in subsequent references, per the guidelines.

Following glossary and segmentation rules
For terms like "bidʿah" and "ḍalālah," I’ll follow the rule of using transliterations with English definitions on the first occurrence in each segment, then switching to the English term. Arab script excluding ﷺ won’t appear, but Qurʾānic translations will be in quotes. I'll also ensure proper segmentation and clear formatting for dialogue.

Translating and formatting proper names and terms
I’ll follow the instructions to translate terms like “هدول” as “these” while reflecting the colloquial usage. When transliterating names like “ʿAbd Allāh b. ʿUmar b. al-Khaṭṭāb,” I’ll use the proper connectors like "b.". I’ll ensure titles like "Shaykh al-Islām" keep the fixed transliteration, and terms like "Qurʾān" and "muṣḥaf" follow the guideline too.

Following rules for terminology and translation
I’ll ensure terms like "muṣḥaf (codex)" and "ḥadīth (generic)" are consistently used as per the locked glossary anchors, even beyond their first occurrence. Since these anchors override other rules, I'll always use the pair form. For phrases like "Sunnah," I’ll follow the guideline to use "Sunnah corpus" and translate hadith texts accurately while preserving their meaning.

Following translation rules and formatting
I need to translate the bracketed note directly as it is part of the content: "[and the beginning of the answer is truncated]." For verses, quotes, and references like Qurʾān or poetry, I'll translate these into English, keeping any punctuation marks like « » intact. I must be careful with formatting (no Arabic script except ﷺ) and ensure I follow guidelines on diacritics, capitalization, and proper names like "Ḥijjat al-Wadāʿ." Key segments need to be handled one by one while adhering strictly to the rules.

Translating specific terms carefully
For P1, I'll start the translation with "The Shaykh:" and keep the structure simple, following the exact phrasing. I'll use "Muḥammad ﷺ" whenever there's a full salutation phrase after the Prophet's name. For technical terms like "ṣaḥīḥ (authentic)", I'll follow the glossary guidance to ensure clarity, using transliteration when needed, especially for grading terms. I'll also keep quotes translated exactly.

Translating with consistency and accuracy
For terms like "ḍaʿīf (weak)" and "ṣaḥīḥ (authentic)", I'll maintain the glossary's pairing throughout. I'll translate "بدعة" as "bidʿah (innovation)" and "محدثة" as "newly-introduced matter". For quotes, such as from Ibn Taymiyyah, I'll translate directly without paraphrasing. I'll also ensure "Jahannam" is kept as is and apply the right phrasing for hadith-based sections.

Translating terms and names carefully
For "Jahannam,” I’ll treat it as a proper name without parentheses. The typo "يجوى" will be translated as "to be saved" though it's uncertain; I must stick with the exact wording. I'll transliterate "Islām" correctly, and "Sībawayh" as per ALA-LC. I'll also preserve quotes accurately, such as "Report is not like eyewitnessing".

Translating terms with precision
I’ll translate "اشتاق لها" as "and she longs for her" literally. To address the "khimār" term, since it’s defined as "covering of the face and hands" in context, I’ll use "khimār (covering of the face and the hands)" in the translation. As for the ruling, "not obligatory, but recommended" fits the meaning of "غير واجب، لكنه مستحب".

Addressing legal terms and transliterations
For legal recommendations, I’ll use "recommended" instead of "sunnah" for clarity.

When translating terms like "الإيشارب" (scarf), I’ll use "īshārib (scarf)" for the first occurrence, then just "scarf." For terms like "khimār," "junub" (major ritual impurity), and hadith references, I’ll follow the transliteration rules carefully and stay consistent throughout. I'll clarify concepts like "munkar (denounced)" where necessary.

Translating and maintaining accuracy with terms
For terms like "miḥrāb," I’ll use "miḥrāb (place of prayer)" initially, and later just "miḥrāb." When quoting famous figures like al-Suyūṭī, I’ll use proper transliterations like "ḥāfiẓ (hadith memorizer)." I’ll handle Arabic phrases in context, like supplications, with transliteration and translation, avoiding any format restructures, while following guidelines for parentheses and punctuation.

Managing Arabic terms and their translation
I'll carefully transliterate terms like "ḥāfiẓ," "Ahl al-Sunnah wa-l-Jamāʿah," and "Zaydiyyah" without adding unnecessary parentheses. Some terms like "ḥajj mufrad" will be transliterated, followed by explanatory translations when appropriate. When discussing hadiths or Qur'an verses, I'll maintain their structure and punctuation, while also respecting segment ID requirements.
