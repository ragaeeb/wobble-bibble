P1 - The Shaykh:
Indeed, all praise is for Allah. We praise Him, seek His help, and seek His forgiveness. We seek refuge in Allah from the evils of ourselves and from the evil consequences of our deeds. Whomsoever Allah guides, none can mislead him; and whomsoever He misleads, none can guide him. And I testify that there is no deity except Allah alone, with no partner, and I testify that Muḥammad is His slave and His Messenger. To proceed:
Indeed, the best speech is the speech of Allah, and the best guidance is the guidance of Muḥammad ﷺ. And the worst matters are their newly-introduced ones; and every newly-introduced matter is bidʿah (innovation), and every innovation is misguidance, and every misguidance is in the Fire.

P1a - Perhaps all the brothers present know, from the indication of this ḥadīth (generic) and those like it—of what is established in the books of the Sunnah, with a ṣaḥīḥ (authentic) isnād (chain of narration) to the Prophet ﷺ—such as the ḥadīth (generic) of ʿĀʾishah: “Whoever introduces into this affair of ours that which is not from it, then it is rejected,” and the ḥadīth (generic) of al-ʿIrbaḍ b. Sāriyah, may Allah, Exalted and Most High, be pleased with him, who said: “Messenger of Allah ﷺ admonished us with an admonition from which hearts trembled and eyes shed tears, so we said: O Messenger of Allah, advise us.” He said: “I advise you to have taqwā of Allah, and to hear and obey even if an Abyssinian slave is placed in authority over you. Indeed, whoever lives from among you will see much disagreement. So adhere to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the Rightly Guided Caliphs after me. Bite onto it with the molars, and beware of newly-introduced matters. Every newly-introduced matter is bidʿah (innovation), and every innovation is misguidance.” These ḥadīth (generic) confirm what I suppose you understand and believe: that introducing innovations in the dīn (religion) is entirely misguidance—and I mean in the dīn, because the blameworthy innovation is specific to the dīn. As for worldly matters, among them is what is praiseworthy and among them is what is blameworthy, depending on this new matter: if it opposes the Law, it is blameworthy; and if it does not oppose the Law, then it is at least permissible. Among the finest things transmitted on this occasion is the statement of Shaykh al-Islām Ibn Taymiyyah, may Allah have mercy on him, for he laid down a very important principle, which he derived from these ḥadīth (generic), adding to them other texts that indicate that the basic principle regarding things is permissibility—this is a uṣūlī principle. So he, may Allah have mercy on him, said: “The principle in the dīn is prohibition except with a text, and the principle in the world is permissibility except with a text.” He means: every newly-introduced matter in the dīn is forbidden; as for what is newly introduced in worldly matters, it is permissible unless it opposes a text, as we mentioned. Then among what should be called attention to is that his ﷺ statement: “Beware of newly-introduced matters,” only means every act of worship introduced after the Prophet ﷺ—so it is misguidance, even if, in the view of many people, they reckon it to be good. And rightly did ʿAbd Allāh b. ʿUmar b. al-Khaṭṭāb, may Allah be pleased with him, say: “Every bidʿah (innovation) is misguidance, even if the people see it as good.” That is because deeming-good in the dīn means that this one who deems-good has made himself a counterpart alongside the Lord of the worlds, for none besides Him may legislate except what Allah, Mighty and Majestic, wills. For this reason, al-Shāfiʿī, may Allah have mercy on him, said: Whoever deems-good has legislated—because how can this one who deems-good know that what he deemed-good by his mind and thought alone, without deriving it from the Book of his Lord or from the Sunnah of his Prophet—how can he know that it is a good matter?!
For this reason, our stance, all of us, toward every newly-introduced matter in the dīn must be to refrain from it, by what has preceded of ṣaḥīḥ (authentic) ḥadīth (generic).

P2 - Questioner: Some of the brothers sitting hear about al-daʿwah al-salafīyyah by hearsay and read about it what is written by its opponents, not by its followers and callers. So it is requested from your eminence—while you are among the scholars of al-salafīyyah and its callers—to explain the position of al-salafīyyah among the Islamic groups today.
The Shaykh: I have answered the like of this question more than once, but there must be an answer since a question has been posed. So I say: a word of truth that no Muslim can dispute after the reality becomes clear to him:

P2a - First of that: al-daʿwah al-salafīyyah—attributed to what? Salafīyyah is attributed to the Salaf, so we must know who the Salaf are when the term “Salaf” is used among the scholars of the Muslims; then this attribution is understood, and its weight in its meaning and its indication. The Salaf are the people of the three generations for whom Messenger of Allah ﷺ testified to goodness in the ṣaḥīḥ (authentic), mutawātir ḥadīth (generic) recorded in the two Ṣaḥīḥs and elsewhere, from a group of the Companions, from the Prophet ﷺ, that he said: “The best of people are my generation, then those after them, then those after them.” These three generations whom the Messenger ﷺ testified to goodness—Salafīyyah belongs to this Salaf, and the Salafīs belong to these Salaf. If we know the meaning of the Salaf and Salafīyyah, then I say two matters:
The first matter: that this attribution is not an attribution to a person or persons, as are the attributions of other groups existing today on the Islamic earth. It is not an attribution to one person nor to dozens of persons; rather, this attribution is an attribution to infallibility, because it is impossible for the righteous Salaf to agree upon misguidance. Contrary to that is the Khalaf: the Khalaf have not come in the Law with praise for them; rather, blame has come regarding their multitudes. That is at the end of the previous ḥadīth (generic), where he ﷺ said: “Then after them will come people who will bear witness and will not be sought as witnesses…” to the end of the ḥadīth (generic). And he ﷺ indicated that in another ḥadīth (generic) in which there is praise for a group of Muslims and blame for their multitudes by the understanding of the ḥadīth (generic), where he ﷺ said: “A group from my ummah will not cease to be manifest upon the truth; those who oppose them will not harm them until the command of Allah comes,” or “until the Hour is established.” This ḥadīth (generic) singled out praise at the end of time for a group—and a group is the small congregation; in the language it can even apply to a single individual and above.
So, if we know this meaning in Salafīyyah—that it belongs to the congregation of the righteous Salaf, and that they are the infallibility when the Muslim holds fast to what these righteous Salaf were upon—then comes the second matter I alluded to earlier, namely: that every Muslim, when he knows this attribution and what it aims at regarding infallibility, it becomes impossible for him after this knowledge and clarification that— I do not say that—he disavows; that is obvious. Rather I say: it becomes impossible for him except that he be Salafī, because we understood that affiliating to Salafīyyah means affiliating to infallibility. From where did we take this infallibility?

P2b - We take it from a ḥadīth (generic) that some of the Khalaf use as evidence contrary to the truth—using it as evidence for taking the majority, of what the multitudes of the Khalaf are upon—when they cite his ﷺ statement: “My ummah will not agree upon misguidance.” It is not correct to apply this ḥadīth (generic) to the Khalaf today, given the deep-rooted disagreements between them. “My ummah will not agree upon misguidance” cannot be applied to the reality of the Muslims today, and this is a matter known to every student of this bad reality. Added to that are the ṣaḥīḥ (authentic) ḥadīth (generic) that came clarifying what occurred in those before us among the Jews and Christians and what will occur among the Muslims after the Messenger ﷺ in terms of splitting, for he ﷺ said: “The Jews split into seventy-one sects, and the Christians into seventy-two sects, and my ummah will split into seventy-three sects, all of them in the Fire except one.” They said: Who is it, O Messenger of Allah? He said: “It is the Jamāʿah.” This Jamāʿah is the Jamāʿah of the Messenger ﷺ; it is that which one can decisively apply to the previous ḥadīth (generic): “My ummah will not agree upon misguidance”—that what is meant by this ḥadīth (generic) are the Companions, whom the Messenger ﷺ judged to be the saved sect, and whoever follows their path and inclines toward their way. And these righteous Salaf are those regarding whom our Lord, Mighty and Majestic, warned us in the Qurʾān against opposing them and against taking a way other than their way, in His, Mighty and Majestic, statement: “And whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him and follows other than the way of the believers, We shall turn him to what he has turned and We shall burn him in Jahannam; and evil is the destination.” I have drawn the attention of our brothers on many occasions to the wisdom of our Lord, Mighty and Majestic, conjoining in this verse the statement: “and follows other than the way of the believers” with opposing the Messenger—what is the wisdom of that? Even though, if the verse were with the omission of this clause, if it were as follows: “And whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him, We shall turn him to what he has turned and We shall burn him in Jahannam; and evil is the destination,” it would have been sufficient as a warning and a rebuke of one who opposes the Messenger ﷺ and as a ruling upon him with his evil end. The verse was not like that; rather it added to that His, Mighty and Majestic, statement: “and follows other than the way of the believers.” Is this vain?!

P2c - Far be it for the speech of Allah, Mighty and Majestic, to be vain—meaning: whoever takes a way other than the way of the Companions, who are the infallibility in our earlier expression, and who are the Jamāʿah for whom the Messenger ﷺ testified that they are the saved sect, and whoever takes their way—these are those whose way it is not permissible for one who wants to be saved from the punishment of Allah on the Day of Resurrection to oppose. For that reason, He, Exalted, said: “And whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him and follows other than the way of the believers, We shall turn him to what he has turned and We shall burn him in Jahannam; and evil is the destination.”
So, the Muslims today at the end of time must know two matters:

P2d - First: who are the Muslims mentioned in this verse? Then what is the wisdom of hearing the Qurʾān and the ḥadīth (generic) of the Messenger ﷺ from him directly, and then not having the virtue of seeing the Messenger ﷺ apply the texts of the Book and the Sunnah as a practical application. And among the wisdom that is stated in the Sunnah is his ﷺ statement: “Report is not like eyewitnessing.” From it the poet began and from it he took his statement: “And no one who sees is like one who hears.” So those who did not witness the Messenger ﷺ are not like his Companions who saw and heard from him the speech directly and saw from him a practical application. Today there is a contemporary phrase coined by some Islamic callers, and it is a very beautiful phrase—but more beautiful than it is to make it a realized reality. They say in their lectures and admonitions and directions that we must make Islām a reality walking on the earth. Beautiful speech. But if we do not understand Islām in light of the understanding of the righteous Salaf as we say, we cannot realize this poetic beautiful speech: that we make Islām an actual, real reality walking on the earth. Those who were able to do that were the Companions of the Messenger ﷺ for the two reasons mentioned earlier: they heard speech from him directly, so they comprehended it better than anyone comprehended; then in matters there are that require practical clarification, so they saw the Messenger ﷺ clarify that for them by action. And I will give you a very clear example: there are verses in the Qurʾān that a Muslim cannot understand except if he knows the Sunnah that clarifies the Qurʾān, as He, Mighty and Majestic, said: “And We revealed to you the Reminder so that you may clarify to the people what was sent down to them.” For example, His, Exalted, statement: “As for the male thief and the female thief, cut off their hands.” Now bring me the Sībawayh of this era in the Arabic language—let him explain this noble verse for us. “As for the thief”—who is he? Linguistically he cannot determine the thief. And what is the hand? The Sībawayh of the end of time cannot give the answer to these two questions: who is the thief who deserves cutting of the hand, and what is the hand that should be cut for this thief?

P2e - Linguistically: if the thief stole an egg, he is a thief. And the hand: if it were cut here or here or at any place, it is a hand. But the answer is in what was mentioned in the previous verse: “And We revealed to you the Reminder so that you may clarify to the people what was sent down to them”—the answer is in clarification. There is clarification from the Messenger ﷺ of the Qurʾān, and this clarification he ﷺ applied in action regarding this verse in particular as an example, and regarding other verses in particular—and how many they are. Because one who reads in ʿilm al-uṣūl reads in ʿilm al-uṣūl that there is general and specific, and absolute and restricted, and abrogating and abrogated—comprehensive words under which enter dozens of texts, if we do not say: hundreds of texts. General texts that the Sunnah has presented—and I do not want to prolong this so that we can answer the rest of the questions.

P3 - Questioner: If the family refuses that their daughter visit a sister to her in Allah, and she longs for her and they always refuse this visit, does Islām permit her to go out to visit her without informing them of that? Or does she say to them something not true?
The Shaykh: It is not permissible for her to visit her without the permission of her parents, just as it is not permissible for her to lie to them. Rather, she must convince the parents that this visit the Wise Legislator commands. If they are convinced, then so be it; and if they are not convinced, then it is not permissible for the girl—especially if she claims that she is committed to the Law—to depart from obedience to her parents regarding such a visit.
Questioner: My teacher, regarding—likewise the lessons—does that apply to that? We are in a lesson, for example, an admonition in something?
The Shaykh: The same thing: permission is necessary.

P4 - Questioner: What is the ruling on wearing the khimār (covering of the face and the hands) at the present time? And if the girl feels temptation and chooses to wear it but the family refuses—especially the mother—then what does she do?
The Shaykh: If the refusal is limited to the face and the hands, then obeying the parents is required in that. But if the refusal includes more than that, then there is no obedience to a created being in disobedience to the Creator. Meaning: a woman must cover all of her body except the face and the hands. Covering them is not obligatory, but it is recommended. So if the parent is not pleased for their daughter to cover her face and hands, then there is no problem in obeying them, and there is no disobedience in that—unlike if they want her to uncover other than the face and the hands; then there is no obedience to them upon her, because that is disobedience.

P5 - The īshārib (scarf) is not sufficient. It must be a khimār (headcover) such that it covers the entire head and the neck and upper chest. The īshārib is not ample, and its covering is not sufficient.
Questioner: Does the covering, our teacher, include the shoulders as well?
The Shaykh: Yes; this is the khimār. The description of the khimār is that it is loose and wide: it covers the head and covers the shoulders. When we say it covers the neck and upper chest, then when it covers the neck and upper chest it covers the shoulders because it is wide. As for the īshārib, many times we see women with something of the neck appearing because of the īshārib, whereas the khimār covers the neck and the shoulders together. And Allah commanded that, saying: “and let them draw their khimārs over their bosoms.” As for the īshārib, this is from the category—as it is said today—of half-solutions, and in Islām there are no half-solutions.
Questioner: My teacher, many now from some—meaning—those committed, men and women, in the dīn and in their clothing, believe that the khimār is a covering of the face?
The Shaykh: This is ignorance of the language. The khimār is a covering of the head; for that reason a man “yaktamir,” meaning: he places the khimār on his head, and likewise the woman. For that reason He said: “and let them draw their khimārs over their bosoms.” If the khimār covered the face, He would not say “draw,” meaning: tighten it; rather, it would involve letting it hang down. This is ignorance of the language.

P6 - Questioner: If a woman wears a high heel in footwear, is that permissible for her? And what is the ruling?
The Shaykh: It is not permissible to imitate disbelieving women or immoral women. The origin of this is from Jewish women: in former times, before Islām, if one of them wanted to attend the gathering in which her lover would be, then so that he would see her, she would wear a type of high qabqāb (clog), so she would become tall and be seen. Then over time this became the shoe with the high heel. As for this shoe that makes the woman—meaning—her walk changes so that she inclines right and left: because of that the wicked disbelievers invented this type of footwear. So it is not fitting for the committed Muslim woman to wear footwear with a high heel, especially since in many instances it is the cause of her harm and her falling on the top of her head if she stumbles on the road for the slightest reason.

P7 - Questioner: Is it permissible to backbite the disbeliever and the polytheist? And is it permissible to insult them?
The Shaykh: All of that is permissible, because the disbeliever has no sanctity—unless there results from that a harm. For example: if he insults the disbeliever to his face or behind his back, and that reaches him, then perhaps he will insult the Muslim and insult his dīn and his Prophet, and so on. Then in that case, it becomes forbidden for the Muslim to insult the polytheist.

P8 - Questioner: In the verse: “none touch it except the purified,” what is meant by “the purified”—the believers or those in wuḍūʾ? And what is the ruling of not taking the Qurʾān to the lands of the disbelievers?
The Shaykh: What is meant by the verse is neither this nor that. Rather, what is meant are the angels. It is information from Allah, Mighty and Majestic, about the angels, and it is not this Qurʾān; rather, it is what is in al-lawḥ al-maḥfūẓ. So this muṣḥaf (codex) that is in al-lawḥ al-maḥfūẓ: “none touch it except the purified,” and they are the near angels. This is an informative statement, not a legislative statement—meaning: it issues a legal ruling. Allah is speaking about reality: that the Qurʾān—meaning what is in the hidden book, meaning al-lawḥ al-maḥfūẓ—this “none touch it except the purified,” and they are the near angels. As for the muṣḥaf (codex) that is in our hands, then the righteous and the wicked touch it, and the believer and the disbeliever. So our Lord, Mighty and Majestic, does not mean by this verse mankind at all, whether they are righteous or wicked; rather He means, as we said, the near angels.

P8a - As for traveling with the Qurʾān and the muṣḥaf (codex) to the land of the enemy, then it is not permissible unless one is secure that it will not be touched with harm and that it will not be humiliated. Then it is permissible, when we are secure it will not be humiliated, to bring the muṣḥaf (codex) into the lands of the disbelievers, so that perhaps they are able to read it and study it.

P9 - [and the beginning of the answer is truncated] For that reason he ﷺ said: “Every creation of Allah is beautiful.” Yes. A man or a woman whose eyebrow or her eyebrow is joined with the other—this is not possessed by the human; this is the creation of Allah, so we must be pleased with the creation of Allah, as He, Blessed and Exalted, said. Yes, he mentioned the verse. The point is that our Lord, Mighty and Majestic—now the verse came: “And your Lord creates what He wills and chooses; it was not for them the choice. Glorified is Allah, and Exalted above what they associate.” This is the answer to the last question.

P10 - Questioner: Shaykh ʿAlī Ḥasan al-Ḥalabī: Regarding reciting the Qurʾān and touching the muṣḥaf (codex) for the one in major ritual impurity—what is the ruling of that? And Ṭawāf of the House as well.
The Shaykh: And Ṭawāf of the House, yes.
Questioner: Shaykh ʿAlī b. Ḥasan al-Ḥalabī: Touching the muṣḥaf (codex) and reciting the Qurʾān—meaning—it is not a portion of a verse, nor for example seeking blessing or out of fear—something deliberate—and he touches the muṣḥaf (codex) and recites.
So what is the ruling of that as well? Give us a ruling—may Allah benefit you.
The Shaykh: May Allah bless everyone. We say: no doubt, the remembrance of Allah, Blessed and Exalted, has its sanctity and its inviolability. For that reason, it is agreed upon among the scholars of the Muslims that reciting the Qurʾān upon complete purity is best and is fitting for the greatness of the speech of Allah, Mighty and Majestic. And if it has been authentically established from the Prophet ﷺ that he refused to utter one of the names of Allah, Mighty and Majestic—namely al-Salām—except upon purity, in the well-known ḥadīth (generic) in the Sunan, such as Musnad Aḥmad and others: that a man gave greetings to the Prophet ﷺ, and he ﷺ did nothing except that he hastened to a wall, performed wuḍūʾ, and returned the greeting, and he said: “Indeed I disliked that I mention Allah except upon purity.” That he mention Allah, because al-Salām is a name from among the names of Allah—as also in the ṣaḥīḥ (authentic) ḥadīth (generic) in Kitāb al-Adab al-Mufrad of al-Bukhārī, from the ḥadīth (generic) of ʿAbd Allāh b. Masʿūd, who said: Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: “al-Salām is a name from among the names of Allah; He placed it on the earth, so spread it among yourselves.” This al-Salām—the Messenger ﷺ disliked to return it to the one who greeted him except upon purity.

P10a - As for reciting the Qurʾān while not in a state of purity—whether minor purity or major purity—then there is no evidence that forbids the Muslim to recite the Qurʾān while not in a state of purity. But this ḥadīth (generic) contains a very clear encouragement that he recite the Qurʾān while in complete purity. But here there is something: this ruling—namely, what is best, in the most complete, fullest form—not every legally responsible person among the Muslims is able to do it, except men only. As for women, then at times and at times. And earlier you heard the statement of the Messenger ﷺ to the lady ʿĀʾishah when she menstruated; he said to her: “Do what the pilgrim does, except do not perform Ṭawāf and do not pray.” Then it is not said to her: perform wuḍūʾ as we say to a man, because she cannot, legally, perform wuḍūʾ; she cannot, legally, purify herself. For that reason, she may recite whatever she wishes of the Qurʾān without us saying: outweighed and outweighing as we say regarding a man in major ritual impurity, for example. We say: he must perform ghusl, because he can perform ghusl, and by that he becomes purified, so we say: it is better for you to purify yourself. As for the menstruating woman, as for the woman in postpartum bleeding—wherein sometimes, in some women or in a type among women, forty days or more pass while she is in a state of postpartum bleeding—so it is said to her: do not recite! We have no evidence that prevents the Muslim in general—men, let alone women—from reciting the Qurʾān except upon purity. And the ḥadīth (generic) that al-Tirmidhī narrated in his Sunan, from the ḥadīth (generic) of Ibn ʿUmar, may Allah be pleased with him, who said: Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: “A menstruating woman and one in major ritual impurity do not recite the Qurʾān”—this is a munkar (denounced) ḥadīth (generic), as the Imām of the Sunnah Aḥmad b. Ḥanbal says. This ḥadīth (generic) is not authentic; if it were authentic, it would be obligatory to stop at it. In addition to the weakness of this ḥadīth (generic), and whatever may be in the chapter from its like among weak reports, we have the ḥadīth (generic) of the lady ʿĀʾishah, where he ﷺ commanded her and permitted her to do everything the pilgrim does except that she does not pray and does not perform Ṭawāf. Does the pilgrim not recite the Qurʾān? Rather, there is a season for reciting the Qurʾān, because there is free time and there is the pilgrim’s full turning to Allah, Blessed and Exalted. No doubt he recites the Qurʾān. So this ḥadīth (generic) contains a direct permission for the menstruating woman to recite the Qurʾān. So it is not permissible for us to prevent women from reciting the Qurʾān on the pretext that she is not in a state of purity. If Allah had prevented her, just as He prevented her from prayer, we would have stopped at this prevention and ended there. But we find that the Wise Legislator has inspired to the Noble Messenger a differentiation between prayer and the components of prayer, because some people say: O brother, recitation is a pillar from the pillars of prayer! So why do we not obligate purity for this recitation while it is a part from among the parts of prayer?

P10b - So we say: recitation is not the only part from among the parts of prayer. The first thing with which prayer is opened is our saying: Allah is greatest. So let us say: then it is not permissible for a Muslim to say “Allah is greatest” except upon purity, because it is a pillar from among the pillars of prayer. Likewise it would be said regarding tasbīḥ, taḥmīd, takbīr, and so on. There is no escape from that at all—while preserving what we mentioned: that it is better to remember Allah upon purity. Likewise it is said entirely regarding touching the Qurʾān: touching the Qurʾān is legislated. Reports came from some of the Companions that they would refrain in practice—not merely in thought—from touching the Qurʾān except upon wuḍūʾ. So this clarifies what is best for the one who wants to touch the Qurʾān or to recite the Qurʾān. As for obligating and saying that it is forbidden for the woman who is not in a state of purity—let alone the man—to touch the muṣḥaf (codex), then there is no evidence for that at all. And people, no doubt, imagine that there are proofs, but they are not proofs at all. Among that, for example, is what becomes confused to many people, especially those who have an attachment and attention to reciting the Qurʾān, when he reads the statement of Allah, Mighty and Majestic, in the Qurʾān: “none touch it except the purified.” The error in carrying this verse onto the topic we are in—meaning: interpreting His, Mighty and Majestic, statement “none touch it” as meaning this muṣḥaf (codex) that is in our hands, and “except the purified” as meaning those who have wuḍūʾ—this illusion has reached the point that it is printed on every copy that is printed in the Islamic world from the Qurʾān: the title “none touch it except the purified.” This is an error like another error, in terms of the intellectual, scholarly error first, and then in terms of its being spread and generalized among the people second. The verse that is written on the miḥrābs (place of prayer): “Whenever Zakariyyā entered upon her the miḥrāb, he found with her provision.” The miḥrāb is said to mean a niche—this is a lie; this is ignorance. What is meant by miḥrāb is the place of prayer: “Whenever Zakariyyā entered upon her the miḥrāb”—meaning: the room in which she was secluded from the people, worshipping Allah, Mighty and Majestic. This is the miḥrāb, not that the miḥrāb is this thing that was introduced into the mosques from old times, unfortunately, influenced by the miḥrābs of churches—the miḥrābs of the Christians in their churches. Otherwise, in Islām there is no miḥrāb. The mosque of the Messenger ﷺ did not have a miḥrāb. And for the well-known Egyptian ḥāfiẓ (hadith memorizer) al-Suyūṭī—al-Suyūṭī, the author of al-Jāmiʿ al-Kabīr and al-Jāmiʿ al-Ṣaghīr—there is a treatise; I may have forgotten its title—yes— Iʿlām al-Arīb; and this—meaning—is a very valuable study. He transmits there texts from the people of knowledge that the presence of miḥrābs in mosques is from the newly-introduced matters.

P10c - The point: the previous verse, “none touch it except the purified,” has no connection to the topic of touching the Qurʾān that is in our hands. This has a long explanation, which I will abridge as much as possible. So I say: “none touch it”—the pronoun here returns to the hidden book mentioned previously, because Allah, Mighty and Majestic, says: “none touch it except the purified,” returning to the hidden book. Our book—praise be to Allah—is not hidden. Because what does hidden mean? Meaning: concealed, preserved, meaning: you do not see it and the hands of devils do not reach it. For that reason, for Imām Mālik, may Allah have mercy on him, there is a good and very subtle understanding in his book al-Muwaṭṭaʾ in explaining this verse, where he says: The best I have heard regarding its explanation is that it is like the verse in Sūrat ʿAbasa: “No! Indeed it is a reminder. So whoever wills may remember it, in honored pages, exalted, purified, in the hands of scribes, noble, righteous.” Who are these scribes? The angels. These angels are themselves what is meant: that they touch it, and that others besides them do not touch that hidden book. This is one contextual indicator, and there are other indicators. Among the strongest of them: that He, Exalted, said: “except the purified.” We humans, it is not permissible for us to describe ourselves—no matter how high we are and how elevated we are in righteousness and taqwā—as “purified.” We are not “purified,” and it is not permissible for a human to be “purified” ever. Rather, we are polluted, and the righteous among us is the one who undertakes to purify himself. The righteous among us undertakes—meaning: he affects purity—otherwise it is not from his nature that he is pure. The purified are the angels described in the Qurʾān by His, Mighty and Majestic, statement: “they do not disobey Allah in what He commands them, and they do what they are commanded.” As for humans, they are those whom Allah, Mighty and Majestic, meant by His statement: “Indeed Allah loves those who repent, and He loves those who purify themselves.” Likewise, when He mentioned Masjid Qubāʾ, He said: “therein are men who love to purify themselves.” So if we are like them, then glad tidings to us: we purify ourselves. As for being purified—far, far.
So the point: using this verse as evidence and connecting it to this topic is a widespread error. Among the best who spoke on this verse, better than what we mentioned—and from it we derived—is the ʿallāmah Ibn al-Qayyim al-Jawziyyah, in his book Aqsām al-Qurʾān. There he expanded and did well. Perhaps in this there is sufficiency, if Allah wills.

P11 - Questioner: What is the ruling on stipulating in Ḥajj and ʿUmrah: Allāhumma maḥillī ḥaythu ḥabastanī; and what is required from the one who stipulates, in practice, to complete his rites?
The Shaykh: The ruling of stipulating is permissibility. Its fruit is that if the one who wants Ḥajj or ʿUmrah stipulates, then something befalls him that prevents him from completing the Ḥajj or the ʿUmrah—this is known in the language of the Law as iḥṣār (being prevented)—then “if you are prevented, then whatever sacrificial offering is easy.” This is an obligatory matter: everyone who is unable to complete the Ḥajj, then upon him is the sacrificial offering, and upon him is Ḥajj in the following year—unlike one who stipulated at the beginning of his iḥrām and said: Allāhumma maḥillī ḥaythu ḥabastanī. Then he is free from the obligation of repeating the Ḥajj that was blocked between him and it, and then the sacrificial offering is not required from him—unlike if he did not stipulate. This is what the Messenger ﷺ meant in the well-known ṣaḥīḥ (authentic) ḥadīth (generic) from him, namely his ﷺ statement: “Whoever is broken, or becomes ill, or becomes lame, then he has exited, and upon him is another Ḥajj in the following year.” This is if he did not stipulate. As for if he stipulated, then nothing is upon him at all—along with calling attention that repetition is upon him even if he had performed the obligatory Ḥajj, the Ḥajj of Islām. So if he did not stipulate and was prevented and was unable to continue the Ḥajj, then upon him, in the following year, is repetition of the Ḥajj even if he had performed the obligatory Ḥajj. This is the answer to what you asked.

P12 - The Shaykh: …meaning, you ask about a ḥadīth (generic): “lā yarqūn wa-lā yastarqun.” Here is a question that I will pose to you, along with its answer, if Allah wills, after I give a brief word about an etiquette from among the etiquettes of gatherings that is neglected today, especially by people—let alone their common folk. From these etiquettes is gathering, forming groups, and drawing close in the sitting, and not distancing in it. This is from the wisdoms of the Law in many of its apparent rulings, which have been explicitly stated in some ṣaḥīḥ (authentic) ḥadīth (generic). For example, in Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim there is the ḥadīth (generic) of Jābir b. Samurah— as I recall: that the Prophet ﷺ entered the mosque one day and saw them scattered, circle after circle, so he said to them: “Why do I see you in separate groups?

P12a - ” Meaning: scattered. And more important than this is what Imām Aḥmad narrates in his book al-Musnad with a strong isnād (chain of narration) from Abū Thaʿlabah al-Khushanī, may Allah be pleased with him. He said: When we traveled with the Prophet ﷺ and stopped, we would scatter in the mountain passes and valleys. So we traveled one day and stopped as we used to stop, and he ﷺ said to them: “Indeed your scattering in these mountain passes and valleys is only from the work of Shayṭān.” He said: After that, when we stopped in a place we gathered until, if we sat upon a mat, it would hold us. So what do you all think—uh—sitting here on a leveled, smoothed roof: this scattering is not from the Sunnah of Islām. For that reason, the more the circle draws close, the more it is encompassed by the mercy of Allah, Mighty and Majestic, and His bounty. And many people are ignorant that there is a very close connection between a person’s outward and his inward. And this close connection—many ḥadīth (generic) of the Messenger ﷺ have abundantly come indicating it. And perhaps you know the expression that is mentioned in many books: “the outward is the title of the inward.” This is what the poet indicated long ago when he said:
Whatever trait a man possesses—if he thinks it hidden from people, it will be known

P12b - There must be a connection between the outward and the inward. For that reason, the Messenger ﷺ took great care in rectifying the outward of the Muslims, let alone their inward. He ﷺ, just as he came with rectifying hearts and inner states, likewise came with rectifying bodies and outward states together. So it is not only as many people say: the consideration is what is in the inward. Yes, the consideration is what is in the inward, but that does not entail neglecting the outward. For that reason, he ﷺ said when he saw that man—or heard that man say—while the Messenger ﷺ was exhorting the people to obey Allah and to follow His Book: that man stood to say to him: What Allah wills and you will, O Messenger of Allah. So he ﷺ became extremely angry and said: “Say: what Allah alone wills.” This is an outward utterance that appeared from the tongue of that Companion by mistake. But this outward was contrary to his inward with certainty, because his inward was full of faith in Allah and His Messenger ﷺ. But when he erred in the wording, the Messenger ﷺ did not remain silent about him; rather he corrected his expression and said to him: “Say: what Allah alone wills.” The Messenger ﷺ knows with certainty that this man did not intend what his wording indicated: his wording indicated that he made the Messenger a partner with Allah in His will, Blessed and Exalted. But this Companion knows that the will of Allah, Blessed and Exalted, is before everything and above everything, because he reads in the Qurʾān: “and you do not will except that Allah wills, Lord of the worlds.” And no one thinks that this Companion was ignorant of this reality. But his tongue slipped; yet the Messenger ﷺ corrected it for him and directed him to what to say. He said to him: “Say: what Allah alone wills.” And in another narration: “what Allah wills, then you will.” The ḥadīth (generic) on this are many, and I am not now in the context of explaining them, because it is a word about gathering in the sitting and not scattering in it. But before I finish it, I find myself compelled to mention only one more ḥadīth (generic), for what it contains of wonder in the Messenger’s ﷺ concern for rectifying people’s expressions and their outward statements: namely his ﷺ statement: “Let none of you say: khabuthat nafsī; let none of you say: khabuthat nafsī; rather: laqisat.” What is the meaning of laqisat?

P12c - In the language it equals khabuthat; laqisat linguistically means khabuthat. But the word “vile” is vile, so the Messenger ﷺ did not want the Muslim to utter it when he finds in himself something of this vileness by the word “vileness”; rather, he turned him away from it to the word laqisat. And this word, by nature—and you are Arabs—you do not know it; but the master of Arabs and non-Arabs taught it to you and said: “Let none of you say: khabuthat nafsī; rather: laqisat.” This is in the Muslim’s being well-mannered with himself, because he is a Muslim. So how about being well-mannered with Allah and with His Prophet ﷺ?! Then more fitting that the Muslim be well-mannered with Allah, then with His Messenger ﷺ, and not come with an expression that may touch the station of Prophethood or the station of Messengership. Earlier—and the questioner should note this—there was a questioner who asked me privately, perhaps he said: Is it legislated or is it permissible for the one hearing the adhān to say…

P14 - Questioner: …while they are alive—so what is the ruling of the Law regarding that?
The Shaykh: If what is meant by distribution is gifting and giving, then that has its ruling. And if what is meant by it is dividing inheritance before its time arrives, then that has another ruling. Then for each of the two rulings there is an apportionment that differs from the apportionment of the other ruling. If the father wants, when he divides his wealth, to gift what he has of wealth to his children, then here comes his ﷺ statement: “Be just among your children.” So he must make equal here between male and female. As for if what is meant is dividing inheritance, then this is premature first, and then it may create dispute and disagreement among the children due to hastening the implementation of the ruling—this ruling whose time has not yet come—because inheritance only becomes realized by the death of the bequeather.

P15 - Questioner: Is the Messenger’s ﷺ visiting the graveyard at night something specific to him ﷺ?
The Shaykh: No, it is not specific to him.

P16 - Questioner: If al-Ḥākim in his al-Mustadrak says: This is a ḥadīth (generic) upon the criterion of al-Bukhārī and he did not narrate it, and al-Dhahabī approved that; or al-Dhahabī says about the ḥadīth (generic) that it is ṣaḥīḥ (authentic)—then is such a ḥadīth (generic) relied upon then? And is it used as proof as any ḥadīth (generic) in the al-Ṣaḥīḥayn is used as proof?
The Shaykh: Here the answer differs regarding the common people and regarding some of the elite—and by this some I mean: the scholars of ḥadīth (generic). As for the common people, their obligation—as we began in the word of this sitting—is to ask the people of knowledge. And there is no doubt that al-Ḥākim is from the people of knowledge in ḥadīth (generic), in declaring ṣaḥīḥ (authentic) and ḍaʿīf (weak), especially if we compare him to one who has no knowledge—I do not mean the common people, but rather the specialists of the end of time who do not study the science of ḥadīth (generic). So it is obligatory for them to refer to him and to look: what is his stance regarding the ḥadīth (generic)? If he declared it ṣaḥīḥ (authentic), they follow him, unless the error of al-Ḥākim becomes clear by the ruling of someone other than him who is more knowledgeable in the science of ḥadīth (generic) than him. So then, even more so, if al-Ḥākim declared a ḥadīth (generic) ṣaḥīḥ (authentic) and al-Dhahabī agreed with him, then upon the common Muslims is to follow that—unless it becomes clear to them, by a transmission from a scholar, that al-Ḥākim was mistaken and al-Dhahabī also followed him in his mistake; then one returns from following him or following them to following what is correct that became clear to him from other than them. As for the elite among the scholars of ḥadīth (generic), then by what they have of knowledge of the biographies of the narrators of the ḥadīth (generic) first, and what they have of knowledge of muṣṭalaḥ al-ḥadīth second—these are not obligated to follow al-Ḥākim, nor even al-Dhahabī, because it becomes clear to them in many instances that in their declaring things ṣaḥīḥ (authentic) there occurred much illusion and error. In summary: just as it is obligatory upon the common Muslims.
[cut in the tape],
in one case: when the error of that jurist becomes clear to them, or the error of that muḥaddith becomes clear, then error is not permissible to follow.

P17 - Questioner: In the same topic, teacher, how is the purging done? And what is considered a ḥadīth (generic) for some muḥaddithīn is considered a ḥasan (fair) ḥadīth (generic) for others, and what is considered bad for some is considered ḥasan (fair) or ḍaʿīf (weak) for others?
The Shaykh: This—no offense—is an old habit we know from Akhzamī. Purging: we mean what is possible of it. The weak and fabricated ḥadīth (generic) that are widespread in the books—that we mentioned—from books of tafsīr, ḥadīth (generic), sulūk, morals, and the like, are more than can be enumerated by the hundreds—rather, by the thousands. I am one person; the number of weak and fabricated ḥadīth (generic) with me up to now has reached close to above six thousand weak ḥadīth (generic)—I alone. So what do you imagine if in the Islamic world there were abundance and many from the people of knowledge who are specialized?! They would dig out such ḥadīth (generic) from the depths of books—many, many forms. So why do we come to some ḥadīth (generic) in which some scholars of ḥadīth (generic) differ, as some say: there are jurisprudential rulings as well in which some scholars differed. We say: there are issues; it is established with researchers in fiqh that they are errors opposing the Book and the Sunnah, so they must be purged and removed from the path of the jurists. Likewise there are ḥadīth (generic) agreed upon as being weak, rather as being fabricated, so they must be removed from the depths of books and from the minds of the students of knowledge, as well as the scholars. There remains, no doubt, some jurisprudential issues and some ḥadīth (generic) that are a place of disagreement. That something of that remains—such a question does not come, because we do not believe contrary to what is spread by some spiteful people or ignorant people: that we want to unify all madhhabs and make the four madhhabs one madhhab. We— I do not say: we are among the most knowledgeable people— we are among the most knowledgeable people that this is impossible: impossible to gather the people upon one madhhab; impossible to gather the people upon one thought. But it is not impossible to bring people closer, especially Ahl al-Sunnah wa-l-Jamāʿah. It is possible to bring closer—and this is real and witnessed. Those who study what is called today “comparative fiqh”—even though this study in the universities is still superficial, because the doctor specialized in sharīʿah and fiqh presents the issue, and the statements that were said regarding it, and the evidences of each, then leaves the students confused, not knowing what is correct among these statements—because he presented their evidences: there may be a general verse and a detailed ḥadīth (generic), but he does not say that this ḥadīth (generic) specifies the verse; there may be a madhhab that argues with an authentic ḥadīth (generic) and another with a weak ḥadīth (generic), but he does not attend to distinguishing the authentic from the weak, and so on. So he leaves what?

P17a - He leaves the students confused. For that reason I say: this comparative fiqh today is taught as a superficial study. Those who study it as a complete study such that—as they say today—they “put the dots on the letters,” they say: this evidence is such-and-such, and this evidence is such-and-such, and what is weightier is such-and-such, for such-and-such a reason—these know that those who follow this jurisprudential method—what is called comparative fiqh—bring the Muslims closer. And these are examples before our eyes existing today. Which student of knowledge does not hear of Imām al-Shawkānī? Which student of knowledge does not hear of al-Ṣanʿānī? Which person of knowledge does not hear of Ṣāliḥ al-Maqbalī, the author of al-ʿIlm al-Shāmikh fī Īthār al-Ḥaqq ʿalā al-Ābāʾ wa-l-Mashāyikh? Who does not hear of these? No one. Their origin is Zaydiyyah—Ziyūd. They are not Ḥanafī, nor Shāfiʿī, nor Mālikī, nor Ḥanbalī—meaning, by the expression of these four madhhabs, those Ziyūd are not from Ahl al-Sunnah wa-l-Jamāʿah. But when they followed this path that we call all Muslims to follow so that they draw close, show affection, and not distance and not hate, then there is realized in them what was realized in those imāms whom we mentioned: they became with us; they became Sunnīs; they became refuters of the Ziyūd, because they oppose the Sunnah. So this method reconciles and does not divide. As for each person remaining upon his madhhab, that is what divides and does not unify.

P18 - Questioner: Is it permissible that I perform ʿUmrah twice in one trip while I am from Jordan: the first time from Abyār ʿAlī and the second time from al-Tanʿīm, like ʿĀʾishah, may Allah be pleased with her? If it is not permissible, then is it permissible on behalf of my deceased father or on behalf of my mother? May Allah reward you with good.
The Shaykh: The one who wants to repeat ʿUmrah should return to the mīqāt from which he entered iḥrām—whether that is on behalf of himself or on behalf of his parents. As for entering iḥrām from al-Tanʿīm, from which the lady ʿĀʾishah entered iḥrām, then this is a ruling specific to ʿĀʾishah and whoever is like her. And I describe this ʿUmrah from al-Tanʿīm as the ʿUmrah of the menstruating woman. That is because ʿĀʾishah, may Allah be pleased with her, when she went out with the Prophet ﷺ as a pilgrim in Ḥijjat al-Wadāʿ, she had entered iḥrām for ʿUmrah. When she reached a place near Makkah, known as “Sariḥ,” the Messenger ﷺ came in upon her and found her weeping, so he said to her: “What is with you that you are weeping? Have you begun menstruation?” She said: Yes, O Messenger of Allah. He ﷺ said: “This is a matter Allah has written upon the daughters of Ādam. So do what the pilgrim does, except do not perform Ṭawāf and do not pray.” So she did not perform Ṭawāf and did not pray until she became pure in ʿArafāt; then she continued the rites of Ḥajj and performed the Ḥajj completely. When the Messenger ﷺ resolved to travel and return to al-Madīnah, he entered upon her in her tent and found her also weeping. He said: “What is with you?” She said: What is with me? People are returning with Ḥajj and ʿUmrah, and I return with Ḥajj without ʿUmrah—because due to her menstruation, her ʿUmrah turned into Ḥajj: a solitary Ḥajj. So she was then weeping in regret over what she missed of ʿUmrah before the Ḥajj, while her co-wives, like Umm Salamah and others, returned with ʿUmrah and Ḥajj. So she wept, saying: What is with me that I would not weep? People are returning with Ḥajj and ʿUmrah while I return with Ḥajj. So the Messenger ﷺ felt compassion for her, and he ordered her brother ʿAbd al-Raḥmān b. Abī Bakr al-Ṣiddīq to seat her behind him on the riding camel and to take her out to al-Tanʿīm; and he did so. She returned and performed ʿUmrah, and her soul was soothed. For that reason we say: whoever is afflicted among women with what afflicted her—she menstruated while performing ʿUmrah and is not able to complete the ʿUmrah—then her ʿUmrah turns into Ḥajj, and she makes up what she missed by the same method that Allah legislated on the tongue of His Messenger ﷺ for ʿĀʾishah: this other menstruating woman goes out to al-Tanʿīm and comes with ʿUmrah. As for men—praise be to Allah—they do not menstruate. What have they to do with the ruling of the menstruating woman?

P18a - The proof is that, as some scholars of sīrah and of the conditions of the Companions say: one hundred thousand of the Companions performed Ḥajj with the Messenger ﷺ, and none of them came with an ʿUmrah like the ʿUmrah of ʿĀʾishah, may Allah be pleased with her. If that had been good, they would have preceded us to it. For that reason, whoever wants to perform ʿUmrah returns to the mīqāt and enters iḥrām from there, whether on behalf of himself or on behalf of his mother and father. With this amount there is sufficiency, and praise be to Allah, Lord of the worlds.
Questioner: If you would allow me…
The Shaykh: The time is 11?
