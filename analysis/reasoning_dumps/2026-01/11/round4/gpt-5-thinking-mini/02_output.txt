P1 - The Shaykh:
All praise is due to Allah; we praise Him, seek His help, and ask His forgiveness. We seek refuge in Allah from the evils of our souls and from the badness of our deeds. Whomever Allah guides, none can mislead him; and whomever He leaves astray, none can guide him. I bear witness that there is no god but Allah alone with no partner, and I bear witness that Muḥammad ﷺ is His servant and Messenger. As for what follows:
The best of speech is the speech of Allah, and the best guidance is the guidance of Muḥammad ﷺ, and the worst of matters are those newly invented, and every newly invented matter is a bidʿah (innovation), and every bidʿah (innovation) is ḍalālah (misguidance), and every ḍalālah (misguidance) is in the Fire.

P1a - Perhaps the brothers present all understand from the implication of this ḥadīth and its like, that which is established in the books of the Sunnah and has an authentic isnād to the Prophet ﷺ, such as the ḥadīth of ʿĀʾishah: "Whoever introduces into this affair of ours something that is not from it, it is rejected," and the ḥadīth of al-ʿArabāḍ b. Sāriyah, may Allah be pleased with him, who said: "The Messenger of Allah ﷺ admonished us with an admonition that made the hearts tremble and the eyes shed tears, so we said: O Messenger of Allah, advise us." He said: "I advise you to fear Allah, to listen and obey; and if a black slave is made ruler over you, then whoever of you lives will see much difference; so adhere to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the rightly guided caliphs who will come after me, hold onto it with your molar teeth, and beware of newly invented matters; every newly invented matter is a bidʿah (innovation), and every bidʿah (innovation) is ḍalālah (misguidance)." These ḥadīths affirm what I think you understand and believe: that innovation in the dīn (religion) is wholly misguidance; and by "in the dīn" I mean the blameworthy innovation is specific to dīn. As for worldly matters, some innovations are praiseworthy and some blameworthy, depending in this latter case whether the introduced thing opposes a sharʿī text — if it opposes sharʿ it is blameworthy, and if it does not oppose sharʿ it is at least permissible. One of the best things transmitted on this occasion is the saying of Shaykh al-Islām Ibn Taymiyyah, may Allah have mercy on him, where he set forth a very important principle derived from those ḥadīths plus other texts indicating that the default in things is permissibility, and this is a principle in uṣūl: "The default in dīn is prohibition except by text, and the default in worldly matters is permissibility except by text." He means: every newly invented matter in dīn is prohibited, whereas a newly invented matter in worldly affairs is permissible unless it contradicts a text as we mentioned. Then what should be noted is that the Prophet's ﷺ phrase "and beware of newly invented matters" means specifically every act of worship invented after the Prophet ﷺ, so that it is ḍalālah (misguidance) even though many people suppose it to be good. And rightly said ʿAbd Allāh b. ʿUmar b. al-Khaṭṭāb, may Allah be pleased with him: "Every bidʿah (innovation) is ḍalālah (misguidance) even if people see it as good." That is because istihsān (preference by personal judgment) in dīn means that the one who prefers has legislated for himself, while only our Lord may legislate what He wills; therefore al-Imām al-Shāfiʿī, may Allah have mercy on him, said: "Whoever approves by his own reason has legislated," because how does that approver know that what he approves by his reason alone, not drawn from the Book of his Lord or the Sunnah of His Prophet, is truly good? Thus our stance toward every newly invented matter in dīn must be to refrain from it in light of the previously mentioned authentic ḥadīths.

P2 - Questioner:
Some brothers present hear about the Salafī daʿwah by hearsay and read what is written by its opponents rather than by its followers and callers. I request of your nobility, since you are among the scholars and callers of the Salafī movement, to explain the position of Salafīyah among the Islamic groups today.
The Shaykh:
I have answered such a question more than once, but since a question has been raised I must answer. I say: a truth cannot be contested by any Muslim once the reality becomes clear to him:

P2a - First of all: the Salafī daʿwah — relative to what? Salafīyah is relative to the Salaf, so we must know who the Salaf are when the term is used by the scholars of the Muslims: the Salaf. Thus this relation is understood and what weight it has in its meaning and implication. The Salaf are the people of the three generations about whom the Messenger ﷺ testified to goodness in the mutawātir ḥadīth transmitted in al-Ṣaḥīḥayn and elsewhere from a group of the Companions from the Prophet ﷺ that he said: "The best people are my generation, then those who follow them, then those who follow them." Those three generations are the Salaf who were testified by the Messenger ﷺ to goodness. So Salafīyah belongs to those Salaf, and Salafīs belong to those Salaf. When we know the meaning of the Salaf and Salafīyah then I say two things:
First: that relation is not a relation to a person or persons, as are the names of other groups existing today on Islamic lands; it is not a relation to a person nor to tens of persons, but is a relation to ʿiṣmah (infallibility/being free from error), for the pious Salaf could not be united upon ḍalālah (misguidance). By contrast the later generations (al-khalf) did not receive in sharʿ praise but rather blame in their majorities, as in the completion of the previous ḥadīth where he ﷺ said: "Then will come after them peoples who will bear witness and not be called to witness …" and so on to the end of the ḥadīth. The Prophet ﷺ also pointed to this in another ḥadīth that contains praise for a group of Muslims and blame for their majorities in the sense of the ḥadīth when he said: "A group of my ummah will remain on the truth; they will not be harmed by those who oppose them until the command of Allah comes" or "until the Hour is established." This ḥadīth confines the praise late in time to a group, and a group (ṭāʾifah) is the jamaʿah small in number — in language it is applied to the individual and above. Thus when we know this meaning in Salafīyah that it belongs to the group of the righteous Salaf and that they are the ʿiṣmah if a Muslim adheres to what those pious Salaf were upon, then the second matter I pointed to earlier follows, namely: that every Muslim who then knows this relation and what it aims at regarding ʿiṣmah finds it impossible — I do not say: that he disavows — this is self-evident, but I say: it becomes impossible for him unless he is a Salafī, because we understood that affiliation to Salafīyah means affiliation to ʿiṣmah. From where do we take this ʿiṣmah?

P2b - We take it from a ḥadīth by which some of the later generations (khalf) argue wrongly to support resorting to majority-rule — that which the generality of the khalf follow — when they bring the saying of the Prophet ﷺ: "My ummah will not agree upon ḍalālah (misguidance)." This ḥadīth cannot be applied to the khalf today given their radical disputes; "My ummah will not agree upon ḍalālah" cannot be applied to the reality of the Muslims today, and any student of this bad reality knows this. Added to that are the authentic ḥadīths that came explaining what occurred among those before us among the Jews and Christians and what will occur among the Muslims after the Messenger ﷺ in terms of division, for he ﷺ said: "The Jews split into seventy-one sects, and the Christians into seventy-two sects, and my ummah will split into seventy-three sects, all of them in the Fire except one." They said: Who is it, O Messenger of Allah? He said: "It is the jamaʿah." This jamaʿah is the jamaʿah of the Messenger ﷺ to which one can apply with certainty the previous ḥadīth: "My ummah will not agree upon ḍalālah." The intended by that ḥadīth are the ṣaḥābah whom the Messenger ﷺ judged to be the saved sect, and whoever follows their way and follows their path. These pious Salaf are the ones from whom our Lord, exalted is He, warned us in the Qurʾān against opposing them and following other than their way in His saying: "And whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him and follows other than the way of the believers, We will turn him over to what he has turned over to and burn him in Hell — what an evil destination." I have often pointed out to our brothers on many occasions the wisdom in Allah's conjunctive phrase in this verse: "and follows other than the way of the believers" upon "whoever opposes the Messenger." What is the wisdom of that? If the verse were without that clause — if it were simply: "And whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him We will turn him over…" — that alone would suffice to warn and rebuke one who opposes the Messenger ﷺ and to adjudge his grievous end. The verse was not thus; rather it added "and follows other than the way of the believers." Is this idle or accidental?

P2c - Far be it from the speech of Allah, exalted is He, that there be idle words — namely, that one follows other than the way of the ṣaḥābah who are the ʿiṣmah in our earlier expression and they are the jamaʿah whom the Messenger ﷺ testified as being the saved sect; and whoever follows their way are those who, if one wishes to avoid the torment of Allah on the Day of Resurrection, must not differ from their way. Therefore He said: "And whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him and follows other than the way of the believers, We will turn him over to what he has turned over to and burn him in Hell — what an evil destination."
Thus Muslims today in the latter times must know two matters:

P2d - First: who are the "believers" mentioned in this verse? And then what is the wisdom of hearing the Qurʾān and the ḥadīths of the Messenger ﷺ directly from them and that they had the advantage of witnessing the practical application of the Messenger ﷺ to the texts of the Book and the Sunnah? Part of the wisdom stated in the Sunnah is his ﷺ saying: "Direct reporting is not like seeing" (laysa al-khabar ka-al-muʿāyanah), and the poet began with that and said: "What one sees is not like what one hears." Thus those who did not witness the Messenger ﷺ are not like his Companions who watched and heard from him directly and understood it better than those who merely received reports. Today there is a contemporary expression some Islamic preachers have coined which is very fine, but better yet is to make it actual reality. They say in their lectures, admonitions, and guidance that Islam must be made a reality that walks the earth. It is good speech, but if we do not understand Islam in light of the understanding of the pious Salaf as we say, we cannot realize this beautiful phrase into actual reality. Those who achieved that were the Companions of the Messenger ﷺ for the two reasons mentioned: they heard the speech from him directly and so they comprehended it better, and secondly in matters requiring practical clarification they saw the Messenger ﷺ demonstrate that clarification. I give you a very clear example: there are verses in the Qurʾān that a Muslim cannot understand unless he knows the Sunnah that clarifies the Qurʾān, as Allah, exalted is He, said: "And We have revealed to you the Reminder that you may make clear to the people what was revealed to them." For example His saying: "As for the male thief and the female thief, cut off their hands." Now bring Sībawayh of this time in grammar and have him interpret this noble verse for us: "Who is the thief?" Linguistically one cannot specify who the thief is, and "hand" what is meant by it? The Sībawayh of the end of time cannot give answers to these two questions: who is the thief deserving of hand-cutting? And which hand is to be cut in relation to that thief?

P2e - In language: a thief who steals an egg is a thief, and a hand if cut here or here or anywhere is a hand; but the answer is that when the previous verse said: "And We have revealed to you the Reminder that you may make clear to the people what was revealed to them" the answer is in the clarification, and there is clarification from the Messenger ﷺ of the Qurʾān, and this clarification he ﷺ applied in reality specifically to this verse as an example and to many other verses, and there are many of them, because whoever studied uṣūl (principles) reads there is the general and particular, the absolute and the restricted, abrogating and abrogated, general words under which dozens of texts fall, if not hundreds of texts — general texts that the Sunnah supplies. I do not wish to lengthen this so that we may answer the remaining questions.

P3 - Questioner:
If the parents refuse that a daughter visit her sister in Allah and she longs for her and they always refuse this visit, is she allowed by Islām to go to visit her without informing them? Or should she tell them something untrue?
The Shaykh:
It is not permissible for her to visit without parental permission, and it is not permissible for her to lie to them. Rather she must convince her parents that this visit is one the Wise Legislator commands. If they are convinced, then fine; if they are not convinced, then the daughter — especially if she claims to be committed to the sharīʿah — must not disobey her parents in such a visitation.
Questioner:
My teacher, does the same apply to lessons? For example we are in a lesson and he admonishes about something?
The Shaykh:
The same thing: permission is required.

P4 - Questioner:
What is the ruling on wearing the khimār — covering the face and the hands — at the present time? And if the girl feels fitnah and chooses to wear it but the parents, especially the mother, refuse, what should she do?
The Shaykh:
If the refusal is limited to the face and the hands, then obedience to parents is required in that matter. But if the refusal encompasses more than that, then there is no obedience to a created being in disobedience to the Creator. That is: a woman must cover all her body except the face and the hands; covering them is not obligatory but is recommended. If the parents do not accept that their daughter cover her face and hands then there is no harm in obeying them and there is no sin in that, unlike if they desire her to uncover other than the face and hands; in that case there is no obedience to them because that would be disobedience.

P5 - The Shaykh:
An ishārib (scarf) is not sufficient; it must be a khimār that covers the entire head and the throat; the ishārib is not sāpigh (completely covering), and its covering is not sufficient.
Questioner:
Does the cover include the shoulders as well, our teacher?
The Shaykh:
Yes. That is the khimār. The description of the khimār is that it is loose and wide, covering the head and covering the shoulders. When we say: it covers the throat, if it covers the throat it covers the shoulders because it is wide. As for the ishārib, often we see women with something showing at the neck because of the ishārib, whereas the khimār covers the neck and the shoulders together. And Allah commanded that, for He said: "And let them cast their khumur (pl. of khimār) over their bosoms." As for the ishārib, this is among what today is called half-solutions; Islām has no half-solutions.

Questioner:
Teacher, many now among some of the committed men and women in religion and in their dress believe that the khimār is a veil for the face?
The Shaykh:
This is ignorance of the language. The khimār is a head covering, so a man "yakhtamir" — i.e., puts a khimār on his head — and likewise a woman. Therefore He said: "And let them cast their khumur over their bosoms." If the khimār covered the face, He would not say "cast" meaning draw it over; rather it would be a loose covering (sadl). This is ignorance in the language.

P6 - Questioner:
If a woman wears a high heel in her shoe, is that permissible? What is the ruling?
The Shaykh:
It is not permissible to imitate the disbelieving women or the immoral women. The origin of this is from Jewish women: before Islām, when one of them wished to attend a gathering where her lover would be, so that he might see her, she used to wear a kind of high wooden clog so she would be taller and be seen; over time this transformed into the shoe with a high heel. As for the shoe that causes a woman’s gait to change, tilting right and left, and for which the depraved disbelievers invented this type of footwear, a committed Muslim woman should not wear a high-heeled shoe, especially since oftentimes it causes her harm and falling and injuring her head for the smallest stumble in the road.

P7 - Questioner:
Is it permissible to speak ill of the disbeliever and the polytheist (istighābah)? And is it permissible to curse them?
The Shaykh:
All that is permissible, because a disbeliever has no sanctity, except if from that results a greater evil. For example: if one curses a disbeliever to his face or behind his back and it reaches him, then perhaps the Muslim will be cursed and his religion and his Prophet insulted, and so on; then it becomes impermissible for the Muslim to curse the polytheist.

P8 - Questioner:
In the verse "No one may touch it except the mutahhirūn," is "mutahhirūn" meant to be the believers or those who have performed wuduʾ? And what is the ruling regarding taking the Qurʾān to non-Muslim countries?
The Shaykh:
The intended meaning of the verse is neither of those two; rather it refers to the angels. It is a report from Allah, exalted is He, about the angels, and it does not refer to this Qurʾān; rather it refers to that which is in the Preserved Tablet. This muṣḥaf which is in the Preserved Tablet — "No one may touch it except the mutahhirūn" — they are the close angels. This is a declarative sentence and not an imperative sentence issuing a legal ruling. Allah speaks about the reality: that the Qurʾān in the protected Book — meaning the Preserved Tablet — none may touch it except the mutahhirūn, and they are the close angels. As for the muṣḥaf that is in our hands, it is touched by the righteous and the wicked, the believer and the disbeliever, so our Lord did not mean by this verse human beings categorically, whether righteous or wicked; rather, as we said, He meant the close angels.
