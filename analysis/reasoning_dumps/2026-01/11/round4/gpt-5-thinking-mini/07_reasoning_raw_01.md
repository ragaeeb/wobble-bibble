Considerations for transliteration and punctuation
The first segment needs careful attention for transliterations, including using "Muḥammad ﷺ" and following the ALA-LC standard. The prophetic salutation “صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم” should be replaced with the ﷺ symbol when it appears, and "Allah" should be retained as per the glossary, with translations for other Arabic phrases into English where necessary.

Transliteration and glossary consistency
I need to follow rules for transliteration, like using "Muḥammad" and replacing the full phrase with ﷺ when applicable. I’ll use terms like "bidʿah (innovation)" on first occurrence and just "innovation" later. I’ll apply the glossary for names (e.g., "Ibn Taymiyyah") and labels like "الشيخ" and "السائل" should be translated too.

Handling transliteration and religious phrases
I need to transliterate "ابن تيمية" as "Ibn Taymiyyah" using double y. The phrase "رحمه الله" should be translated as "may Allah have mercy on him," without parentheses since those are reserved for specific terms. Same applies for "رضي الله عنه," which translates to "may Allah be pleased with him." No footnotes permitted.

Translating and following structure rules
In the first paragraph (P1), I need to ensure I correctly translate terms like "Allah" and "Muḥammad ﷺ", and follow the specific instructions about structure and accuracy over fluency. For terms like "hady," I’ll go with "guidance" (as indicated by the glossary), and will include transliterations for words like "bidʿah (innovation)" and "ḍalālah (misguidance)" on their first occurrence.

Preparing for precise translation formatting
I need to follow exact rules for formatting translations. For terms like 'ḍalālah' and 'hady,' I'll use transliteration with the English meaning on first mention, like "ḍalālah (misguidance)." Arabic script should only be used for ﷺ. I'll also be mindful of structured labels such as "The Shaykh:" followed by new lines as per instructions.
