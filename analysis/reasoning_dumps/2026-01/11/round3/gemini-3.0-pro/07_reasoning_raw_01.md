Clarifying proper name transliteration and salutations
I need to figure out how to handle transliterations and salutations like "محمد صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم." It should become "Muḥammad ﷺ," but I also need to follow some specific rules for consistency, like keeping "Muḥammad" as the anchor. I'll be careful with phrases like "رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم," transforming it to "Messenger of Allah ﷺ" where applicable.

Handling salutations and translations
For salutations, I'll add ﷺ after names like "محمد صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم." For phrases like "رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم", I'll translate that as "Messenger of Allah ﷺ." I need to avoid extra parentheses, so I'll use "peace be upon him" for "عليه السلام." I'll map "رسول الله" directly to "Messenger of Allah" too.

Dealing with salutations and Q&A mapping
For salutations, I'll append ﷺ when the source contains phrases like "صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ." For "عليه السلام," I'll translate it as "peace be upon him," as that seems appropriate. Regarding names, I’ll use the ALA-LC system for transliteration, like "ابن تيمية" to "Ibn Taymiyya." Moving forward, I’ll avoid additional parentheses or extra fields to follow the guidelines.

Transliteration and technical terms considerations
I'll adhere to ALA-LC transliteration for proper names, like "ابن القيم" as "Ibn al-Qayyim" and "شيخ الإسلام ابن تيمية" as "Shaykh al-Islām Ibn Taymiyya." For phrases like "رحمه الله," I'll avoid adding Arabic phrases but opt for something like "may Allah have mercy on him." I'll also ensure technical terms like "بدعة" get mapped correctly as "bidʿah (innovation)."

Handling translation, terms, and rules
For "Shaykh al-Islām Ibn Taymiyya," I’ll follow ALA-LC rules, using the proper transliteration. For "رحمه الله," I can’t add the Arabic phrase, so I’ll just omit that part. As for terms like "بدعة," I'll use "bidʿah (innovation)" on the first occurrence of each term per segment and continue with the English term afterwards.

Applying transliteration and glossary rules
For common terms like "Sunnah," I must use transliteration with English in parentheses the first time it appears in each segment. Since "Sunnah" is treated as a corpus word when capitalized, I will use "Sunnah (the Corpus)" for the first mention. For "السنة وصحيح الإسناد," it’s "Sunnah" capitalized following the glossary rules.

Applying glossary and formatting rules
For "Sunnah" I'll use "Sunnah (Prophetic Tradition)" as per the glossary's instructions. The rule is to use transliteration with English parentheses for common terms on the first occurrence, which means translating consistently. I also need to ensure technical terms, IDs, and Q&A formatting are preserved, like handling "الشيخ:" and "السائل:".

Translating hadith and names carefully
For hadith quotes, I'll translate text inside the quotes without adding isnad markers. For phrases like "رضي الله تعالى عنه," the translation should be "may Allah be pleased with him." Regarding names, I'll follow ALA-LC transliteration for names like "ʿĀʾishah," using the correct characters like "ʿ" for ayn and "ʾ" for hamza.

Translating names and terms following ALA-LC
I’ll use ALA-LC transliteration for names like "ʿĀʾishah" and "al-ʿArbaḍ b. Sāriyah." I'll also use Arabic names like "Ibn Taymiyya" correctly. For terms like "khimār," I'll transliterate it with "(veil)." For words like "Sībawayh" and "al-ishārib," I'll follow the best approach based on the context and the glossary. No Arabic script will be included.

Translating a segment with attention to terms and transliterations
I’ll translate the Arabic phrases accurately, using transliterations as required by the glossary. For terms like bidʿah (innovation) and ḍalālah (misguidance), I’ll mark the first occurrence in the segment accordingly. I’ll also use "Muḥammad ﷺ" for consistency and avoid adding unnecessary commentary.

Clarifying approach for transliterations and translations
I need to ensure no Arabic script is included, per the user's instructions, and that I only provide transliterations. For hadith quotes, I'll translate the meaning directly, not paraphrase. I'll also include terms like "bidʿah (innovation)" and proper transliterations for names like ʿĀʾishah and al-ʿArbaḍ b. Sāriyah. For Q&A formatting, I'll label accordingly.
