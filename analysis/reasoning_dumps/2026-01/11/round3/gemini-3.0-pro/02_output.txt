P1 - The Shaykh: Verily, all praise is due to Allah; we praise Him, we seek His aid, and we seek His forgiveness. We seek refuge in Allah from the evils of our souls and from the evil consequences of our actions. Whomever Allah guides, there is none to misguide him, and whomever He misguides, there is none to guide him. I testify that there is no deity except Allah alone, having no partner, and I testify that Muḥammad is His slave and His Messenger. As for what follows:
Verily, the best speech is the Speech of Allah, and the best guidance is the guidance of Muḥammad ﷺ. The worst of matters are the newly invented ones, and every newly invented matter is a bidʿah (innovation), and every *bidʿah* is misguidance, and every misguidance is in the Fire.

P1a - Perhaps the brothers present, all of them, know from the indication of this ḥadīth (prophetic tradition) and its likes—from what is established in the books of the Sunnah and is of authentic isnād (chain of narration) to the Prophet ﷺ, such as the *ḥadīth* of ʿĀʾishah: (Whoever introduces into this affair of ours that which is not from it, it is rejected), and such as the *ḥadīth* of Al-ʿIrbāḍ b. Sāriyah, may Allah the Exalted be pleased with him, who said: "The Messenger of Allah ﷺ admonished us with an admonition by which hearts trembled and eyes shed tears, so we said: 'O Messenger of Allah, advise us.'" He said: (I advise you to have taqwā (fear/consciousness) of Allah, and to listen and obey, even if an Abyssinian slave is appointed over you. For indeed, whoever among you lives long will see much difference. So upon you is my Sunnah and the sunnah (practice) of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs, the Mahdīs, after me. Bite onto it with your molar teeth, and beware of newly invented matters. For every newly invented matter is a *bidʿah*, and every *bidʿah* is misguidance). These ḥadīths confirm what I think you understand and believe: that innovation in the dīn (religion) is entirely misguidance. I mean in the *dīn*, because the blameworthy innovation is specific to the *dīn*. As for matters of the dunyā (world), some of it is praiseworthy and some of it is blameworthy, depending on this new thing: if it opposes a legislation, it is blameworthy, and if it does not oppose a legislation, it is at the very least permissible. Among the best of what is transmitted in this context is the statement of Shaykh al-Islām Ibn Taymiyyah, may Allah have mercy on him, where he established a very important rule derived from those ḥadīths plus other texts indicating that the default state in things is permissibility. This is a rule of uṣūl (principles); he said, may Allah have mercy on him: "The base principle in the *dīn* is prohibition except with a text, and the base principle in the *dunyā* is permissibility except with a text." He means: every new thing in the *dīn* is prohibited, while the new thing in the *dunyā* is permissible unless it opposes a text, as we mentioned. Then, among what should be alerted to is that his statement ﷺ: (And beware of newly invented matters) only means every act of worship that originated after the Prophet ﷺ; it is thus misguidance, even if in the conjecture of many people, they consider it to be good. Truthfully did ʿAbd Allāh b. ʿUmar b. al-Khaṭṭāb, may Allah be pleased with him, say: "Every *bidʿah* is misguidance, even if the people see it as good." That is because deeming something good (*istiḥsān*) in the *dīn* means that this person who deems it good has paired himself with the Lord of the Worlds, regarding Whom no one other than Him has the right to legislate except what Allah, Mighty and Majestic, willed. For this reason, the Imam Al-Shāfiʿī, may Allah have mercy on him, said: "Whoever deems something good has legislated." For how would this person who deems it good know that this thing, which he deemed good solely with his mind and thought and did not derive from the Book of his Lord or the Sunnah of his Prophet—from where does he know that this is a good matter?!
Therefore, our stance, all of us, toward every newly invented matter in the *dīn* must be to abstain from it, based on what was previously mentioned of authentic ḥadīths.

P2 - Questioner: Some of the brothers sitting hear about the Salafī call (*Daʿwah Salafiyyah*) by hearsay, and they read about it what is written by its adversaries, not by its followers and its callers. So what is hoped from your virtue, and you are among the scholars of Salafiyyah and its callers, is to explain the position of Salafiyyah among the Islamic groups today.
The Shaykh: I have answered the likes of this question more than once, but an answer is necessary since a question has been posed. So I say: A word of truth regarding which no Muslim can argue after the reality becomes clear to him:

P2a - First of that: The Salafī Call, attribution to what? Salafiyyah is an attribution to the Salaf (Predecessors). So we must know who the *Salaf* are when the term "The Salaf" is used absolutely among the scholars of the Muslims, and consequently understand this attribution and what its weight is in its meaning and indication. The *Salaf*: They are the people of the three generations for whom the Messenger of Allah ﷺ testified to goodness in the authentic mutawātir (mass-transmitted) *ḥadīth* extracted in the two Ṣaḥīḥs and others, from a group of the Companions, from the Prophet ﷺ that he said: (The best of people are my generation, then those who follow them, then those who follow them). These three generations are those for whom the Messenger, upon him be peace, testified to goodness. So Salafiyyah belongs to this *Salaf*, and the Salafis belong to these *Salaf*. If we know the meaning of the *Salaf* and Salafiyyah, I will then state two matters:
The First Matter: That this attribution is not an attribution to a person or persons, as are the attributions of other groups present today on Islamic earth. This is not an attribution to a person nor to tens of persons; rather, this attribution is an attribution to infallibility (*ʿiṣmah*). That is because it is impossible for the Pious Predecessors (*al-Salaf al-Ṣāliḥ*) to agree upon a misguidance. Contrary to this is the Khalaf (Successors/Later Generations); for the *Khalaf*, no praise has come in the Sharīʿah regarding them; rather, censure has come regarding the masses of them. That is in the completion of the previous *ḥadīth* where he ﷺ said: (Then there will come after them peoples who testify but are not asked to testify...) to the end of the *ḥadīth*. Just as he ﷺ indicated that in another *ḥadīth* which contains praise for a faction (*ṭāʾifah*) of the Muslims and censure for their masses by the implication of the *ḥadīth*, where he ﷺ said: (A faction of my Ummah will not cease to be manifest upon the truth; those who oppose them will not harm them until the command of Allah comes) or (until the Hour is established). This *ḥadīth* restricted the praise in the end of time to a faction. The faction (*ṭāʾifah*): is the small group; for in the language, it applies to a single individual and upwards.
So then, if we know this meaning in Salafiyyah—that it belongs to the group of the Pious Predecessors, and that they are the infallibility in the case where the Muslim holds fast to what these Pious Predecessors were upon—then comes the second matter which I pointed to just now, which is: That every Muslim, when he knows this attribution and what it aims at regarding infallibility, it becomes impossible for him after this knowledge and clarification to—I will not say: to disavow, for this is a self-evident matter—but I say: it becomes impossible for him but to be a Salafī. Because we have understood that affiliation to Salafiyyah means: affiliation to infallibility. From where did we take this infallibility?

P2b - We take it from a *ḥadīth* which some of the *Khalaf* use to argue for the contrary of the truth; they use it to argue for the authority of taking the majority opinion—that which the masses of the *Khalaf* are upon—when they bring his statement ﷺ: (My Ummah does not gather on misguidance). It is not correct to apply this *ḥadīth* to the *Khalaf* today given the radical differences between them. (My Ummah does not gather on misguidance) cannot be applied to the reality of the Muslims today, and this is a matter known to every student of this bad reality. Added to that are the authentic ḥadīths which came clarifying what occurred among those before us of the Jews and Christians, and what will occur among the Muslims after the Messenger, upon him be peace, regarding division. He ﷺ said: (The Jews split into seventy-one sects, and the Christians into seventy-two sects, and my Ummah will split into seventy-three sects, all of them in the Fire except one). They said: "Who is it, O Messenger of Allah?" He said: (It is the Jamāʿah [The Group]). This *Jamāʿah*: it is the *Jamāʿah* of the Messenger, upon him be peace; it is the one regarding which one can be certain in applying the previous *ḥadīth*: (My Ummah does not gather on misguidance) that the intent of this *ḥadīth* is the Companions, whom the Messenger, upon him be peace, judged to be the Saved Sect (*al-Firqah al-Nājiyah*). Whoever treads their path and heads in their direction... These Pious Predecessors are the ones regarding whom our Lord, Mighty and Majestic, warned us in the Noble Qurʾān against opposing them and against following a path other than their path, in His statement, Mighty and Majestic: «And whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him and follows other than the way of the believers - We will give him what he has taken and drive him into Hell, and evil it is as a destination» [4:115]. I have drawn the attention of our brothers in many occasions to the wisdom of our Lord, Mighty and Majestic, conjoining His statement in this verse: «and follows other than the way of the believers» to the opposition of the Messenger. What is the wisdom in that? Even though the verse, were it with the deletion of this sentence—were it as follows: «And whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him - We will give him what he has taken and drive him into Hell, and evil it is as a destination»—it would have been sufficient in warning and rebuking the one who opposes the Messenger ﷺ, and judging him with his evil destiny. The verse was not like this; rather, it added to that His statement, Mighty and Majestic: «and follows other than the way of the believers». is this futile?!

P2c - Far be it from the Speech of Allah, Mighty and Majestic, to be futile. Meaning: Whoever follows other than the path of the Companions—who are the infallibility in our previous expression, and they are the *Jamāʿah* for whom the Messenger, upon him be peace, testified that it is the Saved Sect, and whoever treads their path—these are the ones whom it is not permissible to oppose their path for anyone who wants to escape the punishment of Allah on the Day of Resurrection. For that reason, He, the Exalted, said: «And whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him and follows other than the way of the believers - We will give him what he has taken and drive him into Hell, and evil it is as a destination» [4:115].
So then, upon the Muslims today in the end of time is to know two matters:

P2d - First: Who are the believers mentioned in this verse? Then what is the wisdom... [implied: those who] heard the Qurʾān and the ḥadīths of the Messenger, upon him be peace, directly from him? Then, [later people] did not have the virtue of viewing the application of the Messenger, upon him be peace, of the texts of the Book and the Sunnah as a practical application. Among the wisdom explicitly stated in the Sunnah is his statement ﷺ: (Reporting is not like witnessing). From it began, and from it the poet took his statement: "And a seer is not like one who heard." So then, those who did not witness the Messenger, upon him be peace, are not like his Companions who witnessed and heard the speech from him directly and saw it from him as a practical application. Today there exists a modern phrase popularized by some Islamic callers (*duʿāt*), and it is a very beautiful phrase, but more beautiful than it is that we make it a realized fact. They say in their lectures, sermons, and guidance that we must "Make Islam a reality walking on earth." Beautiful speech. But if we do not understand Islam—and in the light of the understanding of the Pious Predecessors as we say—we cannot realize this beautiful poetic speech: "to make Islam a factual reality walking on earth." Those who were able to do that were the Companions of the Messenger, upon him be peace, for the two reasons mentioned previously: They heard the speech from him directly, so they comprehended it better than anyone else comprehended, then for matters there that require actual clarification, they saw the Messenger, upon him be peace, clarifying that for them in action. I will strike a very clear example for you. There are verses in the Noble Qurʾān that a Muslim cannot understand unless he is knowledgeable of the Sunnah that explains the Noble Qurʾān, as He, Mighty and Majestic, said: «And We revealed to you the message that you may make clear to the people what was sent down to them». For example, His statement, the Exalted: «[As for] the thief, the male and the female, amputate their hands». Now, bring the Sībawayh of this time in the Arabic language, and let him interpret this noble verse for us. «The thief»—who is he? Linguistically, he cannot define the thief. And the hand, what is it? The Sībawayh of the end of time cannot give the answer to these two questions: Who is the thief who deserves amputation of the hand? And what is the hand that ought to be amputated regarding this thief?

P2e - Linguistically: The thief, if he stole an egg, is a thief. And the hand in this [verse], if it were cut here, or here, or in any place, is a hand. But the answer is [found] when he mentioned the previous verse: «And We revealed to you the message that you may make clear to the people what was sent down to them». The answer is in the clarification. So there is a clarification from the Messenger, upon him be peace, for the Qurʾān. This clarification, he ﷺ applied it in action regarding this verse specifically as an example, and regarding other verses—and how many they are. For whoever reads in the science of Uṣūl (Principles of Jurisprudence) reads in the science of *Uṣūl* that there is general and specific (*ʿāmm wa khāṣṣ*), absolute and restricted (*muṭlaq wa muqayyad*), and abrogating and abrogated (*nāsikh wa mansūkh*). Summarized words under which enter tens of texts, if we do not say hundreds of texts. General texts which the Sunnah specified. I do not wish to prolong this so that we can answer the rest of the questions.

P3 - Questioner: If the parents refuse for their daughter to visit a sister of hers in Allah, and she misses her, and they always refuse this visit, does Islam permit her to go out to visit her without informing them of that? Or should she tell them something untrue?
The Shaykh: It is not permissible for her to visit her without the permission of her parents, just as it is not permissible for her to lie to them. Rather, she must convince the parents that this visit is something the Wise Lawgiver commands. If they are convinced, then so be it. If they are not convinced, then it is not permissible for the girl—especially if she claims she is committed (*multazimah*) to the Sharīʿah—to exit from the obedience of her parents in the likes of this visit.
Questioner: My teacher, regarding... does this apply to lessons as well? We are in a lesson, for example, admonition regarding something?
The Shaykh: The same thing; permission is mandatory.

P4 - Questioner: What is the ruling on wearing the *khimār*—covering the face and the two hands—in the current time? If the young woman feels [fear of] fitnah (temptation/tribulation) and chooses to wear [it], but the family refuses, especially the mother, what should she do?
The Shaykh: If the refusal is limited to the face and the two hands, then obedience to the parents is obligatory in that. However, if the refusal encompasses more than that, then there is no obedience to a created being in the disobedience of the Creator. Meaning: It is obligatory upon the woman to cover her entire body except the face and the two hands; covering them is not obligatory, but it is *mustaḥabb* (recommended). So if the father [or parents] is not pleased with that for their daughter—that she covers her face and her hands—there is no objection to her obeying them, and there is no sin in that. Contrary to if they desired from her to uncover other than the face and the hands; then there is no obedience to them upon her, because that is a sin.

P5 - The *Echarpe* (scarf) is not sufficient; it must be a *khimār* such that it covers the entire head and the chest (*naḥr*). The *Echarpe* is not ample (*sābigh*), and its covering is not sufficient.
Questioner: Does the covering include the shoulders as well, our teacher?
The Shaykh: Yes, this is the *khimār*. The description of the *khimār* is that it is loose and wide, covering the head and covering the shoulders. When we say: "covers the chest," when it covers the chest, it covers the shoulders because it is wide. As for the *Echarpe*, we often see women where something of the neck appears due to the *Echarpe*, whereas the *khimār* covers the neck and the shoulders together. Allah commanded that, for He said: «And let them wrap their headcovers (*khumur*) over their chests (*juyūb*)». As for this *Echarpe*, this is from the category of—as is said today—half-solutions, and there are no half-solutions in Islam.
Questioner: My teacher, many now of some of, meaning, the committed men and committed women (*multazimīn*) in the *dīn* and in their dress believe that the *khimār* is the face cover?
The Shaykh: This is ignorance of the language. The *khimār*: it is the headcover. Therefore, the man adopts a *khimār* (*yakhtamir*), meaning: he places the *khimār* on his head, and the woman likewise. For that reason, He said: «And let them wrap their headcovers (*khumur*) over their chests». If the *khimār* covered the face, He would not say: (wrap over), meaning: tighten it/draw it over. Rather, it implies lowering (*sadl*). This is ignorance of the language.

P6 - Questioner: If a woman wears a high heel in her shoe, is that permissible for her? And what is the ruling?
The Shaykh: Resemblance (*tashabbuh*) to the unbelieving women or the immoral women is not permissible. The origin of this is from the Jewish women; they used to in the old times, before Islam, if one of them wanted to attend a gathering where her lover was, so that he could see her, she would wear a type of high wooden clog (*qabqāb*), so she would become tall and be seen. Then with time, this transformed into the sandal with the high heel. As for this sandal which makes the woman—meaning—change her gait, tilting right and left; and for that sake, the immoral unbelievers invented this type of sandal. So it does not befit the committed Muslim woman to wear a sandal with a high heel, especially since in many instances it is a cause for her harm and her falling upon the crown of her head if she stumbles on the road for the slightest reason.

P7 - Questioner: Is it permissible to backbite (*ghībah*) the disbeliever (*kāfir*) and the polytheist woman? And is it permissible to insult them?
The Shaykh: All of that is permissible, because the *kāfir* has no sanctity (*ḥurmah*), unless a corruption (*mafsadah*) results from behind that. For example: if he insults the *kāfir* to his face or behind his back, and it reaches him, so perhaps he insults the Muslim and insults his *dīn* and his Prophet, to the end of it. At that point, the Muslim insulting the polytheist becomes prohibited.

P8 - Questioner: In the verse: «None touch it except the purified», is the intent by "The Purified": the believers or those in a state of wudu? And what is the ruling on not taking the Qurʾān to the disbelieving lands?
The Shaykh: The intent of the verse is neither this nor that. Rather, the intent: it is the Angels. It is a report from Allah, Mighty and Majestic, about the Angels, and not this [physical] Qurʾān, but rather the one which is in the Preserved Tablet (*al-Lawḥ al-Maḥfūẓ*). So this *muṣḥaf* (codex) which is in the Preserved Tablet, «None touch it except the purified», and they are the drawn-near Angels. This is a declarative sentence (*jumlah khabariyyah*), not an inceptive sentence (*jumlah inshāʾiyyah*)—meaning: issuing a Sharīʿah ruling. Allah is speaking about the reality: that the Qurʾān, meaning the one in the Hidden Book (*al-Kitāb al-Maknūn*)—meaning the Preserved Tablet—this, «None touch it except the purified», and they are the drawn-near Angels. As for the *muṣḥaf* which is between our hands, this is touched by the righteous and the wicked, and the believer and the disbeliever. So our Lord, Mighty and Majestic, does not mean by this verse humans absolutely, whether they are righteous or wicked; rather He means, as we said: the drawn-near Angels.

P8a - As for traveling with the Qurʾān and the *muṣḥaf* to the land of the enemy, it is not permissible unless it is secured that it will not be touched by evil or be humiliated. So it is permissible then; if we are secure that the *muṣḥaf* will not be humiliated, it is permissible to introduce it to the land of the disbelievers so that perhaps they, meaning, are enabled to read it and study it.

P9 - [Beginning of answer is cut off] ...and for that reason he ﷺ said: (All of Allah's creation is beautiful). Yes, a man or a woman whose eyebrow or her eyebrow is joined with the other; this the human does not possess. This is the creation of Allah, so we must be content with the creation of Allah, as He, Blessed and Exalted, said... Yes, he mentioned the verse... The important point is that our Lord, Mighty and Majestic—now the verse came: «And your Lord creates what He wills and chooses; not for them was the choice. Exalted is Allah and high above what they associate with Him». This is the answer to the last question.

P10 - Questioner (The Shaykh ʿAlī Ḥasan al-Ḥalabī): Regarding reading the Qurʾān and touching the *muṣḥaf* for the junub (person in state of major impurity), what is the ruling on that? And Tawaf around the House likewise.
The Shaykh: And Tawaf around the House, yes.
Questioner (The Shaykh ʿAlī b. Ḥasan al-Ḥalabī): Touching the *muṣḥaf* and reading the Qurʾān—meaning—it is not part of a verse, nor for example seeking blessings or fear [of something], something intentional, and he touches the *muṣḥaf* and reads. So what is the ruling on that as well? Advise us, may Allah advise you.
The Shaykh: May Allah bless everyone. We say: There is no doubt that the remembrance of Allah, Blessed and Exalted, has its sanctity and its inviolability. Therefore, it is agreed upon among the scholars of the Muslims that reading the Qurʾān upon complete purity is what is best and what is befitting the greatness of the Speech of Allah, Mighty and Majestic. If it has been authenticated from the Prophet ﷺ that he refused to utter a name from the Names of Allah, Mighty and Majestic—which is (Al-Salām)—except upon purity, in the *ḥadīth* known in the Sunan such as the Musnad of Aḥmad and others: That a man greeted the Prophet ﷺ with peace, so he did nothing ﷺ but rush to the wall and performed wudu and returned the greeting of peace, and said: (I disliked to mention Allah except upon purity). To mention Allah, because (Al-Salām) is a name from the Names of Allah. Just as also in the authentic *ḥadīth* in the book *Al-Adab al-Mufrad* by Imam Al-Bukhārī from the *ḥadīth* of ʿAbd Allāh b. Masʿūd, who said: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: (Al-Salām is a name from the Names of Allah which He placed in the earth, so spread it among you). This "Salām", the Messenger, upon him be blessings and peace, disliked returning it to the one who greeted him except upon purity.

P10a - The Qurʾān, while one is not pure—whether the minor purity or the major—[is permissible] due to the lack of existence of a proof prohibiting the Muslim from reading the Qurʾān while he is upon other than purity. However, this *ḥadīth* contains a very clear encouragement to read the Qurʾān while upon complete purity. But here is a thing: This ruling, which is "the best," in the most complete, perfect form—not every legally responsible Muslim (*mukallaf*) is capable of it, except the men only. As for the women, then sometimes and sometimes [i.e., fluctuating states]. Just now you heard the statement of the Messenger ﷺ to the Lady ʿĀʾishah who menstruated; he said to her: (Do what the Pilgrim does, other than that you do not perform Tawaf nor pray). So at that point, it is not said to her: "Perform wudu," as we say to the man, because she is not capable legislatively (*sharʿan*) of performing wudu; she is not capable legislatively of purifying herself. Therefore, she may read what she wills of the Qurʾān without us saying: "outweighed and weighty" (*marjūḥ wa rājiḥ*) as we say regarding the *junub* man, for example. We say: He should perform ghusl, because he is capable of performing ghusl, and thereby he purifies himself. So we say: It is better for you to perform wudu. As for the menstruating woman, as for the woman with post-partum bleeding (*nifās*) upon whom passes in some instances, or in a genus of the genera of women, forty days or more while she is in a state of *nifās*—so is it said to her: "Do not read!"? We do not have a proof preventing the Muslim generally, men let alone women—preventing them from reading the Qurʾān except upon purity. The *ḥadīth* which Al-Tirmidhī related in his Sunan from the *ḥadīth* of Ibn ʿUmar, may Allah be pleased with him, who said: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: (The menstruating woman and the junub do not read [anything] of the Qurʾān). This is a munkar (denounced/rejected) *ḥadīth* as the Imam of the Sunnah Aḥmad b. Ḥanbal says. This *ḥadīth* is not authentic. If it were authentic, stopping at it would be obligatory. In addition to the weakness of this *ḥadīth* and what might be in the chapter of its likes from the weak narrations, before us is the *ḥadīth* of the Lady ʿĀʾishah where he commanded her and permitted her to do everything the Pilgrim does, except that she does not pray nor perform Tawaf. Do you see the Pilgrim not reading the Qurʾān? Or is there a season for reading the Qurʾān? Because there is free time and there is the turning of the Pilgrim with his entirety to Allah, Blessed and Exalted. Without a doubt, he reads the Qurʾān. So then, this *ḥadīth* contains a direct permission for the menstruating woman to read the Qurʾān. So it is not permissible for us to prevent the women from reading the Qurʾān under the pretext that she is not pure. If Allah had prevented her as He prevented her from the prayer, we would have stopped at this prevention and ceased. But we find the Wise Lawgiver has revealed to the Noble Messenger the differentiation between the prayer and between the parts of the prayer. Because some people say: "O my brother, the reading is a pillar from the pillars of the prayer! So why do we not mandate purity for this reading when it is a part of the parts of the prayer?"

P10b - We say: The reading is not the only thing that is a part of the parts of the prayer. For the first thing the prayer is opened with is our saying: "Allāhu Akbar". So let us say: Then, it is not permissible for a Muslim to say: (Allāhu Akbar) except upon purity, because it is a pillar from the pillars of the prayer. Likewise, it is said regarding the *tasbīḥ* (saying Subḥān Allāh), *taḥmīd* (saying Al-ḥamdu lillāh), and *takbīr*, to the end of it. There is no escape from that at all, while maintaining what we mentioned: that it is best to mention Allah upon purity. Likewise, exactly the same is said regarding touching the Qurʾān. Also, touching the Qurʾān is legislated [permitted], and reports (*āthār*) have come from some Companions that they used to abstain—actually, not intellectually—abstain intellectually from touching the Qurʾān except upon wudu. This contains a clarification of what is best for the one who wants to touch the Qurʾān or to read the Qurʾān. As for obligation and the statement that it is prohibited for the woman who is not pure, let alone the man, to touch the Qurʾān—this has no proof for it at all. People, without doubt, imagine that there are proofs, but they are not proofs at all. Of that, for example, is what confuses the affair for many people, especially those who have a fondness and have a care for the recitation of the Qurʾān, when he reads the statement of Allah, Mighty and Majestic, in the Qurʾān: «None touch it except the purified». The error has reached [the point] of carrying this verse onto this subject we are in—meaning: that they interpret His statement, Mighty and Majestic: «None touch it» meaning: this *muṣḥaf* which is between our hands; «except the purified» meaning: except those in wudu. This delusion has reached [the point] that it is published on every copy printed in the Islamic world of the Noble Qurʾān: a title «None touch it except the purified». This is an error resembling another error from the angle of intellectual scientific error first, then from the angle of its publication and generalization to the people second. The verse which is written on the prayer niches (*maḥārīb*): «Whenever Zakariyyā entered the sanctuary (*miḥrāb*) to [see] her, he found with her provision». The *miḥrāb* means a window/niche; this is a lie, this is ignorance. The intent by the *miḥrāb*: is the place of prayer. «Whenever Zakariyyā entered the sanctuary (*miḥrāb*) to [see] her» meaning: the room in which she was secluded from the people worshiping Allah, Mighty and Majestic. This is the *miḥrāb*, and the *miḥrāb* is not this which has been introduced into the mosques since old times, with intense regret, due to being influenced by the altars of the churches, the altars (*maḥārīb*) of the Christians in their churches. Otherwise, in Islam, there is no *miḥrāb*; the Mosque of the Messenger, upon him be peace, did not have a *miḥrāb*. And the famous Egyptian Ḥāfiẓ Al-Suyūṭī—Al-Ḥāfiẓ Al-Suyūṭī, the author of *Al-Jāmiʿ al-Kabīr* and *Al-Jāmiʿ al-Ṣaghīr*—has a treatise, perhaps I have forgotten its title—yes—*Iʿlām al-Arīb*, and this—meaning—is a very valuable research. He transmits texts there from the people of knowledge that the existence of *maḥārīb* in the mosques is from the newly invented matters.

P10c - The Witness: The previous verse «None touch it except the purified» has no relation to the subject of touching the Qurʾān which is between our hands. This has a large explanation which I will summarize as much as possible, so I say: «None touch it» the pronoun here returns to the Hidden Book (*Al-Kitāb Al-Maknūn*) mentioned before, because Allah, Mighty and Majestic, says: «None touch it except the purified» referring to the Hidden Book. This Book of ours—and all praise is due to Allah—is not hidden (*maknūn*), because what is the meaning of *maknūn*? It means hidden, preserved/guarded meaning, and you do not see it, and the hands of devils do not reach it. Therefore, Imam Mālik, may Allah have mercy on him, has—meaning—a good and very subtle understanding in his book *Al-Muwaṭṭaʾ* in the tafsīr (exegesis) of this verse, where he says: The best of what I heard in its tafsīr is that it is like the verse which is in Sūrat ʿAbasa: «No! Indeed, they are a reminder * So whoever wills may remember it * In honored sheets * Exalted and purified * By the hands of scribes * Noble and dutiful» [80:11-16]. Who are these scribes? The Angels. These Angels are themselves the ones intended [by the statement] that they touch, and that other than them do not touch that Hidden Book. This is a contextual indicator (*qarīnah*). And there are other indicators, and among the strongest of them: is that He, the Exalted, said: «except the purified» (*al-muṭahharūn*). We, the assembly of humans, it is not permissible for us to describe ourselves—no matter how high we soar and ascend in righteousness and taqwā—that we are *muṭahharūn* (purified [by Allah/inherently]). We are not *muṭahharūn*; and it is not permissible for the human to be *muṭahhar* ever. Rather, we are contaminated (*mulawwathūn*), and the righteous among us is the one who burdens himself so he purifies himself (*yataṭahhar*). The righteous among us is the one who burdens himself, meaning: he fabricates/creates the purity, otherwise it is not of his nature that he is pure. The *Muṭahharūn* are the Angels described in the Noble Qurʾān by His statement, Mighty and Majestic: «They do not disobey Allah in what He commands them but do what they are commanded» [66:6]. As for the humans, they are the ones whom Allah, Mighty and Majestic, meant: «Indeed, Allah loves those who are constantly repentant and loves those who purify themselves (*al-mutaṭahhirīn*)» [2:222]. Likewise when He mentioned the Mosque of Qubāʾ, He said: «Within it are men who love to purify themselves (*yataṭahharū*)» [9:108]. So if we were like them, then congratulations to us, meaning we purify ourselves (*nataṭahhar*). As for being *muṭahharīn*, then how far, how far!
So the witness from using this verse as evidence, and linking it to this subject, is a widespread error. Among the best of those who spoke on this verse, better than what we mentioned, and from whom we derived [this], is the Great Scholar Ibn al-Qayyim al-Jawziyyah, in his book *Aqsām al-Qurʾān*. There he elaborated and did well. Perhaps in this there is sufficiency, if Allah wills.

P11 - Questioner: What is the ruling on stipulating conditions (*ishtirāṭ*) in Hajj and Umrah: (O Allah, my place of release is where You detain me), and what is binding upon the one who stipulates a condition to complete his rituals?
The Shaykh: The ruling on stipulating conditions: Permissibility. Its fruit: is that if the one who wants Hajj or Umrah stipulates [it], then something befalls him preventing him from completing Hajj or Umrah—and this is known in the language of the Sharīʿah as *Iḥṣār* (being blocked/prevented)—if he is blocked, then "whatever is easy of the sacrificial animal (*hady*)" [is required]; this is an obligatory matter. Everyone who is unable to complete the Hajj, upon him is the *hady*, and upon him is the Hajj in the coming year. Contrary to the one who stipulates a condition at the beginning of his iḥrām, saying: "O Allah, my place of release is where You detain me." He is absolved from the obligation of repeating the Hajj which was obstructed, and furthermore, the *hady* is not obligatory upon him. Contrary to if he did not stipulate; this is what the Messenger ﷺ intended in the authentic *ḥadīth* known from him, which is his statement ﷺ: (Whoever is broken, or sick, or limps, has released [himself from iḥrām], and upon him is another Hajj in the coming [year]). This is if he did not stipulate. But if he stipulated, then there is nothing upon him at all. With the alert that the repetition is upon him [only] if he had [not yet] performed the obligatory Hajj, or the Hajj of Islam. So if he did not stipulate and was blocked and could not continue the Hajj, upon him in the coming [year] is repetition of the Hajj even if he had performed the obligation of Hajj [before]. This is the answer to what you asked.

P12 - The Shaykh: ...Meaning you are asking about the *ḥadīth*: (They do not perform ruqyah nor seek ruqyah). Here is a question I will cast to you with its answer, if Allah wills, after I deliver a brief word regarding an etiquette from the etiquettes of gatherings which people today, specially them let alone their masses, have neglected. From these etiquettes: is gathering, massing together, and closeness in the gathering, and not being distant in it. This is from the wisdoms of the Sharīʿah in many of its apparent rulings, regarding which explicit mention came in some of the authentic ḥadīths. For instance, in *Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim*, the *ḥadīth* of Jābir b. Samurah—as I recall: That the Prophet ﷺ entered the mosque one day and saw them separated in circles upon circles, so he said to them: (Why do I see you separate (*ʿizīn*)?

P12a - ) Meaning: Divided. And more important than this is what Imam Aḥmad narrates in his book *Al-Musnad* with the strong chain from Abū Thaʿlabah al-Khushanī, may Allah be pleased with him, who said: "When we traveled with the Prophet ﷺ and encamped, we dispersed in the mountain passes and the valleys. So we traveled one day and encamped as we used to encamp, so he, upon him be blessings and peace, said to them: (Indeed, your dispersing in these mountain passes and valleys is only from the work of Satan)." He said: "So after that, when we encamped in a place, we gathered together such that if we sat on a carpet/sheet, it would hold us." So (what) is your opinion while you are sitting here on a leveled, easy surface? This separation is not from the sunnah of Islam. Therefore, the more the circle is compact, the more it is encompassed by the mercy of Allah, Mighty and Majestic, and His bounty. Many people are ignorant that there is a very strong connection between the outer of the human and his inner. This strong connection is among what many of the ḥadīths of the Messenger ﷺ concurred in indicating. Perhaps you know the phrase mentioned in many of the books: "The outer is the title of the inner." This is what the poet pointed to of old when he said:
"Whatever nature is in a man * Even if he thinks it hidden from people, it will be known."

P12b - So there must be a connection between the outer and between the inner. Therefore, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ took care with extreme care in rectifying the outers of the Muslims let alone their inner. For he ﷺ, just as he came with rectifying hearts and inners, likewise he came with rectifying bodies and outers together. So the matter is not only, as many people say: "The consideration is what is in the inner." Yes, the consideration is what is in the inner, but that does not necessitate lack of care for the outer. For this reason, he, upon him be blessings and peace, said—when he saw that man or heard that man say, while the Messenger ﷺ was admonishing people upon obedience to Allah and following His Book—that man stood to say to him: "What Allah willed and you willed, O Messenger of Allah." So he ﷺ became angry with a severe anger, and said: (Say: What Allah willed alone). This is an apparent wording; it appeared from the tongue of that Companion as an error from him. However, this outer [expression] is contrary to his inner with certainty, because his inner was full of faith in Allah and His Messenger ﷺ. But when he erred in the wording, the Messenger ﷺ did not stay silent about him; rather, he rectified his phrase for him and said to him: (Say: What Allah willed alone). The Messenger of Allah ﷺ knows with certainty that this man did not intend what his wording indicated; his wording indicated that he made the Messenger a partner with Allah in His Will, Blessed and Exalted. But this Companion knows that the Will of Allah, Blessed and Exalted, is before everything and above everything, because he reads in the Noble Qurʾān: «And you do not will except that Allah wills - Lord of the worlds». No one thinks that this Companion is ignorant of this reality, but his tongue caused him to err. However, the Messenger ﷺ corrected him and directed him to what he should say. He said to him: (Say: What Allah willed alone). And in another narration: (What Allah willed, then you willed). The ḥadīths in this regard are many, and I am not now in the context of clarifying them, because it is a word about gathering in the assembly and not separating in it. However, before I finish it, I see myself compelled to remind of another *ḥadīth* only, due to what is in it of magnificence regarding the concern of the Messenger, Allah's blessings and peace be upon him, in rectifying the expressions of people and their outers. That is his statement ﷺ: (Let not one of you say: My soul has become evil (*khabuthat*)). (Let not one of you say: My soul has become evil (*khabuthat*), but rather: It has become agitated (*laqisat*)). What is the meaning of: (*laqisat*)?

P12c - In the language it equals: (*khabuthat*). (*Laqisat*) linguistically is in the meaning of: (*khabuthat*). But the word: "The Evil One" (*al-khabīthah*), is evil/vile. So the Messenger ﷺ did not want the Muslim to utter it when he finds in himself something of this vileness with the wording: (*al-khubth*). Rather, he diverted him away from it to the wording: (*laqisat*). This wording, naturally, and you are Arabs, you do not know it; but the Master of the Arabs and non-Arabs is the one who taught it to you and said: (Let not one of you say: My soul has become evil (*khabuthat*), but rather: It has become agitated (*laqisat*)). This is regarding the etiquette of the Muslim with himself, because he is a Muslim. So what is your thought regarding etiquette with Allah and with His Prophet, upon him be blessings and peace?! So it is more appropriate that the Muslim has etiquette with Allah, then with His Messenger ﷺ, so he does not come with a phrase that might touch the station of Prophethood or the station of the Message. Just now—and the questioner should notice this—a questioner asked me between me and him; perhaps he said: "Is it legislated or is it permissible for the hearer of the Adhān to say..."

P14 - Questioner: ...while they are [still] alive. So what is the ruling of the Sharīʿah on that?
The Shaykh: If the intent by the distribution is gift (*hibah*) and giving, then this has its ruling. And if the intent by it is dividing the inheritance before the arrival of its time, then this has another ruling. Then, for each of the two rulings is a division which differs from the division of the other ruling. If the father wants, if he divides his wealth, to gift what he has of wealth to his children, then here comes his statement ﷺ: (Be just between your children). So he must make [the portions] equal here between the male and the female. As for if the intent is the division of inheritance, then this is premature first of all. Then, it might create dispute and difference between the children due to rushing the execution of the ruling; and this ruling whose time has not come yet, because inheritance is only realized by the death of the inheritee.

P15 - Questioner: Is the visit of the Prophet ﷺ to the graveyard at night specific to him, upon him be blessings and peace?
The Shaykh: No, it is not specific to him.

P16 - Questioner: If Al-Ḥākim says in his *Mustadrak*: "This *ḥadīth* is upon the condition of Al-Bukhārī" and he did not extract it [in his Ṣaḥīḥ], and Al-Dhahabī affirmed him on that, or Al-Dhahabī said about the *ḥadīth* that it is *ṣaḥīḥ* (authentic), then is such a *ḥadīth* relied upon then? And is it used as proof just as any *ḥadīth* in the two Ṣaḥīḥs is used as proof?
The Shaykh: Here the answer differs regarding the general people, and regarding some of the elite people. And by this "some," I mean: the scholars of Ḥadīth. As for the general people, their duty, as we began in the word of this session, is to ask the people of knowledge. There is no doubt that Al-Ḥākim is from the people of knowledge of Ḥadīth, regarding authentication (*taṣḥīḥ*) and weakening (*taḍʿīf*), especially if we measure him against one who has no knowledge—I do not mean the commoners (*al-ʿāmmah*), but the elite of the end of time who do not study the science of Ḥadīth. So it is obligatory that they return to him, and that they look: What is his stance on the *ḥadīth*? If he authenticated it, they follow him, unless the error of Al-Ḥākim becomes clear by the judgment of another who is more knowledgeable in the science of Ḥadīth than him. So with greater reason and appropriateness, if Al-Ḥākim authenticated a *ḥadīth* and Al-Dhahabī agreed with him on it, then upon the general Muslims is to follow that, unless it becomes clear to them by a transmission from a scholar that Al-Ḥākim had a delusion (*wahm*) and Al-Dhahabī also followed him in his delusion. At that point, one returns from following him or following them both, to following the correctness which became clear to him from other than them. As for the elite scholars of Ḥadīth, then due to what they have been given of knowledge regarding the biographies of the narrators of ḥadīths first, and what they have been given of knowledge regarding the Terminology of Ḥadīth (*Muṣṭalaḥ al-Ḥadīth*) second, it is not obligatory upon these to follow Al-Ḥākim, nor even Al-Dhahabī. Because it becomes clear to them in many instances that much delusion and error occurred in their authentication. In summary, just as it is obligatory upon the general Muslims...
[Cut in the tape],
...in one case: when the error of that Faqīh or the error of that Muḥaddith becomes clear to them, then the error is not permissible to be followed.

P17 - Questioner: In the same chapter, teacher, how is the filtering (*taṣfiyah*) done? And what is considered a *ḥadīth* according to some Muḥaddithīn is considered a *ḥasan* (fair) *ḥadīth* according to others, and what is considered bad according to some of them is considered *ḥasan* or *ḍaʿīf* (weak) according to others?
The Shaykh: This, and no offense, is "a clatter we know from Akhzam" [Arabic proverb: an old, familiar argument]. The filtering, we mean what is possible of it. The weak and fabricated ḥadīths spread in the books—which we mentioned—from the books of Tafsīr, Ḥadīth, behavior (*sulūk*), ethics, and the like are too many to be counted in the hundreds; rather, in the thousands. I am a single person; the number of weak and fabricated ḥadīths with me has reached until now approximately above six thousand weak ḥadīths. I alone. So what do you imagine if there was in the Islamic world an abundance and multitude of people of knowledge specialized [in this]? They would unearth the likes of these ḥadīths from the bellies of the books, forms many and very many. So why do we come to some ḥadīths regarding which some scholars of Ḥadīth differ—as some say: "There are Fiqh rulings also in which some scholars differed." So we say: There are issues established among the researchers in Fiqh to be error opposing the Book and the Sunnah; so it is obligatory to filter it and remove it from the path of the Fuqahāʾ. Likewise, there are ḥadīths agreed upon their weakness, nay, upon their fabrication; so it is obligatory to remove them from the bellies of the books and from the minds of the students of knowledge and likewise the scholars. There remains, without doubt, some Fiqh issues and some ḥadīths that are a place of difference. The fact that something of that remains does not bring about the likes of this question, because we do not believe—contrary to what is rumored by some biased people or ignorant people—that we want to unify all the madhhabs (schools of thought) and make the four madhhabs one madhhab. We—I do not say: we are the most knowledgeable of people—we are the most knowledgeable of people that this is impossible. It is impossible to gather people on one madhhab. It is impossible to gather people on one thought. But it is not impossible to bring closeness (*taqrīb*) between people, especially Ahl al-Sunnah wa al-Jamāʿah. Bringing closeness is possible—and this is reality and witnessed. For those who study the Fiqh which is called today "Comparative Fiqh" (*Al-Fiqh al-Muqāran*)—even if this study in the universities is still superficial, because the doctor specialized in Sharīʿah and Fiqh presents the issue and the sayings said regarding it and the proofs of all of them, then he leaves the students bewildered. He does not know what is the correct one of these sayings because he presented their proofs. There might be a general verse and a detailed *ḥadīth*, so he does not say "this *ḥadīth* specifies the verse." There might be a madhhab inferring via an authentic *ḥadīth* and another via a weak *ḥadīth*, so he does not turn towards distinguishing the authentic from the weak, and so on. So he leaves what?

P17a - The students bewildered. Therefore I say: This Comparative Fiqh today is studied superficially. Those who study a complete study such that—as they say today also: "they place the dots on the letters"—they say: "This one's proof is such, and this one's proof is such, and this one's proof [is such], and the preponderant view (*rājiḥ*) is such and such, for the reason of such and such." These know that those who tread this Fiqh methodology—and it is what is called Comparative Fiqh—that it brings closeness between the Muslims. These are examples between our hands present today. Who from the students of knowledge does not hear of Imam Al-Shawkānī? Who from the students of knowledge does not hear of Al-Ṣanʿānī? Who from the people of knowledge does not hear of Ṣāliḥ al-Muqbilī? The author of *Al-ʿIlm al-Shāmikh fī Īthār al-Ḥaqq ʿalā al-Ābāʾ wa al-Mashāyikh*. Who does not hear of these? No one. These, their origin is Zaydiyyah, Zaydis. They were neither Hanafī, nor Shāfiʿī, nor Mālikī, nor Ḥanbalī. Meaning in the expression of these four madhhabs, those Zaydis are not from Ahl al-Sunnah wa al-Jamāʿah. But when they trod this path which we call the Muslims, all of them, to tread so that they come close and show affection and not distance nor hatred—then at that point, there was realized in them what was realized in these Imams whom we mentioned. Whereby they became with us; they became Sunnis; they began refuting the Zaydis, because they [the Zaydis] oppose the Sunnah. So then, this methodology harmonizes and does not divide. As for every human remaining on his madhhab, it is that which divides and does not unify.

P18 - Questioner: Is it permissible for me to perform Umrah twice in one trip, and I am from Jordan; so the first time from Abyār ʿAlī and the second time from Al-Tanʿīm, like: ʿĀʾishah, may Allah be pleased with her? If it is not permissible, then is it permissible on behalf of his deceased father or on behalf of his mother? And may Allah reward you with good.
The Shaykh: The one who wants to repeat the Umrah should return to the Mīqāt from which he entered iḥrām, and whether that is for himself or for his parents. As for entering iḥrām from Al-Tanʿīm, where the Lady ʿĀʾishah entered iḥrām, this is a ruling specific to ʿĀʾishah and whoever is like her. I express this Umrah from Al-Tanʿīm as: "The Menstruating Woman's Umrah." That is because ʿĀʾishah, may Allah be pleased with her, when she went out with the Prophet ﷺ performing Hajj in the Farewell Hajj, and she had entered iḥrām for Umrah; when she arrived at a place close to Makkah known as "Sarif," the Messenger, upon him be peace, entered upon her and found her weeping. He said to her: (What is wrong with you weeping? Have you got your menses/nifās?) She said: "Yes, O Messenger of Allah." He said, upon him be peace: (This is a matter Allah has written upon the daughters of Adam. So do what the Pilgrim does other than that you do not perform Tawaf nor pray). So she did not perform Tawaf nor pray until she became pure in Arafat. Then she continued the rites of Hajj and performed the Hajj completely. When the Messenger, upon him be peace, resolved to travel and return to Madīnah, he entered upon her in her tent and found her also weeping. He said: (What is wrong with you?) She said: "What is wrong with me? People return with a Hajj and an Umrah, and I return with a Hajj without an Umrah." That is because due to her menses, her Umrah flipped into Hajj—a Qirān Hajj (combining both). So she is now weeping in regret over what she missed of the Umrah before the Hajj, while her co-wives, like Umm Salamah and others, returned with an Umrah and a Hajj. Therefore she is weeping, saying: "What is wrong with me that I should not weep? People return with a Hajj and an Umrah and I return with a Hajj." So the Messenger, upon him be peace, felt pity for her, and commanded her brother ʿAbd al-Raḥmān b. Abī Bakr al-Ṣiddīq to let her ride behind him on the she-camel and to go out with her to Al-Tanʿīm. So he did, and she returned and performed Umrah and her soul became pleasant. Therefore we say: Whoever is afflicted by the likes of what afflicted her among the women, where she menstruated while she was a *Muʿtamirah* (performer of Umrah) and could not complete the Umrah, so her Umrah flips to Hajj; so she compensates what she missed with the same method which Allah legislated upon the tongue of His Messenger for ʿĀʾishah. So this other menstruating woman goes out to Al-Tanʿīm and performs the Umrah. As for the men, they—and all praise is due to Allah—do not menstruate, so what do they have to do with the ruling of the menstruating woman?

P18a - And the proof is that, as some scholars of Sīrah (biography) and conditions of the Companions say: One hundred thousand of the Companions performed Hajj with the Messenger; not one of them came with an Umrah like the Umrah of ʿĀʾishah, may Allah be pleased with her. If that were good, they would have preceded us to it. Therefore, whoever wants to perform Umrah returns to the Mīqāt and enters iḥrām from there, whether for himself or for his mother and his father. And in this amount is sufficiency, and all praise is due to Allah, Lord of the Worlds.
Questioner: If you allow me...
The Shaykh: The time is 11?
