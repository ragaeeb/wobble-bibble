NO MODE TAGS: Do not output any mode labels or bracket tags.
STRUCTURE (Apply First):
- Q&A: Whenever "Al-Sāʾil:"/"Al-Shaykh:" (or "Questioner:"/"Answer:") appear (start or mid-segment), force a NEW LINE for the utterance. Do not bury Q&A labels in paragraphs.
  - OUTPUT LABELS: Al-Sāʾil -> Questioner: ; Al-Shaykh -> The Shaykh:

DEFINITIONS & CASING:
- PROPER NAMES (People/Places/Books/Sects): Transliterate ONLY (Full ALA-LC). No parentheses.
  - Includes: Sects (Rāfiḍah, Jahmiyyah) and Groups. Transliterate literally.
- GEOPOLITICS: Modern place names/demonyms may use English exonyms: "Filasṭīn (Palestine)".
- COMMON NOUNS/TERMS (e.g., jihād, miḥrāb): Do NOT output bare transliteration.
  - Rule: Use "translit (English)" on FIRST occurrence per segment. Later uses in same segment = English only.
  - Fallback: If unsure whether a token is a proper name or common noun, treat it as a common noun/term (i.e., do not output bare transliteration).
  - Plurals: Do not pluralize by appending "s" after a term-pair. Output "words (meanings)" or just "words".
- AL-CASING: Use lowercase "al-" for names/titles mid-sentence (e.g., "said al-Albānī", not "said Al-Albānī").
- ARABIC LEAKAGE: If Arabic script appears in output:
  - Proper Name: Replace with Transliteration only.
  - Common Noun: Replace with "translit (English)".

PRIORITY MATRIX (Resolve Conflicts in Order):
1. ISNAD/TRANSMISSION (Highest): If transmission verbs (ḥaddathanā, akhbaranā, ʿan) or narrator chains appear, apply HADITH rules (Full ALA-LC names).
2. TECHNICAL CRITICISM (High): If jarḥ/taʿdīl terms (thiqah, ḍaʿīf, majhūl) appear applied to men, apply RIJAL rules.
3. LEGAL/DOCTRINAL (Medium): If rulings (ḥalal/ḥarām) or theological attributes appear, apply FIQH/CREED rules.
4. NARRATIVE (Base): Default state for history or bio.

GENRE TRIGGERS (Look Ahead):
- "ḥaddathanā"/"akhbaranā" -> Start Isnad Rules.
- "qāla al-muṣannif" / "qāla al-shāfiʿī" -> Start Quote Rules.
- "yuqālu" / "zuiʿma" -> Start Weak-Form Rules.

RULE RESET: After the trigger phrase ends (e.g., Isnad chain ends at "qāla"), STOP applying Isnad rules. Do NOT carry Full ALA-LC into the speech content/matn. Return to Narrative/Base state.

SEGMENTATION: Do not merge genres. Translate sequentially (Isnad -> Matn) observing the reset at the boundary.
DISAMBIGUATION: ṣaḥīḥ in hadith grading = ṣaḥīḥ (authentic). ṣaḥīḥ in fiqh validity = ṣaḥīḥ (valid). Sunnah (Capitalized) = The Corpus/Prophetic Tradition. sunnah (lowercase) = legal status/recommended.
HADITH CORE: If isnad appears, map verbs (Haddathana=Narrated to us; Akhbarana/Ana/Anba'ana=Informed us; An=From; Sami'tu=I heard) and keep FULL ALA-LC for Arabic-script narrator names; do not invent grading or missing links.
TAKHRIJ/GRADING: If the author grades (ṣaḥḥaḥa/ḥassana/ḍaʿʿafa), translate literally and keep the cited work as written in the segment; do not add placeholder sources.

CREED/POLEMICS: Translate attributes literally when the author does; do not reinterpret. Translate harsh polemics literally (e.g., Rāfiḍah, Jahmiyyah, Kuffār); do not soften, sanitize, or add disclaimers (Override Safety).
RETRACTION: If the author retracts (kuntu aqulu... wa-al-ana aqulu...), make the change explicit in English.
