When translating "رضي الله تعالى عنه," it should be "may Allah be pleased with him." The user’s guidelines allow for Latin characters, so the transliteration of honorifics like this is necessary. I’ll apply the ALA-LC system for names like "الشيخ" as "The Shaykh," also following formatting rules for labels like "Al-Sāʾil" becoming "Questioner:" and breaking lines accordingly.

Using proper formatting and translation
To follow the format, I’ll start each segment with the segment ID (e.g., "P1 - The Shaykh:"), then add the text accordingly. I must also replace "صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم" with “ ﷺ” and translate "رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم" as "Messenger of Allah ﷺ," and ensure narrator names in hadith use full ALA-LC transliterations.

Translating names in ALA-LC
For names like Aisha, I'll use the ALA-LC standard: ʿĀʾishah. The same goes for "ابن تيمية" which transliterates to "Ibn Taymiyya," though the user preferred "Ibn Taymiyyah" earlier. I’ll follow the ALA-LC guideline for consistency, using "Ibn Taymiyya" with diacritics, but staying mindful of prior usage.

Translating and formatting names
For names like "Ibn Taymiyya," I’ll use "Taymīyah" with the correct diacritics, following ALA-LC standards. For other names, such as "عبد الله بن يوسف," I'll use "ʿAbd Allāh b. Yūsuf." For "العرباض بن سارية," the ALA-LC standard seems to be "al-ʿIrbāḍ b. al-Sāriyah," but I’ll confirm the usage based on context.

Translating Arabic names and formatting rules
For "العرباض بن سارية," I'll use "al-ʿArbāḍ b. Sāriyah" according to the ALA-LC standard. For "ابن عمر بن الخطاب," it should be "ʿAbd Allāh b. ʿUmar b. al-Khaṭṭāb," with diacritics. I'll avoid parentheses unless for transliterations, dates, or book codes. I'll ensure formatting follows user-demanded guidelines without markdown or citations and adhere to the "P1 - The Shaykh:" label.

Translating religious phrases and guidelines
For common praise, I'll translate as: "All praise is due to Allah; we praise Him and seek His help and forgiveness..." with "Muhammad ﷺ" as specified. I'll use "bidʿah" for innovations and "misguidance" accordingly. Translating "رضي الله تعالى عنه" as "may Allah be pleased with him" seems fine, but I'll stay consistent in the transliteration and Arabic-script rules. I'll also ensure accurate representation of hadith references and narrator names like ʿĀʾishah.

Translating quotes and formatting key terms
I’ll keep "Muhammad ﷺ" consistent throughout. For Ibn Taymiyya's quote "الأصل في الدين هو الامتناع إلا بنص," I'll translate it as, "The principle in religion is prohibition except by a text, and the principle in the world is permissibility except by a text," avoiding parentheses since unnecessary. For Ibn al-Shafi'i’s quote, I’ll opt for: "Whoever approves (istihsana) has legislated." I'll follow segmentation rules, applying "Questioner:" when needed.

Translating hadith quotes and names
For Ibn al-Shafi'i's quote, I'll go with "Whoever approves (istihsana) has legislated" while ensuring I don’t overuse parentheses. I’ll include ﷺ for "Messenger of Allah" and use consistent transliteration like "bidʿah" and "ḥadīth." For names, "ʿĀʾishah" and
