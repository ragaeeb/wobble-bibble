Translating with specific guidelines
I need to follow strict rules for transliterations and translations. For Arabic, I must use ALA-LC transliteration and provide definitions at first occurrence. For example, "المبيت" could become "al-mubayt." I’ll map titles like "السائل" and "الشيخ" to appropriate labels ("Questioner:" and "The Shaykh:"). I’ll ensure no sanitization or markdown, just plain text.

Translating and transliterating names and titles correctly
I need to follow strict rules for transliterating names and titles. For titles like "الشيخ", it should be "The Shaykh:". Names such as "بن باز" become "Ibn Bāz" in ALA-LC. When it comes to book titles, like "كتاب الوابل الصيب", I should only transliterate it as "Kitāb al-Wābil al-Ṣa'ib", not translate the meaning.

Translating place names and defining terms clearly
When translating names like "مزدلفة", it should be "Muzdalifah" with macrons according to ALA-LC rules. For terms like "عرفة" it becomes "ʿArafah" with the ʿ. I also need to include both the transliteration and the English term immediately, like "Muzdalifah (Muzdalifah)." All technical terms must be defined on first occurrence in this format.

Balancing transliteration and definition rules
I’m wondering if, on first occurrence, I should always include the English term in parentheses after a transliterated token. The "DEFINITION RULE" suggests defining technical terms this way, but "PROPER NAMES" says to skip the parentheses. For places like "Muzdalifah," I need to follow the transliteration matrix, but I also need to obey the coupling rule for translations. Looks like some rules conflict, and I'm not sure on priority here.

Handling technical terms and place names in transliteration
For technical terms in the locked glossary, such as "ḥadīth," I must use both the transliterated term and its English definition on first occurrence. For place names, I follow the ALA-LC rules, adding English (in parentheses) for multi-word transliterations, like al-Muzdalifah. However, single-word names and terms in the glossary stay transliterated only, unless otherwise clearly defined.

Translating terms and handling technical definitions
The user wants technical terms to be defined, but not inferred or changed. For example, terms like "al-mubayt" and "wājib" should be translated literally, with transliterations the first time, along with English definitions only for technical terms. For place names, I should follow the COUPLING rule, adding English in parentheses only for multi-word transliterations.

Translating Arabic terms and defining technical terms
For this, I'll carefully translate the Arabic text with a strong, literal approach while adhering to the rules about technical terms. "Muzdalifah" and "ʿArafah" need to be transliterated without parentheses, while terms like "al-mubayt," "rukn," "wājib," and "ṣalāh" require definitions on their first appearance. I'll make sure all of this is consistent with the DEFINITION RULE.
