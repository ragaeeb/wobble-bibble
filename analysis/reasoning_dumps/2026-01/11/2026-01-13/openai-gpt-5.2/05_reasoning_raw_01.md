Applying ALA-LC rules for Arabic names and salutations
I need to replace phrases like "صلى الله عليه وسلم" with ﷺ. For example, "صدق رسول الله صلى عليه وسلم" becomes "The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said...". I must also transliterate names according to ALA-LC rules, using macrons, including "Anas b. Mālik." I'll apply these guidelines as best as I can.

Translating Arabic segments and labels
I need to ensure correct transliteration according to the matrix, using macrons for names and handling connectors like "b." and "Ibn". For segments that include Q&A labels like "السائل:" as "Questioner:" and "الشيخ:" as "The Shaykh:", I'll structure the text. I'll handle each speaker's lines accordingly while avoiding parenthetical transliterations, except for technical terms when they're first introduced.

Defining technical terms on first occurrence
I need to ensure that the first occurrence of transliterated technical terms is accompanied by a definition. For example, "Sunnah" should be defined as "Sunnah (The Corpus/Prophetic Tradition)" on its first appearance. Ritual terms like "takbīr" should be treated as common nouns with transliteration in the proper format.

Defining transliterated terms on first occurrence
For the term "takbīr," I'll define it as "takbīr (saying 'Allāhu akbar')" on its first occurrence, using simple English. I also need to do this for other terms like "tahlīl" and "talbiyyah," avoiding extra inferences but ensuring accurate translations and adhering to the format of transliteration followed by English definitions.

Handling technical and ritual terms
For terms like "Qurʾān," I'll transliterate it as "Qurʾān (Book Name)" on first occurrence, following the glossary's rule. Similarly, "ṣalāh" will be "ṣalāh (prayer)" and "ʿĪd (festival)" where applicable. For ritual terms like "takbīr," I'll translate as "takbīr (saying 'Allāhu akbar')." I'll also define "Sunnah (The Corpus/Prophetic Tradition)" as intended.

Translating technical terms in a ḥadīth
For the phrase from P5455, the first occurrence of technical terms like "ḥadīth" will be translated as "ḥadīth (report)." I’ll also ensure that "mushrikīn" is transliterated as "mushrikīn (polytheists)." For "زبد", I'll translate it as "zabdh (froth)" to adhere to transliteration rules, though "froth" may suffice as well.

Translating terms with consistency and first occurrences
I'll translate and define key technical words as they appear for the first time. For example, "ḥadīth" will be defined as "ḥadīth (report)" and "Sunnah" as "Sunnah (The Corpus/Prophetic Tradition)." Common terms like "zabad" will also be transliterated, like "zabad (froth)." I'll be careful with terms like "rafʻ" and ensure proper transliterations with macrons and ʿayn.

Being precise with literal translations and term definitions
For this translation, I’ll stick closely to the original text, being literal without paraphrasing. I'm tracking which technical terms have appeared and ensuring to define them on first use, like "Sunnah" and "takbīr," while keeping definitions brief. For terms like "ʿĪd," I'll transliterate book titles but add definitions where applicable.

Transliteration and consistency for technical terms
I’m reviewing the terms to ensure I translate and transliterate them accurately on first occurrence. For example, "ʿĪd" will be transliterated directly as "ʿĪd al-Fiṭr" and "ʿĪd al-Aḍḥā," with a clear definition. I’ll track recurring terms like "nafl" and "ṣalawāt" and maintain consistency in the text.
