P5455 - Questioner: The ḥadīth (report) that, our Shaykh, we always mention in this chapter if it is authentic — it is the ḥadīth: "Indeed I forbade the zabad (froth) of the mushrikīn (polytheists)," meaning concerning their giving...
The Shaykh: Yes, by Allah. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ spoke the truth...

P5456 - The Shaykh: … Let the witness convey it to the absent; it is not our task to make exact calculations whether the few are the followers and the many the dissenters or vice versa. First, that is beyond our capacity because that requires induction and exhaustive investigation, and that is not within our remit nor in our possession. Second: whatever would follow from that, even if we could do it, would be of little benefit. The important thing is that you clarify the Sunnah (The Corpus/Prophetic Tradition), then after that it is no concern of yours whether people followed it or not. That is what occurred to me on this occasion. And truly many people do not pay attention to distinguishing between taḥrīk (movement), khafḍ (lowering) and rafʿ (raising); therefore we strive, according to our capacity and attention — and what we fail at most is to admonish and remind our brothers who are with us on the straight path, God willing. As for when we see a person far from the Sunnah, then pursuing with him the difference between taḥrīk and khafḍ or rafʿ becomes futile. Rather, for one who is with us as we said upon the Sunnah and who thinks that khafḍ and rafʿ are the Sunnah, it is easy and very simple to remind him that you intended the Sunnah — may Allah reward you — but the Sunnah is taḥrīk (movement), not khafḍ and rafʿ; bring forth what you have. Go ahead.

P5457 - Questioner: Concerning the takbīr (saying "Allāhu akbar") for the ʿĪd (festival) prayer: for me, even after the prayer there is no takbīr in the mosque! I forbade the takbīr to prevent them from saying takbīr together with one another. I know that there are reports indicating it is permissible to perform takbīr on the two ʿĪdayn, but I forbid this takbīr — I tell them to apply the Sunnah (The Corpus/Prophetic Tradition) by saying it when coming … outside the mosque?
The Shaykh: As far as I know, the takbīr in the two ʿĪdayn differs between one and the other. The takbīr for ʿĪd al-Fiṭr (festival of breaking the fast) ends with the prayer, whereas the takbīr for ʿĪd al-Aḍḥā (festival of sacrifice) — the four days of the ʿĪd — are all occasions for takbīr. Then this takbīr is a Sunnah that in this regard is contrary to the prevailing Sunnah in the adhkār (remembrances), where the prevailing Sunnah in the adhkār is secrecy (isrār) not aloud (ijāhār). But there are exceptional instances in which this general Sunnah is set aside and aloudness (ijāhār) is legislated; from this category are the takbīrāt of the two ʿĪdayn, with the clarification of the distinction I mentioned above. What is meant is that the takbīr in ʿĪd al-Aḍḥā during all four days is aloud (ijāhār) and not secret (isrār), but it is not from the Sunnah to specially confine the post-prayer times (dubr al-ṣalawāt) to takbīr of the ʿĪd; rather every hour of the hours of the four days of ʿĪd it is prescribed to make the takbīr aloud. As for the particularization to after the prayers, that has no basis. Therefore we should not treat disease with disease: if people have committed themselves to making takbīr aloud after the prayers and that has no basis in the Sunnah, we do not prohibit them because they have committed to it, but we admonish them because they abstained from takbīr at all other times and particularized this time — namely after the prayer — for takbīr. This particularization is what has no basis. So we say to them: say takbīr and make it aloud during all the days of the ʿĪd — before the prayer, after the prayer, between prayers, night and day — and so forth. That is the answer to what you asked me about.
Questioner: Is it permissible here to say takbīr even before the establishment (iqāmah) of the prayer?

P5457a - The Shaykh: At all times without adherence to any particular restriction — at all times. This is a rare Islamic phenomenon on all days of the year: every dhikr (remembrance) follows what was reported, privately in secret and publicly aloud. For example: the talbīyah (talbiyah) in Ḥajj and in ʿUmrah — the Sunnah in it is to raise the voice, indeed not only to raise the voice but to exaggerate in raising the voice — and therefore it is reported in some authentic ḥadīth that the Companions, may Allah be pleased with them, when they performed Ḥajj with the Prophet ﷺ, as Anas b. Mālik reports: "They used to cry out the talbīyah with a cry until..." in another narration "(their voices became hoarse) when they reached al-Rawḥā" — this is contrary to the general principle. The principle in all adhkār (remembrances) is secrecy and lowering, but the talbīyah in Ḥajj and likewise the takbīr in the ʿĪd are exceptions to this principle. Therefore concerning the talbīyah in Ḥajj, when the Prophet ﷺ was asked about the best of Ḥajj he said: "The best Ḥajj is al-thajj and al-ʿajj" — al-thajj is slaughter and al-ʿajj is raising the voice in talbīyah.
And things are mentioned by way of comparing like is said; I draw attention that the talbīyah is not confined to Ḥajj or ʿUmrah only; they also used to pronounce tahallul (declare God's praise) — so if they pronounced tahallul in Ḥajj they likewise raised their voices. This is particular to Ḥajj and similarly ʿUmrah, although it is reported in Ṣaḥīḥayn from Abū Mūsā al-Ashʿarī, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Prophet ﷺ was traveling from a journey and his companions whenever they ascended a high place they raised their voices, and when they descended into a valley they raised their voices, and the Prophet ﷺ said to them: "O people, be lenient with yourselves; the One you are calling is not deaf nor absent; the One you are calling is nearer to each of you than the strap of his pack is to him; you call One who is All-Hearing, All-Seeing." The point is that the Prophet ﷺ disapproved of their raising their voices with tasbīḥ when they descended into a valley and takbīr when they ascended a height; he admonished them that the principle is non-raising and said "be lenient with yourselves." So does that principle apply to this branch, which is the talbīyah aloud and tahallul aloud in Ḥajj and ʿUmrah? The answer: No. This is the requirement of pure, sound following without the impurities of shirk in the message — just as we perform some of the prayers aloud and some secretly, or some parts aloud and some secretly, as we were taught and as reached us. So we have nothing to do except following. Hence it was said:
"All good is in following those who preceded * All evil is in innovation from those who came after"
and the like.

P5458 - Questioner: Is it permissible to hold the Qurʾān (Book Name) in the obligatory (muKtaba) prayer, meaning to read it while holding it present?
The Shaykh: As for the obligatory prayers, I do not think anyone claims its legality. Rather the known disagreement is in the nafila (supererogatory prayer) — and not in every nafila, but in qiyām al-layl (night prayer), and not in every standing of the night, but specifically in the night prayer in Ramadan. The disagreement in that locus only: some see that as permissible and allow it, especially if the imām has not memorized much of the Qurʾān; others do not regard it as legitimate. I am with the latter for two reasons. The first reason: it was not known in the time of the Salaf (predecessors) — and I mean what I say when I say it was not known in the time of the Salaf, that is, as a social religious phenomenon. Let no one object by saying there is a report that a slave of ʿAʾisha, may Allah be pleased with her, used to lead her from the muṣḥaf (codex) — for that report, even if authentic, does not contradict what I said earlier, because the occurrence of something inside four walls and not announced publicly while no one objected does not contradict our general statement: all good is in following the Salaf. If there was an action known among the Salaf without dispute, we follow and accept it. But in what we are upon now, that ʿAʾisha was led by her slave from an open muṣḥaf, this is a special case that may have its reasons and circumstances. That is the first reason: in short, it was not known among the Salaf as it is known among the successors; in many mosques in many lands today you find the imām places the muṣḥaf on a little table and reads from it — this phenomenon did not exist in the past among the righteous Salaf. Therefore we say: all good is in following the Salaf. This is the first point.

P5458a - The other matter: the saying that permits this action — in addition to claiming its legitimacy — entails contravening, or at least being contrary to, noble prophetic guidance which revolves around exhorting the Muslim who cares for leading the people in prayer; the imamate requires that one be distinguished by his memorization of the Qurʾān, since that is the primary reason that gives the memorizer the priority in leading the people, as occurs in Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim: "The one who should lead the people is the one most learned in the Book of Allah; if they are equal in reading then the most learned among them in the Sunnah; if equal in the Sunnah then the earliest emigrant; if equal in migration then the eldest among them." Thus the foremost qualification that makes one deserve the imamate is memorization of the Qurʾān. This memorization — lest it slip from the memorizer's breast given the toil he exerted to memorize it — the Prophet ﷺ said: "Rival one another for the Qurʾān and recite it, for by the One in whose hand is Muhammad's soul, it is more liable to slip from the breasts of men than a herd of camels to leave its cognition." "Rival one another for the Qurʾān" — opening the door to permitting the imām to read from an open muṣḥaf automatically diverts from implementing the prophetic command "rival one another for the Qurʾān." Why rival? And here are the scholars permitting the imām to read from an open muṣḥaf; this has the bad effect of diminishing interest in memorizing the Qurʾān. But it may have other harmful consequences that differ from one imām to another. I recall with these two eyes what I saw in some mosques when I was instructed to pray behind an imām — a prominent scholar among the imams of the Muslims — and he was reading in the standing of qiyām (the Tarāwīḥ prayer) from the muṣḥaf; when he bowed he put the muṣḥaf under his arm. Now imagine with me: it was almost wet because he could not raise his arms properly for the opening takbīr since the muṣḥaf would fall; so he would conceal it under his arm and thus not raise his hands properly. Does the prohibited effect stop at this state only? No — the matter becomes difficult when he prostrates while leading: he cannot free both his arms from under his armpits; he frees one like a sick person and not the other, why? Because he is clutching the muṣḥaf from which he was reading. Who says this is permissible? Thus someone innovated this practice; they set a table before them and place the muṣḥaf on it to avoid these awkward movements and bother to themselves — all this is affectation in religion.

P5458b - Therefore originally we must command the imāms with the command of our Prophet ﷺ: "Rival one another for the Qurʾān," and if that is not feasible then we say: let the one who leads the people be the one most learned in the Book of Allah. If there is an appointed imām — i.e., a salaried, responsible official — no one should precede him except by his permission, and not precedence by ostentation and reputation but precedence on the ground of rightful claim to the imamate if one knows he is more memorizing than him, then let him be given precedence (for one should not lead a man in his authority) as is known in some authentic ḥadīth: "He should not lead the man in his authority except by his permission." If he permits, then the other may lead; but it is recommended for one who leads in such a circumstance to show consideration for people's ranks: if he finds a man who is more learned in recitation or more learned in the Sunnah he should present him. If all doors are closed, then we say to the imām who has memorized only a little: "Recite what is easy of the Qurʾān" and that is the end of the matter. There is no need for such affectation and artificiality. My discourse here all pertains to the nafila and the nafila specifically in qiyām al-layl and more particularly qiyām al-layl in Ramadan. As for the obligatory (farḍ) prayer, no one asserts its permissibility, God willing.
Questioner: May Allah reward you.
The Shaykh: And you too.

P5458c - (implicit continuation): The foregoing is general guidance — if the imām memorizes little then permit him to read what is easy; otherwise the rule is rivalry for the Qurʾān and priority for the most learned in the Book.

P5459 - Questioner: Is the ḥadīth: "This knowledge will be carried by upright men from every generation" authentic?
The Shaykh: "This knowledge will be carried by upright men from every generation" — this ḥadīth lacks a ṣaḥīḥ (authentic) isnād (chain of narration) by consensus of the scholars. However, there are those who authenticated this ḥadīth by collecting its various paths; personally I once resolved to trace the chains to reach a personal conviction of its authenticity or to maintain its weakness, and this did not become feasible for me. Therefore whoever encounters a text from a reliable imām and he has authenticated it, he may follow him in that. Yes — go ahead.

P5460 - Questioner: Praise be to Allah, Lord of the worlds, and prayer and peace upon the chief of the Messengers and upon his family and companions all together. We request from our virtuous Shaykh — may Allah preserve him and prolong his life in righteous deeds — that he clarify for the Muslim who follows the Book and the Sunnah how he should rear his child. And we also request from our virtuous Shaykh that he clarify for us the ruling concerning many Muslim brothers who send their sons and daughters to missionary (Christian) schools and also send their children after the age of three to foreign governesses, especially Englishwomen, Frenchwomen and American women. May Allah bless you and reward you well.
Another questioner: … general teaching of children in Christian schools! Questioner: In addition, they graduate from secondary school and universities from these schools and many of them do not even know how to recite "Qul Huwa Allāhu Aḥad" (Say: He is Allah, the One).

P5460a - The Shaykh: All praise is due to Allah; we praise Him, seek His help and forgiveness, and seek refuge in Allah from the evils of our own souls and from the consequences of our deeds. Whoever Allah guides, none can misguide; and whoever He leaves astray, none can guide. I testify that there is no god but Allah alone without partner, and I testify that Muḥammad is His servant and Messenger. As for what follows:

P5460b - My brief answer to the mentioned question, then in detail: it is not permissible for a Muslim to entrust the apple of his eye and his beloved child to a kafir (infidel) caregiver who does not believe in Allah and His Messenger, because it is known both by sharʿ (religious law) and by experience that one who lacks something cannot give it. Whoever is a disbeliever in Allah and His Messenger, it is impossible that a child reared under the hand of these disbelievers will emerge other than a disbeliever like them. Hence the Prophet ﷺ said: "Every child is born upon the fitra (innate disposition) and then his parents make him a Jew or a Christian or a Magian." What first comes to mind from this ḥadīth and what it indicates by implication are two things. What the ḥadīth explicitly indicates is that if the child’s father is Jewish or Christian or Magian, he will make his child Jewish or Christian or Magian. But the ḥadīth has another implication when considered with Allah’s saying: "Protect yourselves and your families from a Fire whose fuel is men and stones..." If we combine this noble verse with that authentic ḥadīth, a juristic outcome emerges from the ḥadīth that a Muslim father may cause his child to become Jewish or Christian or Magian and it is correct to say that he may render him impure (najis) even if it occurs without intent. Magianism is certainly impure like the other religions known today except Islām; as the Lord of mankind said: "And whoever seeks a religion other than Islām it will never be accepted from him..." Thus we can understand from this ḥadīth that making the child a Christian does not require that the parent be Christian; rather the parent may be among those so-called Muslims who are only nominally Muslim — on the civil register — whereas the true Muslim cares for his child’s upbringing, firstly in obedience to his Lord’s command: "Protect yourselves and your families from the Fire," and secondly out of regard for his child’s future welfare. If the child is placed under the care of a Christian disbeliever, his fate will assuredly be one of two: either he becomes Christian or he becomes an atheist; he will neither be a true Muslim nor a Christian. We do not intend to prefer Christianity over Magianism; all disbelief is one creed; but certainly atheism is worse than the other misled creeds, as in the case of deviations like communism and the like. Thus it becomes clear without concealment that if a believing parent is responsible for rearing his child, he must not entrust the upbringing of his child — especially while the child is in tender years — to a disbeliever who does not believe in Allah and the Last Day.

P5461 - The Shaykh: … And I wonder how the conscience of a true believer father is appeased if he hears the verse: "Fight those who do not believe in Allah nor in the Last Day and who do not forbid what Allah and His Messenger have forbidden and who do not follow the religion of truth from among those who were given the Book until they give the jizyah with their hands and are subdued." I ask: how can a believing father allow himself to hand over the apple of his eye to his manifest enemy to rear him and teach him? What would he teach him? Perhaps their excuse is that the child learns a foreign tongue — English for example — we do not deny that Islām does not forbid a Muslim from learning another people's language, especially if that people are inimical to the Muslim nation; Islām does not forbid learning languages and even commands it as a communal obligation (farḍ kifāyah) if learning it benefits the nation collectively. We do not base this on the apocryphal ḥadīth "Whoever learns the language of a people will be safe from their deceit" for that ḥadīth has no foundation. Rather we rely on two matters: first, the juridical principle that whatever benefits the community to learn is a collective duty; second, that it is reported in the Sunnah that the Prophet ﷺ commanded Zayd b. Thābit to learn Syriac and he learned it in half a month. So we do not deny the Muslim the learning of that tongue, but firstly not at the expense of the Arabic language, and secondly — and this is most important — not at the cost of losing Islamic upbringing. Thus those who put their children in these foreign schools, whether English or French, are like the old saying: "He who builds a palace and destroys a fortress." They learn the foreign tongue and adopt some foreign manners and social customs; this harms them in the Muslim society rather than benefits them, and in the end they lose both worldly and religious good — that is manifest loss.

P5461a - What must be mentioned on this occasion is that many Islamic preachers do not hesitate to involve Muslims and cause them to fall into deviation from religion in belief or behavior under the claim that their children must learn what benefits them in their worldly lives. Many of these allow Muslim girls to attend universities to study, for example, medicine — and these studies in those universities are mixed (coeducational), where young men and young women intermingle, and from the temptation of that mingling there occurs things besides what either sex benefits from the study. They disregard the prophetic saying which should be considered a method in a Muslim’s conduct in all affairs of life in general and in rearing and educating his children in particular — namely the Prophet’s ﷺ saying: "The lawful is clear and the unlawful is clear and between them are doubtful matters which many people do not know; whoever avoids the doubtful has guarded his religion and honor; whoever falls into the doubtful falls into the unlawful. Know that every king has a sanctuary; verily the sanctuary of Allah is what He has prohibited; verily whoever keeps away from the sanctuary is near to falling into it." The point here is the Prophet’s ﷺ clause: "whoever keeps near the sanctuary is near to falling into it" — he ﷺ said this about doubtful matters; how then does a Muslim knowingly throw himself — if he is an adult — or throw his child not near the sanctuary but into the sanctuary itself under the pretext of some benefit? We say that this supposed benefit is not an individual obligatory duty (farḍ ʿayn) incumbent on every Muslim, and secondly this benefit is countered by harm, indeed harms, at least moral harms and perhaps also doctrinal harms. As we said above: those children who enter foreign schools to learn worldly sciences will emerge disbelievers in the end, either Christians or atheists. The Prophet ﷺ said: "Whoever keeps near the sanctuary is near to falling into it" — thus Muslim parents and Islamic preachers must never permit in any way nor issue fatwas permitting a child to enter a foreign (Christian) school to learn a foreign language there. Whoever issues such a ruling must know that the consequence for that pupil who graduates from the school is not only harm to himself but harm to his nation, for many Muslim rulers until recently were reared in foreign schools and imbibed colonial orientations.

P5461b - Therefore most of the present-day Muslim lands are ruled by men of that kind who were reared in foreign schools; Muslims today reap the fruits of the leniency of those parents who educated their children in foreign schools. The American University of Beirut — and those who know the history of that university know how far that is from them — has produced many Christian missionaries originally and many atheists whose origin is from Muslims; all these consequences result from neglecting the principle of proper child-rearing that is established by numerous texts. We have cited the verse: "Protect yourselves and your families from a Fire..." and the ḥadīth: "Every child is born upon the fitra..." Certainly the father who puts his child in foreign schools fails not only in regard to the verse and the ḥadīth but also in regard to the method ordained by Allah for parents in rearing children, such as the Prophet’s ﷺ instruction: "Command your children to perform ṣalāh (prayer) when they are seven years old, strike them for it when they are ten, and separate them in sleeping places." Certainly if a child reaches seven while being taught there what contradicts Islām he will not respond to his father's command to perform ṣalāh at seven, let alone that the father will be able to strike his son at ten if the schooling there teaches that striking is impermissible in child-rearing. How then can this father succeed in raising his child in an Islamic manner? Every Muslim should be warned: if he intends to place his child in a Christian school, the consequence before Allah is that he has prepared fuel for the Fire. Go ahead.
Questioner: They, O our Shaykh, claim that they teach Islamic religion as prescribed in the curricula of other Muslim schools; may Allah bless you — clarify and respond to that.
The Shaykh: First, when do they learn in those schools? Do they combine their study by attending both schools? I do not know in reality whether they combine attendance at the governmental school and at the Christian school. Suppose, for argument’s sake, that the instruction there is wholly Islamic — one hundred percent — that is not the case in reality; but even if one concedes that the governmental school is Islamic in its instruction, how do they combine that with study in the Christian school?

P5461c - Questioner: Yes, they employ Muslim teachers in those Christian schools to teach them Islām according to what the ministry prescribes.
The Shaykh: Then they are not governmental schools but Christian schools.
Questioner: In the same Christian school they of course employ a Muslim teacher.
The Shaykh: I understand now: the Christian school claims to follow the state syllabus and in addition has its own syllabus for teaching the foreign language and social manners and the like. We say: that neither nourishes nor suffices. We know that many Islamic preachers in Kuwait and elsewhere still protest the state curricula themselves because of their grave deviation, and in educating students therein non-Islamically. If the case is so in governmental schools where there are no Christian curricula, then in the Christian schools the matter is certainly worse.

P5461d - The summary: we advise every Muslim not to become entangled by placing his child in a Christian school because, at best, as we said, they have commanded fighting and opposing these people — and at least one should not entrust them with one's children. How can we entrust the upbringing of our children to these disbelievers? This is farthest from both sharʿ and reason. We ask Allah to guide all Muslims to return to their religion and the means of rearing their children in it so that Allah may dignify the Muslims after the humiliation that befell them due to their deviation from their religion. Allah, Blessed and Exalted, guides the righteous.
Questioner: May Allah reward you.
The Shaykh: And you too.
