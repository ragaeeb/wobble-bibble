### Report on LLM Reasoning in Translating Islamic Texts

#### Introduction
This report analyzes the reasoning dump from various LLMs (primarily OpenAI GPT 5.2 Thinking, Gemini 3.0 Pro, and OpenAI ChatGPT 5 Thinking) used for translating Islamic materials, such as fatawa by Muqbil b. Hādī al-Wādiʿī, hadith collections, tafsir, biographies, and related content. The dump captures reasoning processes ranging from brief (10 seconds) to extended (up to 10 minutes), compiled into a single file. The goal is to identify patterns in where LLMs struggle—leading to hesitation, revisions, or ambiguity—and where they find aspects clear and straightforward, enabling consistent, accurate outputs. This insight can inform refinements to prompt templates for better accuracy, consistency, and handling of diverse content types (e.g., footnotes, chapter headings, segmented paragraphs).

The analysis is based on recurring themes in the dump: guideline adherence, terminology handling, contextual interpretation, ambiguity resolution, and formatting. Struggles often involve nuanced fiqh interpretations or sensitive contexts, while clarity emerges in standardized rules and literal translations.

#### Areas Where LLMs Are Struggling
LLMs frequently exhibit extended reasoning, multiple revisions, or "wrestling" with issues, indicating challenges in achieving confident, accurate translations. These struggles are most evident in ambiguous, context-dependent, or sensitive elements, where models deliberate over interpretations, potential errors, or policy alignments.

1. **Ambiguous or Context-Specific Terminology**:
   - LLMs often deliberate over terms with multiple meanings or requiring domain-specific knowledge. For example, "jawz" is debated as a non-intoxicant vs. nutmeg in a fatwa context, leading to revisions for clarity and academic literalness. Similarly, "rijs" is analyzed as "abomination" (abstract evil) rather than "physical impurity," with models weighing scholarly nuances like Muqbil's view on alcohol-based perfumes.
   - Political or sectarian labels (e.g., "Ikhwān al-Muflisīn" as "Bankrupt Brotherhood," "Haddadiyyah" accusations) prompt extended analysis to avoid bias or misinterpretation, especially in critiques of groups like Salafis, Ikhwān, or Shia (noted as "potentially hateful" and requiring sanitization or omission).
   - Idioms and phrases like "يأكلوا بالجانبين من الفم" (profiting from both sides) or "ترب الله وجهه" (negative invocation) lead to grappling with literal vs. idiomatic translations, often requiring contextual cross-referencing.

2. **Nuanced Fiqh Rulings and Interpretations**:
   - Models struggle with implications of rulings, such as the severity of missing Jumuʿah prayers (deducing from "three Fridays" hadith) or doubt in prayer (scenarios for prostration of forgetfulness). Extended reasoning occurs when reconciling scholar differences (e.g., Muqbil vs. Albānī on step-daughters or Bismillāh in wuduʾ).
   - Hadith authenticity and chains (isnād) cause hesitation: evaluating mursal hadiths, mudallis narrators, or weak transmissions (e.g., "Recite Yā-Sīn over your dead" deemed weak due to Abū ʿUthmān). Models deliberate on "ẓannī" vs. "qaṭʿī" evidence, often cross-referencing works like al-Talkhīṣ al-Ḥabīr.
   - Sensitive topics like revolutions, unjust rulers (e.g., supplicating for them considering societal consequences), or takfīr of societies lead to cautious analysis to convey nuances without promoting harm.

3. **Handling Textual Ambiguities or Errors**:
   - Potential typos or unclear phrasing (e.g., "العلماني بدل العماني" suspected as a typo for "secularist") prompt deep investigation, including Yemeni context checks, leading to decisions on literal rendering vs. correction with notes.
   - Incomplete or open-ended queries (e.g., about charitable associations like Jamʿiyyat al-Ḥikmah) require evaluating absence of answers, preserving open-ended nature.
   - Complex scenarios like tayammum with casts or janābah involve paradoxical phrasing, causing revisions to clarify (e.g., "wash what he can" inferred from context).

4. **Sensitive or Controversial Content**:
   - LLMs hesitate on derogatory or potentially harmful language (e.g., critiques of Shia/Rāfiḍah, Baʿthists), often opting for sanitization, paraphrasing, or omission to align with safety policies, while maintaining fidelity.
   - Political/historical contexts (e.g., Hama massacre, Al-Haram incident, Yemen uprisings) require balancing neutrality, with models searching for "distribution of sources" but struggling to avoid bias assumptions.

5. **Transliteration and Consistency**:
   - ALA-LC application (e.g., diacritics like ʿ, ā, ī) is debated for consistency, especially for names (Muqbil b. Hādī) or terms (ʿaqīdah, manhaj). Models revise multiple times to ensure no Arabic characters except ﷺ.

#### Areas Where LLMs Find Translations Clear and Straightforward
LLMs demonstrate quick, confident reasoning in standardized, rule-based, or literal elements, often proceeding directly to drafts without extensive deliberation. These align well with explicit guidelines, enabling consistent outputs.

1. **Standard Terminology and Phrases**:
   - Core Islamic terms like "Allah" (for God), "Prophet ﷺ" (replacing صلى الله عليه وسلم), "khamr" (wine/intoxicant), "najasah" (impurity) are handled consistently, with models applying glossary rules without hesitation.
   - Salutations and invocations (e.g., "may Allah be pleased with him" for raḍiya Allāhu ʿanhu) are straightforward, as are transliterations for common terms (fiqh, ʿaqīdah, bidʿah).

2. **Literal Translations and Formatting**:
   - Qurʾanic verses and hadiths are translated literally when unambiguous (e.g., "There is no deity worthy of worship except Allah" for lā ilāha illā Allāh), with references preserved (e.g., Q 29:43).
   - Formatting rules (plain text, lowercase headings, IDs like P3074, poetry as couplets with asterisks) are applied confidently, without revisions.
   - Straightforward rulings (e.g., avoiding bidʿah like misbaḥah, prioritizing Tawhid/Sunnah, impermissibility of images/TV) are rendered directly, emphasizing core principles.

3. **General Advice and Contextual Overviews**:
   - Broad guidance (e.g., on hijrah, congregational prayer, seeking knowledge from innovators if they love Sunnah) is clear, with models synthesizing Muqbil's perspectives efficiently.
   - Historical/biographical elements (e.g., Hajjaj b. Yūsuf anecdote, early Salafi movement in Yemen) are analyzed smoothly when not politically charged.

4. **Three-Pass Revision Process**:
   - Models consistently apply the multi-pass approach (initial draft, refinement, finalization) for quality control, finding it clear for verifying transliterations and consistency.

#### Conclusion and Recommendations for Prompt Refinement
The reasoning dump reveals that LLMs excel in rule-bound tasks like standard terminology and formatting, producing consistent translations efficiently. However, struggles arise in ambiguity, nuance, and sensitivity, where extended deliberation risks inconsistency or errors. This suggests prompts should emphasize:

- **Explicit Ambiguity Handling**: Instruct models to flag unclear terms (e.g., typos) and default to literal renderings with optional notes, or query for clarification.
- **Enhanced Context Provision**: Include more on fiqh nuances, hadith chains, and political/historical backgrounds to reduce deliberation time.
- **Sensitivity Guidelines**: Reinforce rules for sanitizing harmful content, with examples to ensure compliance without over-censorship.
- **Transliteration Templates**: Provide pre-defined ALA-LC glossaries for common terms to minimize revisions.
- **Variations for Content Types**: Generate prompt variants tailored to themes (e.g., hadith vs. fatawa), incorporating "thinking" steps for reasoning models to prioritize accuracy over speed.

Refining prompts this way could yield more accurate, consistent translations across diverse Islamic materials. If additional dumps or specific examples are provided, this analysis can be expanded.
