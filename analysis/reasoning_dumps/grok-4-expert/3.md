# Report on LLM Reasoning in Translating Islamic Materials

## Overview
This report analyzes the provided reasoning dump from various LLMs (e.g., OpenAI GPT 5.2 Thinking, Gemini 3.0 Pro, OpenAI ChatGPT 5 Thinking) used for translating diverse Islamic texts, including Hadith collections, tafsir (Quranic exegesis), fatawa (legal opinions), biographies, narrator evaluations (jarh wa ta'dil), and fiqh (jurisprudence) treatises. The dump captures reasoning processes ranging from brief (10 seconds) to extended (10 minutes), aggregated across models and translation tasks.

The analysis identifies patterns in where LLMs struggle—often with ambiguity, nuance, or technical consistency—and where they perform clearly and confidently, such as with straightforward narratives or standard terms. These insights can inform prompt refinements for more accurate, consistent translations, emphasizing guidelines for handling complexities like transliteration, legal debates, and source variants.

## Areas Where LLMs Struggle
LLMs frequently revisit, revise, or express uncertainty in reasoning steps related to the following, indicating challenges in achieving precision without multiple iterations or external verification:

- **Transliteration and Name Consistency (ALA-LC Application):** Extensive revisions for narrator names and terms, often due to variants, typos, or diacritic ambiguities in sources. Examples include debating "al-Marwadhī" vs. "al-Marūdhī," "al-Nahzawānī" vs. "al-Nahrawānī," "Ibn Zabīb" vs. "Ibn Zabībā," and "Jīlī" variations. LLMs cross-reference authoritative sources but struggle with uniformity across long lists (e.g., Chapters 12+ in Imam Ahmad's biography), leading to time-consuming checks.

- **Nuanced Arabic Terminology and Polysemy:** Difficulty resolving words with multiple meanings, especially in legal or contextual shades. Examples: "la yan'iq" (trade/market context), "musri'an" (haste), "unsituha" (memory lapse), "lam yatasannah" (did not change/stink/decay), "mawaridiha" (courses/paths). In fiqh, struggles with "ta'wīl" (interpretation conditions), "mafḥūm al-muwāfaqah/mukhālafah" (implications), "bayān" (clarification delay), and "ḥaqīqah/majāz" (literal/metaphorical). LLMs debate linguistic vs. legal usage, often requiring multiple refinements.

- **Isnad (Narration Chains) Accuracy and Variations:** Tracing and verifying chains, handling discrepancies (e.g., differing paths from Ibn Abbas or Anas), and ensuring completeness. Challenges arise in Hadith texts like Sahih Ibn Khuzaymah or Musnad al-Shafi'i, where LLMs revise for missing links (e.g., al-Hasan to 'Ubada) or variants (e.g., Bundar vs. Mu'ammal). This is compounded by contextual integration, like linking chains to matn (text) implications.

- **Legal Debates and School-Specific Nuances:** In usul al-fiqh (e.g., al-Shawkani) and fatawa (e.g., Fatāwá al-Hindīyyah, al-Umm), uncertainty in reconciling opinions (Hanafi vs. Shafi'i, majority vs. minority). Examples: Validity of "mafḥūm al-mukhālafah" (divergent implication), abrogation (naskh), divorce intent (e.g., "al-battah," khulʿ conditions), manumission phrases (iḍāfah vs. tanwīn). LLMs grapple with intent, conditions, and evolutions (e.g., punishment changes from Prophet to Caliphs).

- **Ambiguities in Context, Intent, and Symbolism:** Hypothetical scenarios or symbolic narratives cause revisions. Examples: Prophet's actions (e.g., interlaced fingers, prostration postures like "iq‘ā’" or "muntaṣibatān"), revival stories (Jeremiah's donkey, order of resurrection), ambiguity in verses (e.g., "mistake and forgetfulness lifted" as sin vs. ruling). LLMs debate literal vs. intended meanings, especially in tafsir (e.g., Tafsīr al-Ṭabarī on "lam yatasannah").

- **Source Variants, Typos, and Verse/Hadith Discrepancies:** Handling misquotes (e.g., verse references like Al-Hujurat:5 vs. actual), scribal errors (e.g., "lā ḥaqqa" in al-Umm), or incomplete texts. In biographies and Musannaf, LLMs resolve by cross-referencing but express caution about "factual fidelity" vs. literal adherence.

- **Formatting and Output Consistency:** Ensuring plain text, preserving IDs (e.g., P1687a, C563), removing markup, and consistent honorifics (ﷺ, Allah). LLMs iterate on this, especially in long dumps with mixed content (e.g., footnotes, chapter headings).

These struggles often lead to prolonged reasoning (up to 10 minutes) and multiple "passes" (e.g., alignment, context, transliteration revisions), suggesting prompts need clearer handling instructions for ambiguity.

## Areas That Are Very Clear for LLMs
LLMs demonstrate confidence and minimal revisions in straightforward, repetitive, or well-defined elements, processing them efficiently with clear outputs:

- **Literal Narratives and Simple Descriptions:** Direct stories or actions, like Prophet's eating habits (e.g., grilled shoulder, no ablution after), journeys (e.g., to Mecca), or basic supplications (e.g., dua against Dajjal, distress dua). LLMs handle these faithfully, focusing on "precise rendering" without much debate.

- **Standard Islamic Terminology:** Common terms like "hadith," "isnad," "dua," "sunnah," "haram," "nabidh," "khamr," "hadd," "zakat," "rak'ah," "tasbih." Clear when no polysemy (e.g., "Glory be to my Lord the Great"), and LLMs consistently apply guidelines (e.g., "Allah" for God, ﷺ for blessings).

- **Biographical Structures and Chapter Headings:** Organizing and translating lists (e.g., Imam Ahmad's chapters on birth, lineage, scholars, devotions). LLMs confidently enumerate themes, preserving structure without variants complicating matters.

- **Basic Prohibitions and Rules:** Clear-cut rulings, like vessel prohibitions (Dubbāʾ, Muzaffat), intoxicant bans, or prayer recitations (e.g., Bismillah silently, Al-Fatiha in rak'ahs). When no evolution or debate, LLMs translate directly (e.g., "Every intoxicant is khamr").

- **Physical Descriptions in Rituals:** Standard prayer postures (e.g., prostration palms, elbows raised, heels joined) or actions (e.g., breaking fast publicly). LLMs describe these sequentially without ambiguity.

- **Iterative Processes and Guidelines Adherence:** LLMs clearly follow structured steps (e.g., "three revisions: alignment, context, transliteration"), prioritizing accuracy, plain text, and IDs. Confidence in cross-referencing when sources align (e.g., verse integrations without discrepancies).

These areas show quick resolution (often 10s of seconds), with LLMs producing "faithful" outputs without extensive grappling.

## Recommendations for Prompt Refinement
To leverage strengths and mitigate struggles, refine prompts as follows:

- **Provide Glossaries and Examples:** Include predefined lists for ambiguous terms (e.g., fiqh glossary with legal/linguistic distinctions) and ALA-LC examples for names to reduce transliteration iterations.

- **Instruct on Variants/Ambiguities:** Specify rules for handling source typos (e.g., "correct based on context if accuracy requires") or variants (e.g., "prioritize standard forms from authoritative sources").

- **Emphasize Step-by-Step Reasoning:** Mandate structured passes (e.g., "First: Analyze isnad; Second: Resolve terms; Third: Integrate context") to guide through complexities like legal debates.

- **Contextual Guidance:** For symbolic/ambiguous content, add "Balance literal and intended fiqh meaning, citing school differences if relevant."

- **Format Templates:** Supply output templates (e.g., "Preserve IDs, plain text only") to minimize formatting revisions.

- **Model-Specific Tweaks:** For thinking models, encourage "Assume good intent in source; revise only if evidence of error" to avoid over-correction.

This refined approach should yield more consistent, accurate translations across varied Islamic content.
