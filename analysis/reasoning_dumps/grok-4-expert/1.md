### Report on LLM Reasoning in Translating Islamic Material

#### Overview
This report analyzes the reasoning outputs from multiple LLMs (primarily OpenAI GPT 5.2 Thinking, Gemini 3.0 Pro, and OpenAI ChatGPT 5 Thinking) when translating Islamic texts such as hadiths, tafsirs, fatawa, biographies, and narrator evaluations. The dump reveals patterns in how LLMs interpret and apply translation instructions, highlighting areas of confusion (struggles) and areas of consensus (clear aspects). Struggles often stem from ambiguities in the prompt template regarding boundaries (e.g., when to apply rules), leading to inconsistent decisions. Clear aspects involve straightforward rules that LLMs apply uniformly without debate. Insights are drawn directly from the dump's repetitive discussions, debates, and self-corrections across models. Recommendations for prompt refinement are provided at the end to improve accuracy and consistency.

#### Areas Where LLMs Struggle
The dump shows LLMs frequently debating, revising, or seeking clarification on certain rules, leading to variability in outputs. This indicates prompt ambiguities that cause hesitation or overthinking, especially in balancing fidelity to the text with the instructions' restrictions.

1. **Transliteration Scope and Application**:
   - LLMs consistently struggle with when and where to apply ALA-LC transliteration with diacritics. The instruction limits it to "narrator names in the chain" (isnad), but models debate extensions to biographies, matn (hadith text), proper nouns (e.g., surah names like al-Tawbah or al-Baqarah), place names (e.g., Arafah, Mina, Muzdalifah), and technical terms (e.g., thiqah, saduq, tamattu', qiran, ihram).
   - Examples: Models question if names in commentaries or biographies "count as part of the chain" (e.g., "Narrator names in brackets, like '[Musaddad narrated to us],' will still count as part of the chain"). They often revise decisions, like avoiding diacritics for non-chain names (e.g., "al-Bukhari" without diacritics) but then debating for clarity (e.g., "use diacritics where needed for names, like 'Muḥammad'"). This leads to inconsistency, with some models using common English forms (e.g., "Umar") and others ALA-LC (e.g., "ʿUmar").
   - Impact: Prolonged reasoning (up to 10 minutes per segment), multiple revisions, and potential errors in final translations due to unclear boundaries.

2. **Handling Technical Terms (Translation vs. Transliteration)**:
   - Confusion arises on whether to translate terms like thiqah ("trustworthy"), saduq ("truthful, may err"), munkar ("denounced"), or keep them transliterated. Models debate if these are "narrator evaluations" (translate) or "technical terms" (transliterate without diacritics, e.g., "thiqah" plain).
   - Examples: "For terms like 'thiqah,' I'll use transliteration without diacritics according to the user's preference" vs. "translate terms like 'thiqah' as 'trustworthy'". Similar debates for fiqh terms (e.g., tawaf al-ifadah as "circumambulation of ifadah" or "farewell circumambulation"). Models often self-correct, e.g., "avoid transliterating Islamic technical terms like 'tamattuʿ' and 'qirān'".
   - Impact: Inconsistent outputs; models spend time "balancing between technical accuracy and maintaining clarity," leading to over-transliteration or over-translation.

3. **Diacritics and Arabic Characters**:
   - Models struggle with diacritics' use beyond narrator names, debating if for clarity in terms like "ḥadīth" or "isnād" (e.g., "technical terms like 'ḥadīth' will include diacritics, as it's not a name"). They also question avoiding Arabic characters except ﷺ, but sometimes include digits or punctuation (e.g., converting Arabic-Indic digits to Latin).
   - Examples: "Avoid Arabic characters and Arabic punctuation like commas and parentheses" but then debating for citations (e.g., "[التوبة:٣٧]" as "[al-Tawbah:37]"). Models revise: "Arabic-Indic digits like [٢٢٩] will be converted to Latin digits."
   - Impact: Frequent revisions and "grappling" with rules, as models worry about "violating rules" while aiming for readability.

4. **Surah Names and Quranic References**:
   - Debate on translating surah names (e.g., "Repentance" for al-Tawbah) vs. transliterating (e.g., "al-Tawbah"), and handling references (e.g., "[Qur'an 9:37]" vs. "[al-Tawbah:37]").
   - Examples: "For surah names like 'Āl ʿImrān,' use English versions with no Arabic characters, like 'Al 'Imran'." Models often switch: "translate Surah names, like 'Repentance' for al-Tawbah."
   - Impact: Inconsistency in handling verses; models spend time "clarifying transliteration and citation choices."

5. **Formatting, Citations, and Consistency**:
   - Models struggle with plain text vs. citations (e.g., "include filecite at the end" but "avoid markdown"). Debates on including web citations or only file ones.
   - Examples: "Citations should be placed at the end, perhaps last paragraph" but "the user wants plain text without markdown, so I’ll append it at the end."
   - Impact: Overthinking structure, leading to "tricky" decisions and revisions for consistency across segments.

#### Areas That Are Very Clear
LLMs demonstrate strong consensus and minimal debate in these areas, indicating well-defined prompt elements that lead to consistent outputs.

1. **Use of ﷺ for the Prophet**:
   - Uniformly applied for salutations like "صلى الله عليه وسلم" or "عليه الصلاة والسلام". No debate; models replace with ﷺ without hesitation.
   - Examples: "For the Prophet, I’ll use ﷺ" or "replace 'صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم' with ﷺ."

2. **Translation of "Allah" Instead of "God"**:
   - Consistently used, except for generic "ilah" as "deity". Models apply this rule without question.
   - Examples: "Translate 'الله' as 'Allah,' not as 'God,' unless it's referring to a generic deity."

3. **Honorifics for Companions and Scholars**:
   - Clear application: "رضي الله عنه" as "may Allah be pleased with him," "رحمه الله تعالى" as "may Allah have mercy on him."
   - Examples: "Translate 'رضي الله عنه' as 'may Allah be pleased with him' and maintain parentheses."

4. **Preservation of Structure (IDs, Chains, Citations)**:
   - Models consistently keep IDs at the start, preserve full isnad chains, and add citations at the end without Arabic.
   - Examples: "Keep the IDs, such as P6326, and include the filecite at the end" or "preserve the full isnad and be sure not to transliterate non-narrator elements like ﷺ."

5. **General Translation of Content**:
   - Straightforward for non-technical content: Translate Arabic into English, avoiding script except ﷺ. Models handle verses, supplications, and headings uniformly.
   - Examples: "Translate phrases like 'قال المصنف رحمه الله تعالى' as 'The compiler, may Allah have mercy on him, said:'" or "translate Qur'anic verses into English and include the bracketed reference."

#### Recommendations for Prompt Refinement
To address struggles and enhance consistency, refine the prompt template as follows:
- **Explicit Boundaries for Transliteration**: Specify "ALA-LC diacritics ONLY for narrator names in isnad chains; use common English forms without diacritics for all else (e.g., places, surahs, technical terms). Do not transliterate technical terms—translate them (e.g., thiqah as 'trustworthy')."
- **List of Common Terms**: Provide a glossary for frequent terms (e.g., ihram as "state of ritual consecration," tamattu' as "Hajj with a break for Umrah").
- **Surah and Verse Handling**: "Translate surah names (e.g., al-Tawbah as 'Repentance'); use numeric references (e.g., [Qur'an 9:37])."
- **Citations and Formatting**: "Append citations in plain text at the end of each segment (e.g., SOURCE: filecite...); no brackets or Arabic."
- **Encourage Minimal Reasoning**: Add "Follow rules without over-debate; if unclear, default to translation over transliteration for non-chain elements."
These changes could reduce reasoning time (from 10s-10min to shorter) and minimize inconsistencies, leading to more reliable translations.
