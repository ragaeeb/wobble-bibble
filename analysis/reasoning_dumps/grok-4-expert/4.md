### Report on LLM Reasoning in Translating Islamic Texts

This report analyzes the provided reasoning dump from various LLMs (primarily OpenAI GPT 5.2 Thinking, Gemini 3.0 Pro, and OpenAI ChatGPT 5 Thinking) used for translating Islamic materials, including fiqh texts (e.g., al-Umm by al-Shāfiʿī), biographical works (e.g., Siyar A'lam al-Nubala by al-Dhahabi, Tahdhib al-Kamal by al-Mizzi), tafsir (e.g., Jāmiʿ al-Bayān by al-Ṭabarī), hadith collections (e.g., Musnad al-Shāfiʿī), and other genres like jarh wa ta'dil evaluations (e.g., al-Ḍuʿafāʾ al-Kabīr by al-ʿUqaylī). The dump shows reasoning durations from seconds to minutes, aggregated across models and translation sessions.

The analysis identifies **struggle areas** (where LLMs exhibit repeated revisions, reevaluations, uncertainty, or focus on ambiguities, indicating challenges in achieving accuracy and consistency) and **clear areas** (where reasoning proceeds smoothly, with confident handling and minimal iteration, suggesting reliable performance). Patterns are derived from recurring themes, such as fiqh nuances, textual variants, and formatting constraints. Overall, LLMs excel at structural preservation but falter on interpretive ambiguities, especially in fiqh and textual criticism, often requiring multiple "passes" or "revisions" to resolve.

#### 1. Struggle Areas
LLMs frequently revisit certain elements, indicating difficulties in interpretation, disambiguation, or balancing literal fidelity with contextual meaning. This leads to inconsistent outputs across sessions (e.g., varying translations of the same phrase) and prolonged reasoning, as models "reevaluate" or "refine" to align with fiqh rules or suspected errors.

- **Suspected Scribal Errors and Textual Variants**: 
  - The phrase "lā ḥaqqa" in segment P12293 from al-Umm (on invalid marriages, e.g., murtadd cases) is a major pain point. Models repeatedly suspect it as a "scribal error" and debate translations like "legitimate" vs. literal renderings, weighing fiqh interpretations (e.g., child's legitimacy). This appears in over 30 entries, with phrases like "reevaluating scribal errors," "choosing to translate based on standard interpretations," or "despite its literal issues." Struggles arise from conflicting literal text vs. contextual fiqh, leading to indecision on whether to "preserve textual integrity" or correct for meaning.
  - Similar issues with Quranic variants (e.g., "Al-Qāniṭīn" vs. "Al-Qaniṭīn" in tafsir of Al-Hijr) or hadith discrepancies (e.g., dates like "180" vs. "86" for Aḥmad ibn Ḥanbal's travels in biographical texts). Models "reconcile apparent contradictions" or "investigate chronological anomalies," showing uncertainty in source reliability.

- **Nuanced Fiqh and Legal Rulings**:
  - Terms like dhimmah, jizyah, ṣulḥ, and ḍiyāfah in al-Umm (e.g., treaty obligations, hospitality for Ahl al-Dhimmah) prompt extensive focus on "legal implications," "historical precedents," and "Imām's role." Models conduct "multiple drafts" or "sectional translations" (e.g., P10701–P10742), emphasizing "adhering to numeric prefixes and narrative chains." Challenges include balancing literal translation with "preserving the original intent," especially in rulings on movement, protection, or interactions with Ahl al-Ḥarb.
  - In jarh wa ta'dil contexts (e.g., Tahdhib al-Kamal), evaluating narrator reliability (thiqah, ḍaʿīf, ṣadūq) involves "classifying narrators" and "reconciling discrepancies," with repeated "comparative analyses" (e.g., Yaḥyā ibn Saʿīd al-Qaṭṭān vs. others). Models struggle with "nuanced views" or "contrasting opinions," often "double-checking" for consistency.

- **Disambiguating Names, Lineages, and Chronologies**:
  - Biographical texts show frequent "tracing lineages" or "confirming identities" (e.g., Aḥmad ibn Shabawayh's death dates, or distinguishing Yaḥyā variants). Models "cross-reference sources" for "discrepancies," indicating challenges with homonymous narrators or incomplete data.
  - In historical/political contexts (e.g., Siyar A'lam al-Nubala on Al-Nasir's reign, Third Crusade), models "map events" or "unpack intrigue," struggling with "chronological anomalies" or "political climate" interpretations.

- **Balancing Literal vs. Meaning-Based Translation**:
  - Ambiguous phrases (e.g., "play with his arrows" in hadith as "train" vs. literal; "Sadūsīs" as inaccurate claim) lead to "navigating textual quirks" or "interpreting semantic ambiguity." Models debate "implied meaning" vs. "literal interpretation," especially in ethical dilemmas (e.g., martyrdom virtues in hadith).
  - Takfīr debates or ijtihad delegation in fiqh texts (e.g., Irshād al-Fuḥūl) involve "unpacking nuances" and "comparing viewpoints" (Ashʿarī vs. Muʿtazilah), with repeated "grappling" over implications like sinfulness or correctness.

- **Transliteration and Formatting Edge Cases**:
  - ALA-LC application is inconsistent when ambiguous (e.g., "deciding on diacritics" for non-narrator terms like "wuḍūʾ" vs. "wudu"; book titles like "al-Kāfī"). Models "refine terminology choices" or "adjust for omissions," showing uncertainty beyond clear narrator names.
  - Handling nested isnads or missing pages (e.g., P16901 in Tahdhib) prompts "verifying narrative accuracy" and "handling omissions."

These struggles often result in 3–4 "revision passes," with models "immersed in nuances" or "wrestling with debates," highlighting needs for better prompts on error-handling, fiqh expertise, and variant resolution.

#### 2. Clear Areas
LLMs handle these elements confidently, with straightforward progression, minimal revisions, and consistent outputs. Reasoning flows linearly, focusing on "implementing guidelines" or "commencing first draft," indicating these are low-ambiguity tasks.

- **Preserving Structure and Formatting**:
  - Numeric prefixes (e.g., P10701), IDs (e.g., N354 in al-Ḍuʿafāʾ), and plain-text output are routinely "maintained" or "adhered to," with no hesitation. Models "preserve the original format" across genres, including chapter headings and table of contents.
  - Full isnad chains are "meticulously preserved" or "compiled," with smooth "tracing" in biographical/hadith texts. Nested narrations (e.g., in tafsir) are handled as "building upon evaluations" without issues.

- **Standard Transliteration for Clear Names**:
  - When unambiguous, ALA-LC for narrator names (e.g., Yaḥyā ibn Saʿīd, Aḥmad ibn Ḥanbal) is applied confidently, with "standardizing" or "refining" mentioned briefly. Models "transliterate extensive lists" (e.g., teachers/students) without reevaluation.

- **Common Islamic Phrases and Symbols**:
  - ﷺ for salawat, "Allah" for God, and phrases like "may Allah have mercy on him" are "integrated" seamlessly. Basic terms (e.g., hadith, sunnah, ummah) are translated without debate.

- **Straightforward Biographical or Narrative Details**:
  - Birth/death dates, praises (e.g., Aḥmad ibn Ḥanbal's accolades), and simple events (e.g., journeys, funerals in Siyar) are "cataloged" or "collated" efficiently. Models "document" without "grappling," as in "noting details" for Al-Nasir's spy network or Crusade events.

- **Basic Legal or Exegetical Summaries**:
  - Overviews of themes (e.g., martyrdom virtues in hadith, treaty stipulations in al-Umm) are "synthesized" or "finalized" quickly when no variants exist. Models "commence first draft" and proceed to "concluding," showing clarity in non-ambiguous rulings.

- **Workflow and Revision Processes**:
  - Structured steps like "first pass," "refining strategy," or "finalizing process" are executed consistently, with models "streamlining workflow" for efficiency in repetitive tasks (e.g., sectional translations).

These clear areas suggest LLMs perform well on rule-based, repetitive elements, where prompts can emphasize structure over interpretation.

#### Recommendations for Prompt Refinement
- **For Struggles**: Explicitly instruct on handling errors (e.g., "Prioritize literal text unless fiqh consensus indicates otherwise; cite sources for corrections"). Provide glossaries for fiqh/jarh terms and variant resolution rules. Encourage fewer revisions by mandating "single-pass decisions" for ambiguities.
- **For Clear Areas**: Reinforce with examples (e.g., "Always preserve isnads as [chain format]"). Limit ALA-LC to narrators only, clarifying exceptions.
- **General**: Specify content type upfront (e.g., "fiqh ruling" vs. "biography") to guide focus. Test variations with model-specific tweaks (e.g., more context for GPT models on fiqh).
