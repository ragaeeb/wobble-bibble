### Report on LLM Reasoning in Islamic Text Translation Tasks

#### Introduction
This report analyzes the provided reasoning dump from multiple LLMs (primarily OpenAI GPT 5.2 Thinking, Gemini 3.0 Pro, and OpenAI ChatGPT 5 Thinking) engaged in translating Islamic texts, such as Fatawa of Muqbil b. Hādī, Hadith collections, Tafsir, and related materials. The dump consists of iterative reasoning outputs across various segments, often lasting from seconds to minutes per task. The goal is to identify patterns in where LLMs struggle (leading to inconsistencies, errors, or repeated revisions) and where they excel (producing consistent, accurate outputs). Insights are derived from recurring themes in the reasoning logs, such as handling terminology, context, and guidelines. This will inform refinements to prompt templates for more accurate, consistent translations of diverse Islamic content (e.g., Hadith books, biographies, Jarh wa Ta'dil).

The analysis is based on ~150-200 reasoning entries in the dump, categorized by common challenges and strengths. Struggles often manifest as multiple revisions, debates over word choices, or admissions of ambiguity. Strengths appear as quick resolutions, confident drafts, and alignment with guidelines without backtracking.

#### Areas Where LLMs Struggle
The LLMs frequently encounter difficulties in complex, context-dependent aspects of translation, leading to prolonged reasoning, repeated drafts, or inconsistent outputs. These struggles stem from the need to balance literal accuracy, cultural/religious nuance, and adherence to guidelines (e.g., ALA-LC transliteration, no Arabic script except ﷺ).

1. **Technical Islamic Terminology and Transliteration**:
   - LLMs often revise terms like "jarh wa ta'dil" (criticism and praise of narrators), "bid'ah" (innovation), "kufr bawāḥ" (manifest disbelief), "tawḥīd al-ḥākimiyyah" (unity of sovereignty), and "ḥizbiyyah" (partisanship). They struggle with deciding when to transliterate vs. translate (e.g., "bid'ah mukaffirah" as "disbelieving innovation" or "innovation leading to takfīr"), leading to back-and-forth on precision.
   - ALA-LC transliteration causes repeated checks (e.g., "Muqbil b. Hādī al-Wādiʿī" vs. variants like "al-Wadi'i"). Logs show confusion over diacritics (e.g., ḥ vs. h, ʿ vs. '), especially for names (e.g., "al-Shawkānī" or "Shawkani") or terms like "qaṭʿ al-ṭarīq" (highway robbery).
   - Example: In segments on "kufr" interpretations, LLMs debate between "disbelief" and "manifest unbelief," revising 3-5 times due to theological sensitivity.
   - Impact: This leads to overthinking, with ~30% of entries involving multiple "refining" or "revising" steps, reducing efficiency for consistent prompts.

2. **Handling Typos, Corrupted, or Ambiguous Source Text**:
   - The dump shows frequent struggles with source errors (e.g., "thawrihā" as "her revolution" vs. "her bull," or "أبى" as "refuses" vs. "regains consciousness"). LLMs spend time "resolving textual anomalies" or assuming typos, leading to speculative revisions.
   - Obscure Yemeni dialects or idioms (e.g., "ṣamīlah" as "moustache" vs. "club/staff," "zanj" as "bricks" vs. "people") cause repeated "grappling" or "investigating," with logs admitting "uncertainty" or "hesitance to deviate."
   - Example: Corrupted Hadith narrations (e.g., inverted subject-object in spousal rights) prompt "textual discrepancy" debates, with 10-15% of entries involving reconstruction attempts.
   - Impact: Prompts need better handling of imperfect sources; LLMs often overcorrect or hesitate, prolonging reasoning (up to 10 minutes in dumps).

3. **Nuanced Interpretations and Contextual Sensitivity**:
   - LLMs struggle with fiqh rulings involving intent/emotion (e.g., oaths/divorces in anger, "ighlaq" as emotional distress). They revise drafts to balance "literal" vs. "meaning-based" (e.g., triple divorce counting as one or three).
   - Sensitive topics like violence (e.g., "suicide operations," "khurūj against rulers," "taʿzīr punishment") lead to cautious phrasing, with logs noting "ethical implications" or "careful handling."
   - Historical/theological contexts (e.g., Salafi critiques of Ikhwan al-Muslimīn as "Bankrupt Brotherhood," or Shi'a as "Rāfiḍah") cause debates on tone (e.g., preserving "derogatory" intent without exaggeration).
   - Example: In Jarh wa Ta'dil discussions, LLMs debate "yukaffir" as "invents" vs. "declares kufr," revising for context.
   - Impact: ~40% of entries involve "grappling with nuances" or "revising for precision," indicating prompts should include more explicit contextual anchors.

4. **Poetry, Idioms, and Cultural References**:
   - Poetry (e.g., lines from al-Ṣanʿānī or Ibn al-Jazarī) prompts multiple drafts for rhyme/flow vs. literal meaning, with logs admitting "challenges in capturing essence."
   - Idioms (e.g., "with the boots of Hunayn" as "empty-handed," "the branch is lesser than the root") lead to "investigating" or "grappling," as LLMs debate cultural equivalents.
   - Cultural references (e.g., Yemeni practices like qāt chewing, "shammah" as snuff) require "contextual research" simulations, causing delays.
   - Impact: These areas show 20% of reasoning time spent on revisions, suggesting prompts need examples or glossaries for idioms/poetry.

5. **File/PDF Handling and Long Texts**:
   - When dumps mention "truncated files" or "search_pdf_attachment," LLMs simulate tool use but struggle with incomplete data, leading to "assuming" or "leaving as is."
   - Long dumps cause fragmented reasoning, with entries "immersed in details" but repeating revisions.
   - Impact: Indicates prompts should specify tools for large texts.

#### Areas Where LLMs Perform Well
LLMs demonstrate strong consistency in straightforward, rule-based, or evidence-supported tasks, often resolving quickly (10s-1min) with minimal revisions. These areas align with clear guidelines or factual content.

1. **Straightforward Factual Translations and Rulings**:
   - Simple Hadith/Quran translations (e.g., "There is no deity but Allah," "Come to prayer") are handled confidently, with quick drafts and few revisions.
   - Clear rulings (e.g., Zakat al-Fitr in grain not cash, prayer timing exceptions) draw directly from evidence, leading to "confident" outputs.
   - Example: In fasting/vows, LLMs efficiently cite verses/Hadith without ambiguity.
   - Impact: ~30% of entries resolve fast, showing strength in evidence-based tasks.

2. **Adherence to Explicit Guidelines**:
   - When prompts provide clear rules (e.g., ALA-LC, "Allah" vs. "God," no Arabic script), LLMs "solidify" and apply them consistently, e.g., revising once for compliance.
   - Formatting (e.g., preserving IDs, plain text) is handled well, with logs noting "adhering strictly."
   - Example: Transliterations like "Muqbil b. Hādī al-Wādiʿī" are standardized early.
   - Impact: Reduces errors in structured tasks, indicating prompts with explicit rules enhance performance.

3. **General Advice and Ethical Guidance**:
   - Non-controversial advice (e.g., parental kindness, seeking knowledge, marital harmony) is translated smoothly, with "quick resolutions" and positive tone preservation.
   - Logs show ease in "synthesizing" themes like unity, patience, or avoiding fitnah.
   - Example: Segments on memorization techniques or balancing duties show confident, structured outputs.
   - Impact: ~25% of entries are "immersed" but resolve without struggle, highlighting strength in advisory content.

4. **Factual Historical or Biographical References**:
   - References to scholars (e.g., Ibn Taymiyyah, al-Shawkānī) or events (e.g., Uhud, Hunayn) are recalled and translated accurately, with minimal debate.
   - Logs note "drawing from precedents" efficiently.
   - Impact: Aids in contextual tasks when evidence is unambiguous.

#### Recommendations for Prompt Template Refinement
To improve LLM performance in translating Islamic texts:

1. **Enhance Terminology Handling**: Include a glossary of key terms (e.g., bid'ah, kufr) with preferred transliterations/translations in prompts. Add examples for nuances (e.g., "kufr bawāḥ" as "manifest disbelief").

2. **Address Ambiguities**: Instruct LLMs to flag typos/corruptions and suggest corrections based on context, with a "propose alternative" step. Provide fallback rules for idioms/poetry (e.g., "prioritize literal, then idiomatic equivalent").

3. **Strengthen Contextual Guidance**: Require prompts to specify content type (e.g., Fatawa vs. Hadith) and audience (e.g., Salafi experts). Include "think step-by-step" chains for sensitive topics, with ethical reminders.

4. **Leverage Tools**: For long/truncated texts, integrate search_pdf_attachment or code_execution prompts to extract/process data.

5. **Iterative Testing**: Use variations with explicit rules for struggles (e.g., "Revise 3 times: literal, contextual, final"). Test on diverse themes (e.g., Jarh wa Ta'dil vs. biographies) to balance strengths.

This refinement should yield more consistent, accurate translations, minimizing struggles while leveraging strengths.
