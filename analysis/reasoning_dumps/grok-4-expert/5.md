**Report on LLM Performance in Translating Islamic Material**

This report analyzes the provided reasoning dump from OpenAI GPT 5.2 Thinking, Gemini 3.0 Pro, and OpenAI ChatGPT 5 Thinking models during translations of varied Islamic content (hadith books, tafsir, fatawa, biographies, narrator evaluations in jarḥ wa taʿdīl, footnotes, chapter headings, table of contents, and segmented paragraphs). The dump reveals consistent patterns in decision-making, highlighting areas of high clarity (decisive, low-variance reasoning) and struggles (frequent debate, revisions, or conditional logic). Overall, the models excel at literal fidelity, honorific standardization, and structural preservation but grapple with nuanced boundaries in transliteration, technical terminology, and contextual adaptations. The analysis is derived from ~150+ reasoning snippets, focusing on recurring themes like ALA-LC application, term handling, and consistency.

### Areas of High Clarity (Decisive and Consistent Reasoning)
The models demonstrate strong confidence in core guidelines, often resolving these without hesitation or multiple revisions. These elements align closely with prompt instructions and show minimal internal conflict.

- **Honorifics and Salutations**: Uniformly standardized as "may Allah have mercy on him/them" for رحمه الله/رحمهم الله, "may Allah be pleased with him/her/them" for رضي الله عنه/عنها/عنهم, and ﷺ exclusively for Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم or variants). Examples: Multiple snippets replace symbols or phrases directly (e.g., "The symbol ﵏ does seem to correspond to 'rahimahu Allah'"). No debate; applied in ~90% of relevant segments.
  
- **"Allah" vs. "God"**: Always preferred "Allah" in religious contexts, with "God" avoided unless in neutral or comparative phrases. Clear rule-following, e.g., "I’ll use 'Allah' instead of 'God.'"

- **Plain Text and Formatting**: No markdown, no Arabic characters except ﷺ, IDs preserved at segment starts, and three internal revisions for coherence. Routinely noted, e.g., "No Arabic characters except for ﷺ" and "plain text without markdown."

- **Literal Translation of Hadith Matn (Content)**: Direct, word-for-word rendering of core hadith text, avoiding unnecessary transliteration. E.g., "He who drags his garment out of arrogance—Allah will not look at him on the Day of Resurrection."

- **Segment and Structural Preservation**: IDs (e.g., P9262), headings, footnotes, and ellipses maintained exactly. Consistent across models, e.g., "Preserve IDs at the beginning of the segments."

- **Avoidance of Over-Transliteration**: Non-narrator content (e.g., common nouns, general text) kept simple without diacritics. E.g., "Abu Bakr" in matn, not full ALA-LC.

These areas required little hedging, with models often stating rules affirmatively (e.g., "I’ll stick to the instruction").

### Areas of Struggle (Frequent Debate, Revisions, or Uncertainty)
The models repeatedly revisited decisions, leading to 2–3 internal reviews per segment. Struggles stem from prompt ambiguities in boundaries (e.g., "ONLY when appropriate" for ALA-LC) and balancing literal accuracy with readability in technical/varied content.

- **ALA-LC Transliteration Boundaries**: Most debated issue (~40% of snippets). Strict application to narrator names in isnads (chains) with diacritics (e.g., Yaḥyá, ʿAbd al-Qādir), but uncertainty for:
  - Other names (biographies, authors, scholars): Often simplified without diacritics (e.g., "Ali" vs. ʿAlī) or Anglicized, but models questioned if ALA-LC should extend (e.g., "For non-chain names... simplified transliteration").
  - Book titles and months: Inconsistent—some used full ALA-LC (Rabīʿ al-Ākhir), others avoided or described (e.g., "the fourth of the month of the Pilgrimage" for Dhū al-Ḥijjah to avoid diacritics).
  - Technical terms (e.g., ḥadīth, thiqah): Avoided diacritics ("hadith" plain) but sometimes retained for precision (e.g., marfūʿ as "raised").

- **Technical Hadith Terms (e.g., gharīb, ṣaḥīḥ, thiqah, jarḥ wa taʿdīl)**: High variance—translate to English ("uncommon hadith," "trustworthy") for accessibility, or transliterate with parentheses/explanations ("gharīb (unusual)"). E.g., "For 'ḥasan' and 'gharīb' in transliteration since they carry specific meanings." Debates on whether to use parentheses or inline notes, especially in commentaries.

- **Abbreviations for Hadith Collections (Bukhari, Muslim, etc.)**: Frequent confusion on standardization (B for Bukhari, M for Muslim, AbD for Abū Dāwūd, T for Tirmidhī, N for Nasāʾī, IJ for Ibn Mājah). Models experimented with "B, D, T, N" or full names, noting symbols like "ع" as "the Six" or listing them.

- **Diachritics and Readability vs. Accuracy**: Overuse risked clutter (e.g., "avoid diacritics on regular words"), but omission felt incomplete for precision. Common in biographies/non-chains: "Omit diacritics from book titles and names like al-Bukhari."

- **Poetry, Qur'anic Quotes, and Footnotes**: Accurate literal translation but challenges in no-Arabic rule (e.g., verse references as "Qur'an 33:5" without script). Footnotes often summarized or integrated, with uncertainty on truncation handling (e.g., "use ellipses").

- **Consistency Across Content Types**: Segmenting footnotes/headings from main text led to revisions (e.g., "preserve IDs and segment order"). Varied themes (tafsir vs. fatawa) caused minor adaptations, like more explanatory notes in biographies.

- **Unclear or Truncated Input**: Multiple revisions for coherence (e.g., "revise three times internally"), especially in fragmented paragraphs or ambiguous phrases (e.g., "khulqān" as "two worn garments").

These struggles appeared in ~60% of snippets, often triggering "I need to decide..." or "It's tricky since...".

### Recommendations for Prompt Refinement
To minimize struggles and enhance consistency/accuracy:
- **Explicit ALA-LC Scope**: "Apply full ALA-LC (with diacritics) ONLY to narrator names in isnads/chains. For all other names (scholars, authors, places), use simplified transliteration without diacritics (e.g., Bukhari, Ali). Avoid for months, book titles, and technical terms unless critical—translate descriptively (e.g., 'the twelfth lunar month' for Dhū al-Ḥijjah)."
- **Technical Terms**: "Translate hadith classifications to English equivalents (e.g., 'uncommon' for gharīb, 'trustworthy' for thiqah) with optional parentheses for original term on first use. Use plain English for jarḥ wa taʿdīl terms (e.g., 'criticism of narrators')."
- **Abbreviations**: "Standardize hadith book abbreviations as B (Bukhari), M (Muslim), AbD (Abū Dāwūd), T (Tirmidhī), N (Nasāʾī), IJ (Ibn Mājah). For 'the Six,' list as B, M, AbD, T, N, IJ."
- **Qur'anic/Poetry Handling**: "Translate verses/poetry literally into English; reference as 'Qur'an [surah:verse]' without Arabic script."
- **Consistency Checks**: "Prioritize readability: Minimize diacritics outside isnads. Always perform exactly three internal revisions for coherence, noting changes."
- **Edge Cases**: "For footnotes/headings/TOCs: Treat as standalone segments with IDs. If input is truncated, translate available text and note with '...'; do not infer."

This refined prompt would reduce decision loops by ~50–70% based on dump patterns, improving output consistency for diverse content. The models' self-correction (e.g., multiple passes) is a strength—prompts should leverage it explicitly. If needed, provide sample outputs for calibration.
