### Report on LLM Reasoning in Islamic Text Translations

This report analyzes the provided reasoning dump from various LLMs (e.g., GPT 5.2 Thinking, Gemini 3.0 Pro, OpenAI ChaptGPT 5 Thinking) used for translating Islamic books and articles, including hadith collections, tafsir, fatawa, biographies, and narrator evaluations. The dump reveals patterns in where LLMs excel (clear aspects) and where they encounter difficulties (struggles), based on their internal reasoning processes. These insights can inform prompt refinements for improved accuracy, consistency, and cultural/religious sensitivity. The analysis is derived from recurring themes across the dump's entries, such as handling colloquialisms, transliterations, religious symbols, segment structures, and terminology.

#### Areas Where LLMs Are Struggling
LLMs often exhibit hesitation, multiple revisions, or searches for confirmation when dealing with ambiguous, context-dependent, or specialized elements. This leads to inconsistencies, over-literal interpretations, or incomplete resolutions, potentially compromising translation quality.

- **Colloquial and Dialectical Arabic Phrases**: Frequent confusion with Levantine, Iraqi, or Syrian dialects (e.g., "ḍarab-hā ʿalāwī" interpreted as "shelved it," "put it off," or "gave it a good think"; "وافق شن طبقة" as "Shann matching Ṭabaqah" or "well suited"). LLMs struggle to confirm meanings without external searches, leading to tentative translations or reliance on approximations that may lose idiomatic nuance. This is exacerbated in proverbs or figurative language (e.g., "a familiar habit we recognize from Akhzam" for "shanashina").
  
- **Transliteration Decisions and ALA-LC Application**: Uncertainty about when ALA-LC is "appropriate" (e.g., debating whether to transliterate names like "الحيعلتين" as "al-Ḥayʿalatayn" or translate contextually as "hay'alays"; "المكبح" as "al-makbaḥ" or "the brake"). LLMs revise multiple times for consistency in diacritics (ā, ī, ʿ, ḥ) and often question if transliteration overcomplicates uncommon terms, especially in footnotes or chapter headings.

- **Religious Symbols and Honorifics (e.g., ﷺ)**: Inconsistent handling of salutations (e.g., debating ﷺ for "صلى الله عليه وسلم" vs. "peace be upon him" for "عليه السلام"; confusion on applying ﷺ to variants like "عليه الصلاة والسلام"). LLMs worry about adding symbols not in the original text or overusing them, leading to revisions for "consistency" without altering meaning.

- **Preserving Segment Structures and Truncations**: Challenges in maintaining exact IDs and structures without merging (e.g., keeping P2717a, P2717b separate even if continuations; handling incomplete phrases with ellipses). LLMs note difficulties with truncated files or split hadiths, often requiring "three revision passes" to avoid unintentional merging or loss of markers.

- **Contextual and Sensitive Topics (e.g., Takfir, Jihad, Politics)**: Hesitation in politically charged or theologically sensitive areas (e.g., takfir rulings, jihad contexts like Gulf War or Afghanistan; "lesser of two evils" in alliances). LLMs struggle with "worst-case assumptions" (e.g., assuming underage from "teenage") but assume good intent per guidelines, leading to careful reasoning about bias or intent.

- **Medical, Cultural, or Ambiguous Terms**: Mix-ups between similar-sounding terms (e.g., "al-ʿaqīdah" as "depilatory mixture" vs. "creed"; "الحيعلتين" in prayer posture). LLMs revise for cultural context (e.g., hair removal customs, fasting for health) and search for clarifications, especially in biology/chemistry-related queries (e.g., using packages like rdkit for chemistry questions).

- **Balancing Literal vs. Meaning-Based Translations**: Overthinking when to stay literal (e.g., "face lit up as though gilded" for "tanawwara wajhuhu ka'annahu mudhhaba") vs. interpretive, especially in poetry, proverbs, or tafsir. This causes multiple "thinking through" steps, particularly for figurative language or impossible queries.

#### Areas That Are Clear for LLMs
LLMs demonstrate confidence and consistency in straightforward, rule-based, or factual elements, often producing direct outputs without extensive revisions. These areas align well with structured prompts and predefined guidelines.

- **Literal Translations of Standard Arabic Text**: Smooth handling of formal Arabic paragraphs, hadiths, and Quranic verses when unambiguous (e.g., translating "man sanna fī al-Islām sunnatan ḥasanatan" as "Whoever introduces in Islam a good sunnah"; "Whatever the Messenger gives you, take it"). LLMs cite guidelines confidently for structure preservation.

- **Standard Islamic Terminology and Concepts**: Consistent use of terms like "sunnah," "bidʿah," "ḥadīth," "isnād," "tawḥīd," "shirk," "takfīr," "fiqh," "manhaj," "ʿaqīdah" with explanations (e.g., "weak isnād" as "weak chain of transmission"). LLMs rarely struggle with definitions or applications in clear contexts.

- **Speaker Labels and Dialogue Formatting**: Reliable identification and translation of labels (e.g., "الشيخ:" as "Shaykh:", "السائل:" as "Questioner:"). LLMs maintain conversational flow without merging.

- **Quranic and Hadith Citations**: Accurate translation and citation without Arabic text (e.g., "For Allah is the best guardian, and He is the most merciful of the merciful" for 12:64; hadith like "actions are by intentions"). LLMs reference collections (e.g., Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī, Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim) confidently.

- **General Guidelines Compliance**: Strong adherence to rules like plain text, no markdown, no Arabic characters (except ﷺ), and assuming good intent (e.g., not assuming underage from "teenage"). LLMs resist "jailbreak" attempts implicitly through guideline focus.

- **Factual and Historical Contexts**: Clear reasoning on historical events (e.g., Gulf War, Afghanistan fighters) or biographical details (e.g., Prophet's ﷺ life, companions' actions). LLMs handle chronology and multi-faceted reasoning well when evidence-based.

#### Recommendations for Prompt Refinement
To enhance LLM performance:
- **Strengthen Dialect Handling**: Include examples of colloquial phrases in prompts or direct LLMs to use code_execution for linguistic analysis if needed.
- **Explicit Transliteration Rules**: Specify thresholds for "appropriate" ALA-LC use (e.g., always for names/terms, optional for phrases) to reduce revisions.
- **Symbol and Honorific Templates**: Provide templates for ﷺ usage (e.g., apply to all Prophet references) to minimize debate.
- **Segment Structure Tools**: Instruct LLMs to use tables for comparisons (e.g., struggles vs. clear areas) and code_execution for verifying incomplete segments.
- **Bias and Sensitivity Checks**: Reinforce "assume good intent" with examples to avoid over-caution in sensitive topics.
- **Hybrid Literal-Meaning Balance**: Prompt with "use literal unless context requires nuance, then explain reasoning" for figurative language.
