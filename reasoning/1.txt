Translating Arabic text with specific instructions
I need to translate the Arabic text provided, while following the user's instructions carefully. I’ll avoid any Arabic characters, except for ﷺ, and handle Qur'an citations properly by translating them into English, while keeping references like [التوبة:٣٧]. For Surah names, I'll stick to translating them (like "al-Tawbah"), as they aren’t narrators' names and should not be transliterated.

Handling surah names and translation choices
I’m sticking to transliteration only for narrator names, avoiding it for other terms like Surah names. It seems I should translate Surah names, like "Repentance" for al-Tawbah, while keeping references as "Qur'an 9:37" without including Arabic. I'll focus on keeping everything as clear and consistent as possible while following those instructions.

Transliterating only narrator names in chain
I need to transliterate the names of narrators in the isnad, such as "Musaddad", "Ismāʿīl", and so on, following ALA-LC rules. I'll also do this with biographical segments, as they still involve narrators. For scholars not part of the isnad, like "الشيخ محمد بن إبراهيم", I shouldn’t use transliteration with diacritics.

Translating non-narrator names and maintaining accuracy
For non-narrator names like "Shaykh Muḥammad ibn Ibrāhīm", I should avoid diacritics to stay consistent with the instructions, as diacritics are only for narrator names in the chain. I'll use plain transliteration or translation without diacritics. I also need to translate chapter headings properly and include citations to the file.

Translating hadith terms and citation details
I'll translate segments as per instructions: preserving punctuation and translating terms such as "thiqah" to "trustworthy" and "ṣadūq" to "truthful (of lesser precision)". I'll also translate narrator evaluations while staying true to the technical terminology. For citations, I can include them at the end in plain text, ensuring no Arabic characters appear. I’ll respect the formatting constraints.

Translating technical terms and named places carefully
For phrases like "أخرج له أصحاب الكتب الستة", I’ll translate directly as “narrated by the compilers of the six books.” For place names like "مزدلفة" (Muzdalifah) and "جمع" (Jamʿ), I’ll use explanations or transliterations when needed, while avoiding diacritics where possible. I'll ensure ALA-LC diacritics are used only for narrator names, as per instructions.

Translating proper nouns and names carefully
I think for proper nouns such as Arafah, Mina, and Muzdalifah, I'll use standard English forms without diacritics. However, for names in the narrator chain, I'll apply ALA-LC transliteration with diacritics. For terms like Dhu al-Qa'dah or other month names, I’ll avoid diacritics but ensure they're accurate without violating rules.

Translating Arabic phrases into English
I’ll translate phrases like "قال المصنف رحمه الله تعالى" as "The compiler, may Allah have mercy on him, said:", and keep "may Allah be pleased with him" for "رضي الله عنه". For chain narrations, I’ll use semicolons, and I’ll translate religious terms while respecting the instructions, such as "it becomes 'umrah and he exits iḥrām." I'll ensure clarity and accuracy.

Translating Islamic terms and phrases
I'll use common transliterations for certain terms like Hajj, 'umrah, ihram, tawaf al-ifadah, sa'y, and jamarat, without diacritics. For "God," I'll use Allah, except when the Arabic refers to "ilah." I'll also translate tribal names like "Mudar" and keep key phrases like "Indeed, time has returned..." with accurate punctuation.

Translating technical terms and context
In translation, I'll use common transliterations like "tawaf al-ifadah" without diacritics and explain the term "tafath" later as trimming nails and shaving hair. For specific terms like "الحبل," I'll include definitions with translations as needed. I'll balance between technical accuracy and maintaining clarity.

Handling translation consistency, diacritics, and formatting
I need to ensure translation consistency, using terms like "Chapter" for "باب" and "his Hajj" instead of "his Pilgrimage." I’ll avoid diacritics in certain terms, like 'umrah, but keep them in narrator names. I'll also preserve bracketed segments, maintain segment IDs, and include plain-text citations at the end. It'll align with both user and system requirements.

Ensuring translation clarity and consistency
I’ll maintain literal translation like "in his Hajj" and phrases such as "has rotated back" for "استدار." "Time has come full circle" works for "إن الزمان قد استدار..." and will integrate systematic translation. Regarding the prayer confusion story, the fatwa should reflect the need to repeat Thursday’s prayer both as Jumu’ah on Friday and as Zuhr. Finally, I’ll accurately translate “How is Hajj performed?” in the context of the hadith explanation.

Translating Arabic text with specialized terminology
I need to translate the Arabic text into English, keeping the specialized Islamic terminology as accurate as possible. I'll maintain the IDs at the beginning of each segment and ensure no Arabic characters except ﷺ. For the narrators' names, I'll use ALA-LC transliteration, but in the commentary, I can use English without diacritics, perhaps. This seems to be the preferred approach.

Handling transliteration for Islamic terms
The instruction is clear: transliterate narrator names in the isnād with diacritics per ALA-LC, without transliterating the textual content. For proper nouns outside the isnād like "al-ʿAḍbāʾ," I should translate by meaning instead of transliterating. For common names like Ibn Umar or Abu Dawud, I'll keep them in their Latin-form without diacritics.

Translating proper names in the matn
Since "al-ʿAḍbāʾ" is a proper name, I should avoid transliterating it within the matn, as the instruction forbids that. I’ll translate it as "his camel, al-ʿAḍbāʾ" to maintain clarity, using the plain form without diacritics but avoiding confusing translations like "Mutilated-Eared One." Keeping it simple seems like the best solution.

Clarifying transliteration and translation approach
Alright, I’ll keep proper names in simple romanization without diacritics, as the instruction only requires ALA-LC transliteration for narrator names in the isnād. For the chain, I’ll transliterate narrators with diacritics; for example, Hārūn b. ʿAbd Allāh. I'll translate phrases like "رضي الله عنه" as "may Allah be pleased with him" and maintain full quotations with appropriate formatting. I'll also translate headings and cite as needed.

Translating with format and technical terms considerations
For the translation, I'll keep the IDs, such as P6326, and include the filecite at the end, avoiding markdown. For technical terms like "thiqah," I'll use transliteration without diacritics according to the user's preference for plain-text. I'll translate narrators and heading texts while ensuring clarity and accuracy.

Transliteration approach for narrator names and technical terms
I'll avoid diacritics for non-narrator terms like "thiqah" or "saduq" and stick to plain romanization. For narrator names, I'll use transliteration with diacritics, like "Ibn Jābir" and "Abū Umāmah." Commentary can mention names without diacritics, but I’ll remain consistent with the instructions about following ALA-LC rules only for the chain.

Maintaining correct formatting for Arabic names and terms
I'll stick to ALA-LC transliteration for narrator names in the chain, using diacritics and special characters, like "ʿ" for ʿayn and "ḥ". Outside the chain, I'll use regular ASCII or minimal apostrophes, like "Abu Umamah Sudayy b. Ajlan". I'll also maintain parentheses in hadiths and translate terms clearly.

Translating hadith terms carefully
For "ḥaṣā al-khadhf," instead of using Arabic, I'll translate it as "sling pebbles." To clarify, I might explain it as "small stones, roughly like date pits." In the hadith, the meaning of "ظل" suggests "remained" or "stayed in the daytime," as in "he spent the night and stayed during the day."

Translating and maintaining clarity in fiqh terms
For technical terms like "fidyah" (ransom/expiation) and "mabit" (spending the night), I'll use the transliterations without diacritics for clarity. I'll also note "wājib" for "obligatory," but this won't follow ALA-LC exactly. I'll avoid Arabic terms in the translation unless it's necessary for the context.

Considering translation details and adherence to user instruction
For the translation, I'll ensure only plain-text is used and include filecite tokens at the end to comply with the citation requirement. I'll avoid Arabic characters and Arabic punctuation like commas and parentheses, using standard Western ones instead. I'll also make sure to use ALA-LC transliteration with diacritics for narrator names in the chain.

Considering how to handle transliteration for narrators
The instructions are clear: transliterate only narrators' names in the chain, using ALA-LC transliteration. Commentary and other sections outside the chain shouldn’t have transliterations. Narrators' names are in brackets or biographical info; they don’t count as part of the chain. So, I think I’ll keep those in plain English without transliteration.

Transliteration decision for biographical sections
The guidelines are strict about transliterating narrator names only in the chain, not in the biographical section. So, I'll use anglicized names for explanations outside the chain, avoiding diacritics. For chains, I'll use ALA-LC transliteration, ensuring correct macrons and other distinctions. I'll preserve the full isnad and be sure not to transliterate non-narrator elements like ﷺ.

Handling transliteration of extended chains and commentary
For the second to fifth chains, I'll apply ALA-LC transliteration to the names in the chain, like Muḥammad ibn al-ʿAlāʾ and Maʿmar. In commentary, I’ll stick with common English forms for non-chain names like Abu Dawud. For parts of the hadith text that include narrators within the matn, I’ll treat them as an extension of the chain and use transliteration.

Transliteration choices for names outside the chain
The instruction restricts transliteration to only the narrator names in the chain, so outside the chain, I’ll stick to using common English forms like Uthman and Abdullah ibn Masʿūd, without diacritics or ALA-LC transliteration. For Islamic terms, I’ll use terms like qasr and itmam to preserve accuracy and context.

Translating technical terms and maintaining clarity
I'll translate terms like "four-rakʿah prayer" but will stick to "rakʿah" rather than transliterating everything, as it's not a narrator name. Technical terms like "isnād" or "ḥadīth" can be transliterated using ALA-LC, as these aren't forbidden. I'll maintain clarity by avoiding excessive transliteration and ensure the chapter headings stay regular. The translation for headings should be specific, like "The manner of the prayer at Minā."

Translating hadith commentary and technical terms
For proper translation, I’ll say "then the ways diverged among you" for "ثم تفرقت بكم الطرق" and "I would have wished" for "فلوددت". "Four-rakʿah" can stay as is or be said "four-unit prayer." For terms, I’ll keep “Day of Tarwiyah” and “three Days of Tashrīq" with transliteration. As for biographies, I’ll avoid ALA-LC if not directly part of the chain.

Translating biographical section while addressing chain names
To maintain accuracy, I’ll avoid diacritics in biographical sections, following instructions to only use ALA-LC in the chain. Narrator names in brackets, like "[Musaddad narrated to us]," will still count as part of the chain and retain the transliteration. For names outside the chain, I’ll opt for plain English transliteration without diacritics.

Finalizing technical terms and diacritics usage
For the biography section, I’ll avoid diacritics unless necessary, following ALA-LC conventions. Common names like "al-Bukhari" will remain without diacritics. Technical terms like "ḥadīth" will include diacritics, as it's not a name. I'll use “Messenger of Allah ﷺ” for "رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم". I'll ensure correctness for terms like isnād and fiqh.

Deciding on transliteration and proper names
I’ll keep key terms like “رحمه الله تعالى” as "may Allah Most High have mercy on him" and "رضي الله عنه" as "may Allah be pleased with him." For the Prophet, I’ll use ﷺ. I will use diacritics where needed for names, like "Muḥammad" and also use transliterations without diacritics for names like “Abu Sa’id al-Khudri” and “Marwan ibn al-Hakam.”

Translating Arabic content with proper transliteration
The user wants Arabic segments translated from Sharh Sunan Abu Dawud with accurate transliteration. I’ll preserve narration chains in the original format, keeping ALA-LC transliteration for names only, like al-Qaʿnabī, ʿAbd Allāh, etc. I’ll decide on specific names, like Misʿar, and refine details, like "Wabrā".

Considering transliteration details for names and places
I’ll make sure to follow the transliteration guidelines precisely. For names of narrators like Kaddām, ʿAbd al-Malik, and others, I’ll stick to ALA-LC. For locations like Makkah and ʿArafah, I don’t need to use diacritics since they’re not narrators. Standard transliterations in English will work here, without Arabic letters.

Deciding on place transliterations and terms
For places like Arafah, Mina, and Muzdalifah, I'll use standard English spelling without diacritics, following the instruction to avoid diacritics outside of narrator names. While "Masjid al-Khayf" could be transliterated, I'll stick to common English transliterations. I'll also make sure to translate "Allah" as "Allah" and "ilāh" as "deity."

Translating hadith and verses correctly
I need to translate both hadith and Qur'anic verses. Hadith quotes with ﷺ should retain the abbreviation for blessings in translation. I'll keep the IDs exactly as they are, like "P6364", and avoid Arabic characters besides ﷺ. For the Qur'anic verse reference, I’ll translate into English and include the bracketed reference like [al-Baqarah: 196]. Terms like "عمرة الإسلام" will be translated as "the ʿumrah of Islam."

Translating technical terms with minimal diacritics
For consistency, I’ll opt for common transliterated terms like "ihram," "Umrah," and "tawaf" without diacritics to maintain accuracy and clarity. I won’t apply ALA-LC transliteration to these since they aren't narrators' names. Terms like "sa'i" will be written with an apostrophe to avoid distortion. For the narrator evaluations, I'll translate terms like "thiqah" as "trustworthy" and keep key phrases like "Aṣḥāb al-kutub al-sittah."

Translating terms and formatting guidelines
The four Abdullāhs among the Companions will be translated as Ibn ʿUmar, Ibn ʿAbbās, Ibn ʿAmr, and Ibn al-Zubayr. I'll include terms like "isnad" without altering them, but maintain plain text only, as instructed. Any hadith and Arabic quotes should be translated, such as "لتأخذوا مناسككم". I'll also use translations like "may Allah have mercy on him" and "may Allah be pleased with him" for certain quotes.

Translating chain and narrator names
The narrative in P6395 requires transliteration for narrators in the chain, like "al-Qaʿnabī" and "ʿAbd Allāh," with diacritics. For other references like "Abū Dāwūd" or "Ibn ʿUmar," I'll avoid diacritics unless they are within the chain. In P6396, I’ll follow the guideline strictly for narrator names within the chain.

Translating narrator names and technical terms
The interpretation seems clear: use ALA-LC transliteration for narrator names, like "ʿAbd Allāh ibn Maslamah al-Qaʿnabī" and "Aḥmad ibn Ḥanbal," with diacritics. For places or terms like "Jamrat al-ʿAqabah," we can use transliteration but avoid diacritics for non-narrator terms. Transliterate correctly where needed while adhering to the instructions.

Translating and formatting guideline
For clarity, I’ll use transliteration without diacritics for terms like "Jamrat al-Aqabah" and "Masjid al-Khayf." Any Arabic-Indic digits like [٢٢٩] will be converted to Latin digits, so it becomes [229]. I’ll ensure phrases like "Allah, Exalted is He, knows best" are translated and that there are no Arabic characters except where allowed.

Finalizing plain text translation and formatting
I'll use transliteration for terms like fidyah as "an expiation: a sheep" and for proper names like the "Islamic Development Bank" without abbreviations. For the rulings in P6364 and P6365, terms like "entered into ihram" and "Tawaf al-Qudum" will be translated with basic explanations in parentheses, avoiding macrons. I'll ensure all translations match the source exactly.

Translating hadith chains and supplications
For P6372, I'll translate the supplications: "There is no deity but Allah alone..." and "O Allah, none can withhold what You give..." For P6376b, I'll translate the hadith and quote translations. I'll use ALA-LC for narrators, like "ʿAbd Allāh—meaning Ibn ʿUmar al-ʿUmarī." I'll also address chain narratives, ensure no Arabic words remain, and maintain plain text formatting.

Translating hadith and fiqh terminology accurately
For P6399, I'll translate hadith segments and biographies as required, keeping parenthetical phrases in English. I'll adapt headings like "P6400" by maintaining the Arabic punctuation structure and clarifying translation choices. Additionally, for terms like "tamattuʿ," "qārīn," and "mufrid," I'll use their common meanings while keeping transliterations minimal as needed. I'll ensure punctuation follows English conventions and citations are placed properly at the text's end.

Translating and Transliterating Hadith and Fiqh Texts
Clarifying names and transliterations
For "Abd Allah ibn Muhammad," the text indicates "عبد الله بن محمد الزهري," but there's some confusion in the web sources suggesting "Abd Allah ibn Ja'far." The narrator could have a kunyah that causes this confusion. I'll retain the original text's transliteration, keeping it "ʿAbd Allāh ibn Muḥammad" as per the text, without corrections.

Clarifying transliterations and citation choices
The transliteration of "Wabra" will stay as it appears without vocalization. For Abdullah ibn Muhammad al-Zuhri, I'll stick with the text's version despite web sources suggesting a different name. As we are focused on translation, citations for the web aren't necessary unless I directly reference them, so I’ll omit them. Only the file citation will be included at the end.

Clarifying citation and source usage
I’ve decided that we don’t need web citations since we’re not referencing any facts derived from them—just the translation itself. The translation is language mapping, not factual claims. I’ll use the file citation at the end. Also, no Arabic letters or digits will appear in the output except for ﷺ.

Final translation approach and chain clarity
In this translation task, I need to avoid curly braces, and change phrases like "صحيح" and references such as [٢٢٩]. ID lines must stay at the start of each segment. Regarding the chain in P6395, I'll translate the narration carefully to clarify the weird chain: ‘Abd Allah ibn Umar the small narrates from Nafi from Ibn Umar, as described.

Translating narration chains and context
For the chains in P6397 and P6399, I’ll keep the structure as: “Aḥmad ibn Ḥanbal narrated to us…” and similarly for the others. For P6400, I’ll preserve "ʿAbd Allāh ibn Muḥammad al-Zuhrī narrated from Misʿar," etc. Additionally, I'll replace "صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم" with ﷺ, as instructed, and treat "عليه الصلاة والسلام" as referring to the Prophet ﷺ.

Finalizing translation choices
For consistency, when referring to the Prophet, I'll use ﷺ, even for "peace be upon him," to stay aligned with the user's request. For phrases like "عليه الصلاة والسلام," I’ll translate as "peace and blessings be upon him" but consider using

Translating narrator names and content consistency
I need to make sure I’m consistent with transliterating narrator names, especially in isnaad phrases. While the guidelines say to transliterate names in the chain only, it doesn’t prohibit transliterating names elsewhere. I’ll follow ALA-LC transliteration for clarity. I’ll also ensure non-chain content isn’t transliterated, and "الله" should be translated as "Allah," not as "God," unless it's referring to a generic deity.

Formatting and translation guidelines
When translating, "الله عز وجل" becomes "Allah, the Mighty and Majestic," and "أهل الشرك" could be "polytheists." I shouldn’t include Arabic characters except for ﷺ or diacritics, and Arabic-Indic digits need to be replaced with Western numerals. I’ll ensure translation aligns with numeric markers and adhere to the guideline of revising the text three times. Citations might be necessary too.

Handling citation requirements with user formatting requests
The system requires citations to include certain special characters, but the user wants plain text without markdown or formatting. This is tricky because the citation might include characters like parentheses, but I can include it at the end of the response in plain text. The content from the file must still be fully translated.

Maintaining text integrity while translating
I need to provide segments from P6436 to P6451, including P6439, which ends with "و" (meaning "and"). I'll translate the content as is, even if it's incomplete, to preserve the original meaning. I'll keep "And" at the end and continue translating each segment to maintain accuracy and flow.

Translating hadith terminology and chain
For "أخرج له أصحاب الكتب الستة," I'll go with "narrated from him the compilers of the Six Books," meaning Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Dawud, Tirmidhi, Nasa'i, and Ibn Majah. I'll use hadith terms like "thiqah" (trustworthy) and "ṣadūq" (truthful, may err). Also, I'll transliterate names and use English narration verbs for the chain.

Translating narration chains and scholar names
For narrators, I will use "may Allah be pleased with him/her" and transliterate names in the chain according to the ALA-LC system. For scholars like Al-Albani, since they aren't part of the chain, I'll keep their names in conventional forms without diacritics. I'll ensure that narrators' names have diacritics.

Interpreting transliteration requirements and translations
It seems the user wants transliteration restricted to narrators' names and Arabic terms like fiqh should stay untranslated. I'll follow ALA-LC for all names, ensuring diacritics are applied for accuracy. For scholars, like al-Albānī, I’ll keep conventional forms. As for the term "tamattuʿ" and "qirān," I’ll transliterate them as needed.

Translating technical terms instead of transliterating
To comply with the instructions, I’ll avoid transliterating Islamic technical terms like "tamattuʿ" and "qirān". As mentioned, transliteration is only for narrators. Though these terms can be transliterated for clarity, I’ll instead translate them into established English terms, like describing "tamattuʿ" as "the type of Hajj with a break between ʿumrah and Hajj".

Following instructions on transliteration and translation
I’ll strictly follow the instruction: only transliterate the names of narrators using ALA-LC. For other terms like ʿumrah, Hajj, and iḥrām, I’ll use commonly accepted transliterations with diacritics since they’re widely recognized. If a straightforward translation fits, I’ll translate, but I’ll lean toward keeping these technical terms in their transliterated form.

Deciding on diacritics and transliteration
I’m leaning toward using standard English terms like ʿumrah, Hajj, and iḥrām, while keeping diacritics because the user didn’t specify to avoid them. For other terms, like “wabar” (fur) and “dabar” (saddle sores), I’ll provide clear translations along with transliterations. For non-narrator terms, no Arabic digits or script will be used.

Translating hadith and biographies with care
I need to carefully follow the formatting while ensuring ʿumrah and ḥajj are not misrepresented, sticking to English terms with diacritics rather than Arabic. I’ll transliterate names with ALA-LC, like “Ibn Jurayj,” and translate the meaning where needed. I’ll maintain the original structure, including the IDs. The translated text will follow paragraph breaks, no markdown, but careful inclusion of explanations.

I need to translate Arabic segments, making sure to preserve the numeric prefixes and order (e.g., P6452). Only the narrator names should follow ALA-LC transliteration, like ʿAbd al-Aʿlā ibn Ḥammād. The textual content doesn't require transliteration, including names like ʿĀʾishah and Ibn ʿUmar.

Clarifying transliteration rules for names outside the chain
Outside the chain, I should stick to common English forms and avoid Arabic transliteration. For names like "Ibn ʿUmar," even if not part of the chain, it could still be transliterated, though the instruction says only narrators' names in the chain should follow ALA-LC. This means other references should be translated normally.

Deciding when to transliterate names
For names like "ʿĀʾishah" in matn content, I’ll only transliterate if they’re part of the chain, like in "عن عائشة". In commentary, I’ll use standard English for non-chain names like "al-Albani" without diacritics. The goal is to keep names consistent in translation while following the instruction for the chain.

Handling technical Islamic terms and transliteration
For terms like "ʿumrah," "ḥajj," and others, I should keep the transliteration in Latin letters, but only for narrator names in the chain. For terms in other contexts, such as "ʿUmrat al-Qaḍāʾ," I should translate as "the compensatory ʿumrah" to avoid confusion while respecting the instruction for English translations.

Translating technical terms while following guidelines
The guideline specifies ALA-LC transliteration only for narrators' names, not for technical Arabic terms. I should use terms like "ʿumrah" without diacritics or translate them using English equivalents, such as "minor pilgrimage" for "ʿumrah." This adheres to the restriction while maintaining the correct usage of key Islamic terms in English.

Translating with consistency and following guidelines
I’ll make sure to translate each segment carefully, preserving headings and IDs. Notable terms like "شرح حديث" will get a corresponding translation, and we’ll stick to the rule of using "Allah" instead of "God." For Arabic abbreviations, like "صلى الله عليه وسلم," we’ll use "ﷺ" and avoid any other Arabic characters. Square brackets can stay, but I’ll ensure only the right punctuation is added.

Translating and preserving narrative chains
I’ll preserve full chains of narration, like "ʿAbd al-Aʿlā ibn Ḥammād narrated to us," and translate “رضي الله عنها” as “may Allah be pleased with her” when it appears in the chain. Names like "Ibn ʿUmar" will remain transliterated in the narration, and I'll standardize terms like "Messenger of Allah" for consistency.

Transliteration and clarity for technical terms
For "Ibn ʿUmar" in the matn, I’ll leave it without diacritics to keep it consistent, as it’s not part of the chain. For terms like "عمرة القضية," I’ll translate it as "the compensatory ʿumrah (ʿumrah of fulfillment)" for clarity, while sticking to common spellings for months like Dhu al-Qa'dah.

Transliteration and translation of terms
I’ll stick with common transliterations, avoiding diacritics where possible. For terms like "الحديبية" (al-Hudaybiyyah) and "الميقات" (miqat), I’ll provide explanations when needed. For "منكر," I’ll translate it as "denounced" in a hadith criticism context. Overall, I’ll keep the terms familiar, like "qarin" and "Mothers of the Believers."

Handling transliterations in chain and commentary
For names in the chain, I'll use transliteration as it appears, such as "al-Nufaylī" instead of a full name. I'll follow the rule for only names in the chain, though biographies list full names. I’ll ensure consistency with phrases like "his hadith was recorded by" and terms like "thiqah."

Clarifying transliteration for narrators and scholars
I’ll stick to the rule of using ALA-LC transliteration for names of narrators in the chain, even in their biographies. For authors like al-Bukhari and scholars like al-Albani, I'll leave them without diacritics since they aren’t directly part of the chain, and use common spellings like "al-Bukhari".

Translating key terms and clarifying details
I'll translate "تطوف وتسعى" as "perform tawaf and sa'y". For "القارن", I'll keep the translation consistent throughout. It's important to translate "رفضت أعمالها" as "she abandoned its actions/rites," not as "rejected." I'll also ensure P6462 and P6464 are translated properly, keeping the correct phrase structures. I'll pay attention to the required formatting and citations at the end.

Resolving citation concerns and finalizing translation details
I’ll need to use the correct citation format with "turn4file0," but I’ll also add "website" as required. Since the user asked for plain text without markdown, I’ll include non-marked citations at the end. As for transliteration, I’ll follow ALA-LC standards, including specific details like "ʿAbd al-Aʿlā ibn Ḥammād."

Clarifying transliteration and name formatting
For transliteration, I'll use "ʿAbd al-Aʿlā" and not "al-Aʿlā" where ʿayn is needed. I'll keep "from his father" in the chain, even though the biography reveals full names. In the chain, I’ll use "Ibn ʿAbbās" instead of "ʿAbd Allāh ibn ʿAbbās" and apply diacritics where applicable: ʿAbd al-Aʿlā, ʿAmr ibn Dīnār, and others.

Clarifying transliteration and crafting translation
For transliteration, I'll ensure consistency with ALA-LC standards: "ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz ibn ʿAbd Allāh ibn Usayd" and "Muḥrish" are correct. I'll use "Abī" for "أبي" and "ibn Abī" for "بن أبي". I'll also maintain the correct diacritics for Arabic letters like "Ḥ" and "ḥ". In translation, I’ll ensure phrases like "أرضاها" are translated as "and be pleased with her".

I'll organize the segments with accurate headings and commentary.

Translating and organizing the umrah hadith
For the umrah of al-Hudaybiyyah, the Prophet was prevented from entering Makkah. The two distinct umrahs were those of al-Qadiyah and al-Ji'ranah. Some scholars discuss whether the umrah in Shawwal should be classified under Dhu al-Qa'dah.

I'll translate each bullet in the biography section, maintaining accuracy and clarity. Aishah’s descriptions and teachings will be noted, with the specific phrase "combined with the Farewell Hajj" used.

Clarifying the umrah specifics and detailed translations
The chain mentions four distinct umrahs performed by the Prophet ﷺ, including al-Hudaybiyyah, al-Qada, al-Ji'ranah, and the one combined with Hajj. Some names of narrators need careful transliteration (e.g. Hudbah to Hudāb). Key translations include explaining the Prophet’s actions, such as exiting ihram, and specific terminology like "تحلل" (coming out of ihram).

Clarifying the second umrah for A'ishah
A’ishah did not reject the umrah itself, but abandoned certain actions like tawaf due to menstruation. The Prophet ﷺ combined her umrah with Hajj, and later allowed her to perform a second umrah from Tan'im, making it a legitimate umrah, not a replacement. This situation showed that multiple umrahs in a year are permissible.

The user wants translation for the Arabic text from a specific file. I'll make sure to preserve the IDs at the beginning of each segment, and apply ALA-LC transliteration only for the narrator names in the isnad chain, not the explanatory text. For other references like "al-Bayhaqī," I’ll translate without transliterating.

Deciding on transliteration approach
It seems I should use ALA-LC transliteration with diacritics for the names of narrators in the isnad chain. For other Arabic names outside the chain, common English transliterations without diacritics (like al-Bayhaqi and al-Nawawi) should be fine. I'll make sure to follow these guidelines carefully while preserving clarity.

Handling chapter and digit translation
For the sanad, I need to preserve the full chain and bracketed chapters. I'll output plain text but keep the IDs as they are. Chapter headings should be translated, and I’ll use "Allah" and "ﷺ" for respect. Arabic digits should be converted to Western digits, while keeping categories and numeric prefixes as they are.

Translating while following plain-text and formatting guidelines
For the translation, I need to ensure I'm keeping the plain-text format, without markdown or other formatting. I'll preserve the chain and use transliterated names for the isnads, ensuring each segment aligns with the original IDs. Arabic digits and certain punctuation, like ‘–’, can be converted or left as needed. I'll translate chapter headings, too, like in the example provided.

Translating Arabic names with contextual rules
I need to be careful with how I translate names. For names in the chain, I’ll use ALA-LC transliteration with diacritics, like "ʿAbd al-Razzāq" and "ʿUbayd Allāh". For names outside the chain, like "Abū ʿAbd Allāh" or "Umm Salamah", I’ll use standard English transliterations without diacritics. If there's uncertainty, I’ll base decisions on context.

Translating names and technical terms
For narrator biographies, since they describe narrators of the chain, I'll apply ALA-LC transliteration to those names. Regarding technical terms like "Tawaf al-Ifadah", I’ll use standard transliterations without diacritics, since they aren’t names. Other phrases like "Allah, Exalted is He" will be translated respectfully.

Translating salutations and terms consistently
I’ll translate phrases like "رحمه الله تعالى" and "رضي الله عنه" as "may Allah have mercy on him" and "may Allah be pleased with him," respectively. For any salutation phrases like "صلى الله عليه وسلم", I’ll use "ﷺ" as instructed. For technical terms like "al-Manhar," I’ll avoid using ALA-LC transliteration.

Handling citation and formatting in plain text
The user asked for plain-text without markdown, so I have to be careful about how I add the citation since it involves special characters. The citation isn’t markdown though, so I’ll append it at the end, ensuring that it doesn’t include any Arabic characters except for ﷺ, as required. Each segment will begin with its ID, and I’ll craft the translation with that in mind.

Translating hadith and proper names
For translation, I should leave out any formatting and provide the plain text. For instance, phrases like "I ask You by the face of the Messenger ﷺ" are not permissible, and I'll mention that clearly. The names within the hadith chain will be transliterated in ALA-LC, such as Aḥmad ibn Ḥanbal, ʿAbd al-Razzāq, and ʿAbd Allāh ibn ʿUmar.

Translating names of narrators with consistency
I should render narrators' names with diacritics, like “ʿAbd Allāh ibn ʿUmar," but avoid adding diacritics to "ibn" itself. For terms like "ẓuhr," I could use "the Zuhr prayer" to avoid issues with technical transliteration. I'll stick to the ALA-LC standard for narrators’ names, while simplifying when necessary for clarity.

Handling transliteration and terminology in hadith commentary
For transliterating names, I’ll stick to ALA-LC standards with diacritics for narrators’ names, but avoid unnecessary diacritics for epithets like "al-Muṣaghghar". I’ll translate technical terms like "maqbul" as "acceptable" in parentheses to keep the meaning clear. For matn, simple transliterations like "Wahb ibn Zum'ah" are fine, and I’ll maintain consistency with “Umm Salamah” and other names.

The instruction says to use ALA-LC transliteration only on the names of narrators in the isnad chain, so I’ll follow that for names like "Qutaybah ibn Saʿīd". For other content, I’ll leave it in plain text. The biographical sections with the narrators' names should also be transliterated.

Deciding on transliteration of non-chain names
For names like ʿUmar, I think I’ll go with the standard English spelling, without diacritics. The instruction says to use ALA-LC transliteration only for narrators in the isnad chain, so I’ll avoid transliterating non-chain names, and "Umar" without diacritics should be fine here.

Handling surah names and diacritics
For surah names like "Āl ʿImrān," I think the instruction suggests using English versions with no Arabic characters, like "Al 'Imran." Since diacritics are allowed for narrators but not for non-chain names, I’ll avoid diacritics in non-narrator names, and translate the verse references without Arabic characters.

Handling religious terms and salutations
I need to use "Allah" instead of "God" in all instances, except when referring to "ilah." For phrases like "الله عز وجل" or "لله", I’ll follow the instruction to translate it as "Allah, Mighty and Majestic." For "صلى الله عليه وسلم," I’ll use ﷺ as the standard, as instructed, and apply it also in quotes like "عليه الصلاة والسلام."

Transliterating hadith names and technical terms
For hadith chain names, I'll use proper diacritics in the transliteration, like "Dāwūd ibn Rashīd" and "Muḥammad ibn Isḥāq." For compilers like "al-Tirmidi," I'll use anglicized forms without diacritics, like "al-Tirmidhi," as the instruction might limit diacritics. Place names like "al-Jiʿrānah" can be translated without diacritics as "al-Ji'ranah." For terms like "maqbūl," I'll translate as "acceptable (maqbūl)" with no diacritics.

Translating Islamic technical terms and hadith
For terms like "maqbūl," I'll use "acceptable (maqbūl)" to show its meaning. Since it might violate the no-Arabic rule, I'll stick to "maqbul" or "acceptable" without diacritics. Similarly, terms like "ثقة" will be translated as "trustworthy." For place names like "ʿUmrat al-Qaḍāʾ," I'll keep it simple with no diacritics.

Translating and maintaining consistency in hadith text
For terms like "Umrat al-Qada'," I'll use simple transliteration, and for “al-Rawdah” I’ll follow the same approach. Verses will be translated into English, keeping references but avoiding Arabic script. I’ll retain parentheses where needed, like in hadith. For terms like "expiation," I'll use proper English equivalents, ensuring consistency across transliteration and biographical sections with diacritics.

Translating and handling technical terms carefully
I need to avoid using Arabic script and consider that terms like "ʿ" and "ḥ" are Latin modifiers. References like verses should use Western numerals. For hadith, I'll avoid translating names and use phrases like "may Allah be pleased with them both." As for technical terms, like "ʿumrah" and "ihram," I should lean toward their conventional English forms unless instructed otherwise to keep in line with the diacritic rules.

Clarifying transliteration rules for hadith
I’ll use common English forms like "ihram", "tawaf", and "sa'i" without diacritics, since that’s standard for Islamic terms. For narrator names, I'll apply ALA-LC diacritics: "Qutaybah ibn Saʿīd" and "Saʿīd ibn Muzāḥim". I’ll also ensure accurate translations, such as "performed as many rak'ahs as Allah willed" instead of "bowed".

Clarifying hadith chain translation structure
I’m reviewing the narration chain. It appears Muhammad ibn Isḥāq narrated from both Abān ibn Ṣāliḥ and Ibn Abī Najīḥ, both of whom narrate from Mujāhid. The structure suggests two routes but doesn’t specify Abān from Mujāhid. I’ll preserve the given format and be careful with the narration sequence.

Translating rulings and narrations in context
I need to translate a complex list of rulings and narrations like Abu Dawud’s inclusion of certain reports, translating various fiqh terms and hadiths. Key points include discussions of Umrah duration, trimming hair during ihram, and interpretations around the Prophet ﷺ’s actions, with detailed translations and citations like "fidyah" for compensation in specific circumstances. Each term needs to be handled carefully, preserving meaning and context.



Ensuring readable translations with proper formatting
I'm focusing on properly translating Quran verses and hadiths. I'll translate verses in English without Arabic characters, except for specific letters like ﷺ. I need to preserve hadith chains with the correct transliteration, using diacritics like Muḥammad, ʿAbd Allāh, etc. I'll ensure consistency in formatting.

Translating honorifics and technical terms accurately
I’ll translate honorifics like "may Allah be pleased with them both" and "Mighty and Majestic" without using Arabic characters. For technical terms like "thiqah" (trustworthy), I'll keep the transliterations, but I’ll be mindful of using established translations like "trustworthy" or "truthful" where appropriate, especially for narrator evaluations.

Applying transliteration rules and translating technical terms
Based on the user's request, we should avoid transliterating technical terms and instead translate them into English. For instance, "thiqah" becomes "trustworthy," and "ṣadūq" becomes "truthful." We'll also keep references to hadith in English, avoid translating technical terms like "rubāʿiyyāt," and maintain parentheses where necessary. I'll include citations at the end while ensuring formatting remains clear.

Clarifying citation format and instructions
It seems the instructions for citations are a bit unclear. They want the citation to include (website) but also mention using turn0file0. I’ll follow that format, even if it's not the typical one with line numbers. I'll include (website) and ensure it's correct, maybe adding line numbers later if needed.

Translating with proper terminologies and consistency
I'll proceed with translating each segment while keeping IDs intact (e.g., P6424, P6424a). For terms like "قبر رسول الله," I'll use "the grave of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ" rather than "Prophet's grave," as instructed. Since "صلى الله عليه وسلم" should be translated as ﷺ, I'll use this consistently, even for "صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم."

Translating Quran references while following guidelines
For Quranic verses, I'll translate them into English but keep surah references like [al-Baqarah: 186]. The name "al-Baqarah" will stay as it is in transliteration, since it's a technical term, preserving the original format. Alternatively, "Quran 2:186" could work if I prefer a more literal style. I'll keep references in brackets as instructed.

Translating hadith with correct transliteration
The instructions specify using ALA-LC transliteration only for narrator names in the chain, not for textual content. So, for surah names like "[Quran 2:186]" and "[Quran 40:60]", we’ll use numbers instead of transliterating. For the hadith chain, we must transliterate narrator names and kunyah, like “al-Qaʿnabī” as “ʿAbd Allāh b. Maslamah.”

Translating narrator names and labels
For the narrators, we’ll transliterate as follows: "Qutaybah" for "قتيبة", "Yaʿqūb—meaning al-Iskandarānī" for "يعقوب -يعني: الإسكندراني", "Mūsā ibn ʿUqbah" for "موسى بن عقبة", "Muḥammad ibn al-ʿAlāʾ" for "محمد بن العلاء", etc. For "ʿAmr ibn ʿUthmān al-Maʿnā", we’ll explain the editorial label by saying, "ʿAmr ibn ʿUthmān, the one whose wording is intended."

Translating nuances in hadith and terminology
For "ʿAmr ibn ʿUthmān", we'll go with "the wording is his" or "with his wording". For the hadith, "do not take my grave as an ʿīd", we’ll translate it to "do not take my grave as a place of recurring visitation" since that fits the meaning well. We'll avoid unnecessary parentheses and stick to literal yet meaningful translation.

Translating technical Hajj terms carefully
For Hajj-related terms like "ḥalq" and "taqsir", I will translate them directly as "shaving" and "shortening". For terms like "tamattuʿ" and "qirān", since transliteration is prohibited except for narrator names, I’ll avoid transliteration and use descriptive English. For "بدنة", I’ll go with "camel" or "sacrificial camel" to maintain clarity.

Translating narrator names consistently
For terms like "budnah", I’ll use "camel". "نحر" will be translated as "slaughtered". For the groups like "السبعة المعروفين بكثرة الحديث", I can translate as "one of the seven Companions known for narrating many hadiths". Regarding the use of transliteration for names outside the chain, it seems safer to use plain English letters without diacritics in explanatory sections, while keeping diacritics in the chain.

Translating narrator names in and out of the chain
For the narrator names in the chain, I'll use ALA-LC transliteration with diacritics. Outside the chain, I'll avoid diacritics and use simple English approximations like "Abdullah ibn Maslamah." The user clearly wants transliteration only in the chain, so I'll respect that and stick with basic, readable transliterations for biographies.

Clarifying transliteration approach
For narrator names in chains, I'll use ALA-LC transliteration with diacritics. In biographies, I’ll use simpler forms without diacritics, like "Abdullah ibn Maslamah" instead of "ʿAbdullāh ibn Maslamah." This seems to align with the instructions while maintaining clarity. I'll also translate technical phrases, like "narrated by the authors of the six books, except Ibn Majah".

Translating key phrases and ensuring consistent format
I'll translate "الإسناد من أعلى الأسانيد عند أبي داود" as "This chain is among the highest for Abu Dawud, since it’s a four-narrator chain." For "عطف التلقين," I'll use "a conjunctive addition prompted by the questioners" for clarity. I'll also fix small text issues like "إنس أمسيت" to "I reached the evening." Text references will be in Western numerals, and I'll avoid Arabic characters and unnecessary braces.

Handling citation markup and transliteration details
Citations should be placed at the end, perhaps last paragraph or after translation. For transliteration, I'll use ALA-LC for names (e.g., "Muḥammad," "ʿAbd Allāh") and standard English spellings for locations like "Mina" or "Muzdalifah." I'll avoid complex transliteration for non-narrator content (e.g., "Jamrat al-Aqabah"). Translating "صلوا علي" as "send blessings upon me." Ensuring clarity in hadith and verses.

Translating and ensuring high accuracy for Hajj and Umrah rulings
The text outlines rulings on shaving and shortening for Hajj and Umrah, especially for men and women. It also covers a specific hadith on the Prophet's actions and includes translation for terms like “sixty-three camels.” Clarify chain of narrators and transliterations for accuracy, e.g., “Abu Talhah” without diacritics. Keep focus on meaning and context for clarity.

Translating and revising hadith explanations
The text discusses the explanation of certain hadiths, including specific actions during Hajj. I need to craft the translation carefully, ensuring no Arabic characters are present, converting Arabic digits to Latin. After translating, I'll review for alignment, accuracy, and transliteration. I'll ensure proper citations and verify the text before final submission.

Deciding on translation vs transliteration for terms
The request is clear: avoid transliterating Arabic into Latin, but perhaps it’s acceptable for established technical terms like "ṭawāf al-ifāḍah." I’ll translate phrases like "طواف الوداع" as "farewell circumambulation" and "طواف الإفاضة" as "circumambulation of ifāḍah" to keep translations accurate while respecting the technical terminology.

Deciding on translation for ifāḍah-related terms
The guideline is clear: use ALA-LC transliteration only for narrator names, and translate other terms. Terms like "farewell circumambulation" work, but for "ṭawāf al-ifāḍah," I’m debating between translating it as "the release circumambulation" or keeping "circumambulation of ifāḍah." I’ll aim for clarity while respecting the request to translate instead of transliterate.

Translating technical terms and blessings properly
To follow the instructions, I'll avoid transliterating terms like "ṭawāf al-ifāḍah" and instead translate them, maybe as "circumambulation of visitation" or "circumambulation on the Day of Sacrifice." For terms like "ramal," I'll use "brisk walking." Also, for blessings, I'll replace "صلى الله عليه وسلم" with ﷺ, as instructed.

Translating terms while maintaining accuracy
I'll translate "عليه الصلاة والسلام" as ﷺ, and interpret phrases like "رضي الله عنه" as "may Allah be pleased with him/her/them". Translating the chain segments like "تراجم رجال إسناد حديث" and keeping bracketed portions transliterated will maintain clarity. For technical terms, I'll use translations like "trustworthy" for "ثقة", and "truthful" for "صدوق".

Translating hadith chain and minimizing transliteration
For the hadith chain, I'll use ALA-LC transliteration for the narrator names: Naṣr ibn ʿAlī, Sufyān, Sulaymān al-Aḥwal, Ṭāwūs, and Ibn ʿAbbās. In explanation, I'll refer to "al-Muḥaṣṣab" as a proper noun, using "the place known as al-Muḥaṣṣab" in English to minimize unnecessary transliteration, while keeping the meaning clear.

Translating and adapting hadith and terms carefully
The instruction was clear—use no transliteration for textual content unless it's part of a proper name or place. For instance, I'll translate "سورة النور" as "Surat al-Nur" without diacritics, not "Sūrat al-Nūr." For the hadith, terms like "circumambulation" and "Day of Sacrifice" will be used. Other details like narration and brackets should be kept intact.

Translating terms carefully for clarity
For "أصحاب الكتب الستة," I’ll use the phrase "the authors of the six books." "أبو الزبير" should be "Abū al-Zubayr," with diacritics. I’ll keep "ʿĀʾishah" and "ʿAbd Allāh" in ALA-LC format. "الصديقة بنت الصديق" can be translated as “the truthful one, daughter of the truthful one.” For hadith text, I’ll stick to clear translations without Arabic letters.

Translating key Hajj and Umrah terms
For terms like “ifāḍah” and “umrah,” I’ll leave them as they are, without transliteration or diacritics, since they're widely used in English. I’ll opt for “the seven circuits of the circumambulation of ifāḍah,” as it feels clearer. For "ramal," I'll translate as "brisk walking," without using transliteration.

Translating and clarifying circumambulation rulings
For "الرمل," I'll translate it as "brisk walk, a light quickening of pace with short steps." The Prophet performed this in his umrah and arrival tawaf at Hajj, riding a camel. I'll clarify that Ibn Abbas notes the brisk walk applies only in the first tawaf, whether for Hajj or umrah. For "سحراً," I'll translate as "in the pre-dawn hours." Regarding the farewell tawaf, I'll translate that it is obligatory, but a concession is granted to menstruating women.

Translating and formatting hadith names and rulings
For transliterations, I'll use ALA-LC for narrator names like "ʿĀʾishah" and "Ṣafiyyah bint Huyayy", but for non-narrators, I'll skip it. I'll be careful translating terms like "التيمم" (dry ablution) without transliterating but ensuring accuracy. I'll use diacritics like ḥ and ʿ, but avoid Arabic punctuation and keep consistent transliterations in the hadith chains.

Clarifying translation instructions for hadith
I need to translate the text while preserving IDs and keeping the hadith terminology like isnād, matn, and thiqah. The narrators' names in the isnād should be transliterated, but not the textual content or other names. I'll also remove brackets and avoid including Arabic characters except for ﷺ. When discussing narrators outside the chain, I'll follow the guideline for transliteration.

Clarifying transliteration rules for narrators and terms
I think Aisha should be transliterated as ʿĀʾishah when referencing her as a narrator, even if she's not part of the chain. The rule specifies transliteration for narrators in the chain, but it might be safer to apply it universally for any narrators. For place names, I can use standard English transliterations like Makkah and Minā without diacritics, as they aren't restricted.

Deciding on transliteration for places and terminology
For place names, I'll use common English forms like Makkah and Mina, though I’ll avoid diacritics for places like Arafah and ʿArafah, as the instruction specifically recommends diacritics only for narrators in the isnād. I'll follow the guideline to translate "God" as Allah and maintain proper hadith terminology.

Handling chain markers and preserving meaning
For the chain marker "ح", I'll translate it as "with the same meaning" without using Arabic characters. I’ll keep the structure by including the names of narrators and the corresponding citations in transliteration, without displaying the ḥ. For phrases like "قال المصنف رحمه الله تعالى," I’ll translate it as "The compiler, may Allah have mercy on him, said." This ensures clarity while respecting instructions.

Translating specific terms and formatting rules
For the headings, I’ll keep the ID and hyphen format as instructed, translating segments like "[باب: التحصيب. حدثنا...]" as needed. I’ll translate "رضي الله عنها" as "may Allah be pleased with her" and "عليه الصلاة والسلام" as " ﷺ" for consistency, per instructions. When it comes to narrative content like hajj events, I’ll ensure accurate translations while avoiding transliterating prayers.

Handling fiqh terms and translations
The instruction about transliteration applies to narrators, so for terms like ẓuhr or ʿAdl, it would be safer to use common English equivalents like "noon prayer" or "al-Adl". For biographical sections, translating "thiqah" as "trustworthy" works, but I might add the Arabic term in parentheses for accuracy. Similarly, for terms like "Tābiʿīn", I will choose a format that's clear while avoiding unnecessary diacritics.

Providing translations and transliterations
I'll use "Successors" instead of "Tābi'in" for clarity. For "مولى رسول الله," I’ll translate as "freedman." When it comes to transliterations, I’ll follow ALA-LC guidelines for names like "ʿAmr" and "ʿUthmān." For place names, I'll lean towards common transliterations only if strictly necessary, avoiding diacritics for consistency with instructions.

Finalizing translation guidelines
I'll follow the strict guidelines by using simplified transliteration for non-narrator names (like al-Muhassab, al-Abtah) without diacritics, and use ALA-LC for narrators in the chain. For non-narrators like Banu Hashim, I’ll avoid diacritics. Punctuation will be English-only, and I'll ensure bracketed hadith excerpts are translated.

Clarifying transliteration rules for Arabic text
It seems I need to use ALA-LC transliteration only for names of narrators mentioned in the chain, not for the rest of the text. So for things like "حدثنا القعنبي عن مالك," I’ll transliterate the narrators, but other names like Abu Dawud al-Sijistani should stay in standard English form without diacritics.

Handling citations and transliteration in translation
I’ll avoid using Arabic letters except for ﷺ. For names like Abu Dawud al-Sijistani, I'll use common romanization without diacritics. I can translate Quran verses, and keep chapter headings with IDs. Citations are required though, even if they include special characters — I'll include those carefully, since the user prefers plain-text.

Balancing citation requirements with plain-text request
The citation needs to be inline, as per instructions, but the user strictly wants plain text with no formatting. I’ll try adding the citation at the end of the sentence, in plain text, though it might include symbols that don’t match the translation. I’ll make sure it doesn't disrupt the content too much.

Addressing file search and snippet concerns
It seems the file search output from the message only includes the result from turn0file0, but I need to identify the snippet with a pointer. A pointer like "turn:chunk" isn't showing up. I’ll perform a search with a source filter to get the snippet along with line numbers, even if the file is already loaded.

Retrieving remaining file segments for translation
I need the rest of the file segments from P6428 onward for citations and translation. I’ll use the mclick function to open the remaining parts, like chunk 1:2 and possibly more. Let’s continue with mclick for 1:2 and proceed from there.

Translating and preserving narration details
I now have the full text with line numbers L2-L98 — great! For the translation, I need to accurately preserve IDs and chains of narration. For example, "القعنبي" is transliterated as al-Qaʿnabī, and full names like ʿAbd Allāh ibn Maslamah should also follow the same format. I’ll handle the "حدثنا" as "narrated to us" and ensure consistency across all the names and narration chains.

Clarifying translation of "al-Maʿnā" in isnad
I’m grappling with the term "الْمَعْنَى" here—does it mean "the one whose wording is paraphrased"? In the context of hadith, "والمعنى" often means “the meaning (is that…)". This isnad mentions "عمرو بن عثمان المعنى," which could refer to the narrator whose version is understood, not word-for-word. I’ll aim to translate it as “ʿAmr ibn ʿUthmān; (the wording is by meaning)."

Clarifying transliteration rules for narrators
In the Arabic text, "المعنى" refers to paraphrasing, not part of a narrator's name. So, I should translate it as "(with the meaning)" rather than as a name. For other parts of the chain, like "يعقوب," I’ll transliterate "al-Iskandarānī" and others with appropriate diacritics, such as "Qutaybah" and "Yaʿqūb" as required.

Clarifying transliteration for chains and companions
For names in the chain like Hafṣ, Hishām, Ibn Sīrīn, Anas ibn Mālik, I’ll stick to transliterating only the narrators. For others, like companions mentioned in explanatory text (e.g., Abu Bakr), I’ll use standard spellings without diacritics, since they're not part of the actual chain of narrators.

Clarifying transliteration for technical terms and names
For names like Abu Bakr, I'll use the common English spelling without diacritics unless they're in the chain of narrators. For terms like tawassul, I'll avoid using transliterations and will go with literal meanings, like "seeking a means of approach." I'll stick to translating based on context, per the instructions.

Translating terms for clarity and consistency
For terms like "thiqah," I'll translate as "trustworthy" or "reliable," and "ṣadūq" as "truthful" or "honest." I'll avoid transliterating "isnād" and will use "chain of narration" without diacritics. For place names like "Jamrat al-ʿAqabah," I'll stick with common English spellings without diacritics. "God" will be translated as "Allah."

Maintaining clarity with translations and references
I’ll translate "آله" as "and his family," and ensure Arabic parentheses and square brackets are handled correctly. The ID segments (e.g., P6424, P6424a) will be maintained. I'll avoid Arabic characters, except for ﷺ, and provide English translations for Quranic verses and surah references like [al-Baqarah: 186] without diacritics. For "عيداً," I'll translate it as "an Eid" to preserve the meaning while avoiding Arabic script. Hadith quotes will be maintained in parentheses.

Handling typos and translation prompts
I’ll translate “عطف التلقين” as "prompted conjunction" and explain it. For typos, like "اللهم ارحم الملحقين," I'll translate as "those who shave," even if the text is incorrect. For "إنس أمسيت ولم أرم," I’ll translate it as "I entered evening without stoning" based on meaning. The textual errors will still be reflected in the translation when necessary while following instructions on handling numeric prefixes and fiqh context.

Transliteration guide for narrators' names
For narrators like "Abū Nuʿaym," and "al-Ḥalabī," I'll use ALA-LC transliteration. I’ll apply this rule consistently for names found in the isnād, like “Sufyān ibn ʿUyaynah,” “Ḥafṣ ibn Ghiyāth,” etc. Even in biography sections, I believe all narrators' names should be transliterated, as they still reference the chain.

Applying ALA-LC transliteration rules
It seems that the transliteration rules should apply strictly to names of narrators within the isnad. Though the biography section refers to narrators, I’ll follow the strict interpretation and transliterate only those in the chain. For non-narrator names like “Ibn Majah” or “al-Nasa'i,” I’ll leave them without diacritics and ensure no Arabic numerals. I'll also translate the author's comments like "the compiler said.”

Deciding on terminology for translation
When translating, I’ll use “the compiler” or “the author” for terms like "قال المصنف," keeping an accurate context. For terms like "Hajj" and "ʿUmrah," I will avoid diacritics but use common English terms. Additionally, Arabic place names and technical terms will be adapted to be clearer, with no Arabic script except ﷺ. I'll also ensure the isnad is properly translated, and avoid introducing unnecessary details in the biography section when possible.

Clarifying transliteration and citation guidelines
I’ll transliterate names of narrators in the chain using ALA-LC with diacritics, but for everyone else, like Abu Talhah, I’ll keep the common spelling without diacritics. Citations will be included at the end of the line, using the latest marker and the required range. For the biography section, I’ll follow the same guideline for narrators.

Crafting translations and maintaining accuracy
I'm carefully translating all segments with attention to clarity. I'll avoid unnecessary transliterations, especially for terms like "qiran" and "tamattuʿ", but include clear English descriptors. For instance, I'll explain pilgrimage terms explicitly instead of using transliterated Arabic terms. I'll proceed with creating precise, clear translations while following citation guidelines and maintaining consistent use of diacritics for narrators' names.

I need to translate segments P6517-P6524 while keeping IDs intact and using ALA-LC transliteration only for narrator names within isnad chains. For example, in the chain "حدثنا القعنبي عن مالك ..." I’ll transliterate the names like al-Qaʿnabī, Mālik, and the others. However, biography segments may not need this transliteration unless applicable within the context of isnad chains.

Deciding on transliteration usage for biographies
I’m thinking that since these are narrator names, I should probably transliterate them throughout, even in the biography section, to follow the rule for consistency. However, it seems the main guidance is to apply this only within the isnad chain. For non-chain names like "Muʿāwiyah," I’ll avoid transliteration unless explicitly part of a chain.

Transliteration guidelines and phrase translation
Muʿāwiyah is definitely a narrator, but since his name isn't part of the isnad chain here, I'll stick to writing it without diacritics, like "Muawiyah." For phrases like "رحمه الله تعالى," I'll translate as "may Allah have mercy on him" and so on. Diacritics on terms like "ﷺ" are okay when used for specific religious phrases, as instructed.

Rendering salutations for consistency
When it comes to the phrase "عليه الصلاة والسلام," I think it's best to render it as "ﷺ" for all variations of salutations to the Prophet, like "صلى الله عليه وعلى آله وسلم," for consistency. Even though instructions specify only "صلى الله عليه وسلم," it's clearer to handle all instances the same way.

The headings in segments P6517 and P6518 will be translated as specified.

Translating and rendering Arabic terms and names
For "قال المصنف," I'll use "The compiler said" to keep consistency with scholarly language. For hadith terms, I'll translate "وقف رسول الله" as "The Messenger of Allah ﷺ stood" and similarly for other specific terms like "stoned the Jamrah" for "ramy". Narrator names will be transliterated as "al-Qaʿnabī," "Mālik," and "Ibn Shihāb" as appropriate.

Translating and rendering terms in hadith
For "one of the four 'Abdallahs' among the Companions," I'll keep it clear and maintain consistency. Translating hadith terms, such as "saʿy before ṭawāf" is tricky – I'll use simple terms like "those performing tamattuʿ" while keeping technical terms like "mutamattiʿ" in transliteration, avoiding Arabic characters. The specific narration chain and context will stay as accurate and readable as possible for clarity.

Translating fiqh terms without diacritics
While the instructions suggest using ALA-LC diacritics only for narrator names, it's unclear whether this applies to technical terms like "tamattuʿ" or "ʿUmrah." To stay safe, I'll use English equivalents like "the one performing tamattuʿ" or "Hajj al-tamattuʿ," avoiding diacritics for these terms, especially for clarity and consistency.

Translating technical terms and diacritics
Since the user prefers no Arabic characters, I'll use apostrophes for the ʿ sound (e.g., "tamattu'", "qiran", "ifrad"). For terms like "iqtaraḍa ʿirḍ", I'll explain them simply, as harming one's honor. I'll also keep technical terms like "jarh al-ruwat" and "ta'dil al-shuhud" with direct translations such as "criticizing narrators" or "accrediting witnesses".

Translating hadith and biography details
I’ll stick with “Ibn Jurayj” without diacritics for consistency with instructions. For the hadith, I’ll clarify that the story speaks of a prayer with no sutrah between the Prophet ﷺ and the people passing by. Regarding the biography, I’ll translate terms like "maqbul" as “acceptable” and "Kutub al-Sittah" as "the authors of the six books."

I need to translate segments P6497-6516 accurately, focusing on plain text. I’ll ensure no Arabic characters (except ﷺ) and use ALA-LC transliteration for narrators’ names. Only in isnad chains, not commentary like "يقول الخطابي". I'll stick to exact transliteration rules for names and ensure clarity across the translation.

Transliteration decisions for names
The instruction says to use ALA-LC transliteration only for narrators’ names in the chain. For commentary, it seems I can leave common names like "al-Khaṭṭābī" in English without diacritics to avoid breaking the rule. So I’ll use “al-Khattabi” to maintain clarity, though it’s less accurate.

Transliteration for non-narrator names
The instruction says to use ALA-LC only for narrator names in the isnad chain, but for others, it seems like standard English transliterations without diacritics are fine. For terms like "al-Tahawi" or "Ibn Hibban," I’ll keep those common forms. For technical terms, I’ll avoid Arabic characters but use transliteration like "ṭawāf."

Translating technical terms without transliteration
The instruction is clear: transliteration is only for names, so I should avoid using it for terms like "ṭawāf al-wadāʿ." Instead, I’ll use the English translation “farewell circumambulation.” Similarly, for other terms like "يوم النحر" or "الحائض," I’ll just translate them directly (e.g., "Day of Sacrifice" and "menstruating woman").

Maintaining translation consistency and clarity
I need to preserve chapter headings exactly as they are, like "P6497 - Explanation of the hadith." For non-narrator names in the matn (e.g., ʿUmar), I'll need to be careful. The instruction clearly states to transliterate only narrator names, so for ʿUmar, I’ll leave it in English as “Umar,” to ensure accuracy.

Clarifying transliteration for matn and isnad
It seems that when the name of a narrator appears within the matn (like "al-Ḥārith said"), it still relates to the isnad, so I should likely keep ALA-LC for consistency. For non-narrators like ʿUmar ibn al-Khattab, I'll use common transliteration without diacritics.

Maintaining consistency in translation and transliteration
For the hadith text, I’ll keep "Umar" and "Messenger of Allah ﷺ" without diacritics, since they’re not part of the isnad chain. I'll also retain square brackets around chain references. For titles and terms like "Juz' al-Qira'ah" or "Khalq Af'al al-'Ibad," I can keep the transliteration without diacritics. "Maqbul" will be translated as "acceptable."

Clarifying transliteration choices
I must use ALA-LC transliteration for names in the chain (like Wahb b. Baqiyyah, Khālid, ʿĀʾishah), but not for the textual content. The rule about applying ALA-LC strictly to the chain suggests that biographies don’t need it, even though they refer to the same narrators. I’ll stick to standard transliteration in biographies for consistency.

Clarifying ALA-LC transliteration application
It seems I should apply ALA-LC transliteration only to narrator names in the chain section – not the textual content or biographies. While biographies mention narrators, they aren't strictly part of the isnad (chain) and don't need transliteration. To be safe, though, I'll use ALA-LC primarily in isnad sections.

Clarifying the ALA-LC Transliteration Approach
I'll stick to ALA-LC transliteration for narrator names in the isnad chain sections, like within "[Narrated to us…]". For biographies, I’ll use standard transliteration without diacritics, since they’re not part of the chain. I’ll also make sure punctuation and parentheses are preserved as instructed.

Translating technical terms and ensuring consistency
For place names like "al-Muhassab," I'll use transliteration without diacritics, like "Mina," "al-Abtah," and "al-Tan'im," reflecting local custom. I'll also consider technical terms such as "umrah," "ihram," and "tawaf" without diacritics unless explicitly required. I'll handle hadith and Islamic terms carefully, mindful of the need for consistency.

Translating narrators' names and hadith explanations
I'll transliterate narrator names using ALA-LC, even outside the chain, since it's part of the isnaad phrase. For biographical sections, I'll apply this consistently for narrator names, but avoid ALA-LC for fiqh terms. I'll use common transliteration for scholars, ensuring clarity and consistency across the translation.

The user wants a translation, but I need to follow specific rules. Only the names of narrators in chains should be transliterated using ALA-LC, not the content of the hadith. "Ibn Abbas" should be transliterated because he's a narrator, but it's unclear if he's considered part of the chain here. I'll stick to the rule for chains.

Translating and transliterating narrator names in hadith
The user wants me to preserve full chains of narration and use ALA-LC transliteration only for narrator names in the chain. Since Ibn Abbas is a narrator, I should transliterate his name. Non-narrator names, like "al-Badawī," don’t need transliteration, but I can still translate or anglicize them. I’ll follow the rule strictly for narrators.

Translating names outside narration chains
The user’s instructions are clear: ALA-LC transliteration applies only to narrators in a chain, not to other text. For non-narrators, like "al-Badawī," I could either use the established English form "al-Badawi" (no diacritics) or keep the transliteration with diacritics. I’ll go with "al-Badawi" since it's simplified and common.

Handling transliterations for names and verses
For non-narrators' proper names, I'll use common English spellings without diacritics to avoid ALA-LC transliteration. For narrators like "Ibn Abbas" or "Ibrahim," I'll use the common forms, not transliterating with diacritics. As for Qur'anic verses, I'll eliminate Arabic characters and provide translations, keeping Arabic numerals for references like "al-Naml: 62."

Translating Qur'anic terms and technical vocabulary
To stay in line with the user’s instructions, I'll avoid using Arabic letters, and use common transliterations like "al-Naml" for surahs. For technical terms, I'll keep them in transliteration—like "muhrim," "khuff," and "tamattu'”—to preserve accuracy but avoid format confusion. I'll also include the meaning where necessary, like "the muhrim (in ihram)." For place names, I'll use standard transliterations like "ʿArafah."

Adjusting translation style and consistency
For phrases like "صلى الله عليه وسلم," I’ll replace it with ﷺ as specified. The same applies to "عليه الصلاة والسلام.” I'll remove Arabic characters from headings and phrases, translating them appropriately, such as "الأسئلة" becoming "Questions." Lastly, I’ll carefully review the translation three times to ensure accuracy and consistency.

Clarifying rulings on khuffs and visiting graves
Regarding khuffs covering the ankles, if needed, they shouldn’t be cut, as the Prophet ﷺ's actions on the Day of ʿArafah didn't mention cutting. If worn below the ankle, khuffs can be treated like sandals. When visiting graves, one should ask Allah for the deceased, not from them, as found in relevant hadith and Quranic teachings.

Clarifying supplication and Hajj rules
The Prophet ﷺ emphasized that supplication is worship; when visiting graves, we should ask Allah for the deceased, not the occupant. Regarding the Prophet ﷺ, we greet him and ask Allah for intercession, not directly of him. As for Hajj: leaving tawaf al-wada' requires fidya, and a woman’s Hajj isn't completed without tawaf al-ifadah, even if delayed.

Clarifying tawaf rulings and supplications
Tawaf al-ifadah is valid on the 14th of Dhu al-Hijjah and beyond, though it's better to do it earlier. If done before travel, it counts for the farewell tawaf. Regarding a child in tawaf, both the carrier and the child count if they both intend to make tawaf. An illiterate person can substitute personal supplications for specific verses they don't understand.

Clarifying rulings on personal acts and funeral preparations
It’s good to teach someone du’as and supplications, encouraging them to recite whatever they’ve memorized from the Quran. As for shaving or shortening while in ihram, doing it oneself doesn’t contradict the Sunnah, though having someone else do it is fine too. Regarding funeral matters, only men prepare a man’s body and only women prepare a woman’s, with exceptions for spouses.

Ruling on Hajj, debts, and tamattu' handling
Men have an obligation to perform funeral prayers, while women are not required for congregational prayers. Regarding Hajj, if someone has debts, it’s recommended they seek permission before performing Hajj, and it’s better to reduce their debt first. If traveling to Jeddah, one can enter ihram from there if they didn’t know they'd perform Hajj from Madinah initially. For performing Hajj on behalf of someone else, one must be sincere, and their motive shouldn’t be financial gain.

I need to translate the Arabic text into English, preserving symbols like ﷺ. The rule says to transliterate narrators' names in the chain using ALA-LC, but not for names in the commentary. I'll ensure I follow the ALA-LC method strictly within the isnad and avoid applying it to other parts.

Translating Arabic terms and names
We must transliterate narrator names in the chain, and I'll keep that consistent in both the isnad and biographical references. Arabic technical terms like "thiqah" and "ṣadūq" will remain as transliterations, while their meanings will be properly conveyed in English, like "reliable" or "truthful." Other Arabic words won't be transliterated unless part of the chain.

Translating technical terms and names
For terms like "thiqa," we'll translate it as "trustworthy" instead of using transliteration, since the rule only applies to narrator names in the chain. "Ṣaḥīḥayn" isn't part of the narrator's name, so it's better to translate it as "the two Ṣaḥīḥs (al-Bukhārī and Muslim)" rather than transliterate.

Translating Arabic names and terms
I’ll avoid transliterating non-narrator names to comply with the instructions. For “the two Ṣaḥīḥ collections,” I'll use “the two authentic collections (al-Bukhārī and Muslim)” in English. Since al-Bukhārī and Muslim are authors, I’ll stick to common forms without diacritics, but for narrators like Ibn ʿAbbās, I’ll use ALA-LC transliteration.

Translating specific phrases and maintaining consistency
We’ll translate "Allah" for God unless referring to an ilah. For phrases like "صلى الله عليه وسلم" I'll use "ﷺ" as instructed, but for "عليه الصلاة والسلام," "ﷺ" might be fine for consistency. We’ll ensure all segment IDs are preserved and refrain from uppercasing. For the bracketed narration markers, I’ll keep them in the translation to preserve alignment. Scholars’ names can be rendered with common spellings without diacritics.

Translating and maintaining ALA-LC standards for chains
For the hadith chains, we ensure to transliterate names using ALA-LC standards, such as "Aḥmad ibn Ḥanbal" and "ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ibn Mahdī." For nisbahs like "al-Dimashqī," we'll follow the proper formatting, including the correct macrons and diacritics. We’ll include "may Allah be pleased with him" for phrases like 'رضي الله عنه' and translate 'أخرج له أصحاب الكتب الستة' as "his hadith was recorded by the compilers of the Six Books."

Handling transliteration for non-chain names and hadith terminology
For terms like "Six Books" (Kutub al-Sittah), we’ll use translation without listing all authors. For "أحد أصحاب المذاهب الأربعة", I’ll translate it as "one of the founders of the four well-known schools of jurisprudence." As for non-chain names like Abu Shah and Abu Dawud, we’ll avoid diacritics, as they’re not part of the chain.

Deciding on ALA-LC for narrators and related names
The segment describes a route from Muhammad ibn Musaffa to al-Walid. Since they are narrators, my best bet is to apply ALA-LC with diacritics for those names in the chain. For non-chain names like Abu Dawud or scholars like al-Albani, I’ll avoid diacritics. Consistency will follow instructions.

Deciding on transliterations and translation choices
For names like "Muḥammad ibn Muṣaffā," we'll use ALA-LC without "al-" because it's referring to his father's name. For others in the chain like "Ibn Majah," we'll transliterate without diacritics as he is a compiler, not a direct narrator. For "al-Nasa'i," I'll use the common form, avoiding Arabic letters except for ﷺ. I'll stay faithful to literal translations, like for "Tarājim rijāl isnād ḥadīth."

Translating and clarifying narration details
For the hadith of Abu Hurayrah, I'll clarify that he's ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ibn Ṣakhr, a Companion of the Prophet ﷺ, highly prolific in hadith narration. I’ll include the translation of the phrase "رضي الله عنه وأرضاه," acknowledging his revered status. For Abu Shah's story, I’ll avoid transliteration, using "the two Sahihs" and simplifying the narrative of the hadith. I'll also make sure parentheses and brackets are maintained.

Clarifying hadith translations and biographies
For the hadith, I’ll translate the phrase "ولا يختلى خلاها" as "and its fresh herbage is not to be cut" and provide context about Mecca’s sanctity. When discussing the biographies, I'll keep translations accurate, using "narrated to us" consistently. For names, I'll follow ALA-LC standards, like "Musaykah al-Malikiyyah." I'll also clarify terms like "ilhad" as "deviation from what is right" based on the context.

Clarifying hadith, biographies, and translation details
I’ll make sure to translate the key phrases accurately, like "Monopolizing food in the Haram is ilhad therein" and mention Mecca's sanctity. I'll keep the format with IDs intact, such as "P6548 - Biographies of the men of the chain." For transliterations, I’ll be consistent with diacritics, ensuring no stray Arabic characters appear. I'll maintain respectful phrasing, like "may Allah the Exalted have mercy upon him."

Clarifying hadith chains and meanings
The hadith mentions the prohibition of harming Mecca’s vegetation, including both big and small plants. Following that, I’m reviewing the narrators involved and making sure the proper transliterations and context are used. For instance, the term "the four 'Abd Allāhs" refers to key companions with that name. I'll adjust phrasing to clarify these points for the best understanding.

Clarifying hadith contents and chain of narrators
The hadith emphasizes the prohibition of building in Mina and also explains that monopolizing food in the Haram is wrong. I’m ensuring correct transliterations for names like "ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ibn Mahdī" and "Jaʿfar ibn Yaḥyā," and confirming the correct phrasing for the hadiths, like addressing issues of monopolizing food.

I need to translate Arabic passages from Sharh Sunan Abu Dawud but preserve the IDs and plain text. For narrators' names in the chain, I should use ALA-LC transliteration. Outside the chain, I can use regular names in English, though transliterating when identifying narrators seems better for consistency.

Clarifying transliteration rules
It seems like the user wants ALA-LC transliteration for the narrators’ names inside the chain, but not for the explanatory text. For names like "النسائي", which are scholars and not in the chain, I can use "al-Nasa'i" in English. The rule seems to apply specifically to the chain segments.

Transliteration rules for names in the text
I should transliterate only the narrators' names in the chain using ALA-LC, not the names in the actual hadith text (matn). For matn, I’ll likely use common English forms like "Ibn Abbas" or "Usamah ibn Zayd." The rule seems to suggest no diacritics or strict ALA-LC in the text itself.

Clarifying the transliteration and translation approach
For narrators' names in chains, I’ll use ALA-LC with diacritics, like "Ḥasan b. ʿAlī," but for names in matn, I’ll use standard non-diacritic forms, like "Ibn Abbas." I’ll also maintain clear translations for technical terms and headings while being careful about punctuation, and ensuring accurate terms.

Translating hadith chains and terms
For the narrators in the chain, I'll use ALA-LC transliteration with diacritics, like “ʿAmr b. ʿAwn.” In the matn, I'll stick to common forms like “Ibn Abbas” without diacritics, as instructed. I’ll also translate terms like "the Prophet ﷺ" and “may Allah be pleased with him” where relevant, keeping consistency.

Translating technical terms and hadith chain
For the translation, I’ll stick to the guideline of not using Arabic script outside the chain of narration. I’ll translate "ilḥād" as "deviation" or "impiety," based on context, without transliterating it, since other Arabic terms shouldn't be transliterated in the text. I'll keep the brackets and translate inside them, like "[al-Ḥasan b. ʿAlī narrated to us]."

Translating and crafting chain details accurately
For the translation, I’ll follow the guideline that chain names are transliterated but other parts of the text should just be translated by meaning, like "Abū ʿĀṣim al-Nabīl" and "Jaʿfar b. Yaḥyā b. Thawbān." For the hadith explanation, I’ll translate technical terms without transliterating them, such as "marfuʿ" as "attributed to the Prophet ﷺ" or "mawqūf" as "stopped at the companion."

Translating hadith and terminology accurately
For the headings, I’ll translate "The grading of the hadith as marfuʿ and as mawqūf" and "What has been related regarding the nabidh of the watering-place" keeping everything in lowercase beyond the brackets. For specific terms, I’ll use "wine (khamr)" where needed for clarity, while maintaining "sawiq" for consistency. Transliterations will be kept minimal following the guidelines.

Translating chain and terminology correctly
For consistency, I’ll use ALA-LC transliteration for names within the chain, such as "ʿAmr b. ʿAwn" and "Ḥumayd b. Abī Ḥumayd al-Ṭawīl." In the explanation, I’ll keep “Ibn ʿAbbās” with diacritic when referring to a narrator in the chain but use plain “Ibn Abbas” elsewhere. As for other terms like "sawiq" and "Zamzam," I’ll stick with standard English representations.

Clarifying transliteration boundaries
In this hadith, we need to transliterate only the names in the chain with diacritics, such as "al-Qaʿnabī" and "ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz." However, terms like "al-ṣadr" should be translated for meaning instead of transliterated since it's not a narrator's name. I'll translate "al-ṣadr" as "after departure [from Mina]" to maintain clarity without violating the rule.

I need to make sure I translate all segments as plain text, avoiding Arabic characters (except ﷺ). For the isnad (chain of narration), I'll use ALA-LC transliteration with diacritics (e.g., "al-Qaʿnabī"). For other parts, I might use standard English spelling of narrator names, based on the instruction for the chain.

Deciding on transliteration for narrator names outside of isnad
I need to strictly follow instructions—only using ALA-LC transliteration for narrator names within the isnad (chain excerpts). For biographical sections or mentions outside the chain, I can use English spellings or Anglicized versions, without diacritics, as they aren't part of the chain itself.

Clarifying transliteration for narrator names outside of the isnad
The instruction is clear: only apply ALA-LC transliteration to the names of narrators in the chain (isnad). While biographical sections mention narrators, they aren't part of the chain, so I’ll stick to common English spellings there. To be safe though, ALA-LC could still be okay.

Deciding on consistent transliteration for narrator names
The instruction says to use ALA-LC transliteration only in the chain for narrator names, but doesn't specify other sections, so I can transliterate narrator names outside the chain too. I’ll apply ALA-LC consistently across the work for clarity, while avoiding transliterating technical terms unless necessary.

Translating specific religious terms and preserving consistency
I should translate "God" as "Allah" in appropriate contexts. For phrases like صلى الله عليه وسلم or عليه الصلاة والسلام, I’ll use ﷺ as instructed, since they have the same meaning. Also, terms like "رضي الله عنه" should be translated as “may Allah be pleased with him.” I’ll keep technical terms like "biographical note" consistent throughout.

Translating and handling Arabic terms and numerals
For phrases like "حج بي مع رسول الله ... وأنا ابن سبع سنين," I'll translate literally, ensuring standardization. I’ll convert Arabic-Indic numerals to Western digits and avoid Arabic characters except for ﷺ. For technical terms like "al-ṣadr," I’ll either transliterate or explain contextually as "departure from Mina."

Translating technical terms with clarity
The term "al-ṣadr" can be tricky, as it refers to the departure after Hajj, specifically from Mina to Mecca. I'll go for "after departing from Mina" to clarify the meaning, avoiding confusion—instead of using direct transliteration, which feels more fitting for technical terms like this one.

Translating a hadith with chain of narration
I'd translate the hadith as: "al-Qaʿnabī narrated to us, from Mālik, from Nāfiʿ, from ʿAbd Allāh ibn ʿUmar, may Allah be pleased with them, that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ entered the Kaʿbah, along with Usāmah ibn Zayd, ʿUthmān ibn Ṭalḥah, and Bilāl, may Allah be pleased with them. Then it was closed upon him..."

Translating the chain and hadith details
For the first chain, I need to transliterate names like "ʿAbd Allāh ibn Muḥammad ibn Isḥāq al-Azramī." Then in the commentary, I’ll refer to how the distance of three cubits is used as evidence for how far passers-by are from the prayer space without a sutrah.

For the next hadith, it mentions "I forgot to ask how many rakʿahs." I'll be careful on the translation for "may Allah be pleased with him/with them both" when dealing with the dual form.

Translating dual pronouns and addressing isnad details
For the dual pronoun issue, I’ll stick to "may Allah be pleased with him" since it's a well-established translation. The dual could refer to Umar and the Prophet, but I’ll go with the safe option here. Then, in the commentary, I'll mention the isnad evaluation, noting which narrators are considered trustworthy and their inclusion or weakness in various collections. I'll also convert the Arabic punctuation to proper format and apply ALA-LC transliteration for names.

Handling transliteration for technical terms and biographical details
I’ll stick to using the ALA-LC system for narrators' names in the chain. For technical terms like “sutrah,” “isnād,” and “ḥadīth,” I'll keep the transliteration to clarify key concepts but won’t include Arabic letters. I’ll also provide literal translations for specific terms, like the "Ḥijr Ismāʿīl," and refine the translations for clarity.

I've pinpointed the source material: Sharh Sunan Abu Dawud by Abdul Muhsin al-Abbad. The objective is clear – translating Arabic prose into its English equivalent. This initial analysis forms the bedrock for my subsequent linguistic processing and adaptation stages.

Analyzing Narration Chains

I'm now fully immersed in the mechanics of processing P1425. I'm carefully translating the narration chains while staying true to the source's intricate linguistic and stylistic nuances. This requires an in-depth understanding of the context and the meaning of religious terms used, ensuring I render them accurately. I'm focusing on the narrator biographies to maintain the integrity of the information.

Identifying Key Narrators

I'm zeroing in on the specific narrators in the chain for P1425. I've pinpointed Muslim ibn Ibrahim al-Farahidi, a trustworthy figure mentioned in the six books, alongside Shu'bah ibn al-Hajjaj, also trustworthy. Sa'd ibn Ibrahim, another reliable source, is also part of the chain. My focus now is on understanding their individual contributions within this specific hadith's context. I need to note their roles and ensure clarity on who is narrating from whom, while preserving the original structure.

Expanding Hadith Understanding

I'm now diving into the details of P1426, which focuses on Abu Barzah al-Aslami's narration about prayer times. I'm carefully translating and analyzing the context, paying close attention to the nuances within the hadith. I'm striving to capture the original intent, especially phrases like "sun is alive" and "forgot Maghrib," ensuring they resonate correctly in English. I'm noting the implied meanings, such as why sleep before Isha was disliked. I'm also grappling with the phrase "Whoever is occupied by the obligatory from the optional is excused..." in order to provide a thorough explanation.

Dissecting Hadith Details

I'm now fully engrossed in P1427. I'm carefully dissecting the hadith narrated by Abu Barzah al-Aslami, focusing on key phrases like "the sun was alive" and "I forgot Maghrib." I'm determining the significance of the delay in Isha prayer and the Prophet's preferences. Understanding the specific meanings behind the narration, like the "split of the night", is paramount. I'm also analyzing the nuances of the Fard vs Nafl principle. I'm also clarifying how the phrase "the sun was alive" relates to prayer times. I also need to provide full context on why it's recommended not to talk after Isha.

Exploring Narrator Chains

I'm presently building biographies for the narrators in P1427, like Ḥafṣ ibn ‘Umar ibn al-Ḥārith ibn Sakhbarah, and the Rubā‘ī chain logic. Also, I'm working on understanding the heading: time of Dhuhr prayer for P1428. I am also currently working on the context for P1429, which focuses on cooling gravel for Sujud due to heat, and the chain involved in this narration.

Analyzing Shadow Length

I'm now clarifying the seasonal variations in shadow length relevant to Dhuhr prayer for P1431. I'm focusing on the specifics: summer's 3-5 feet versus winter's 5-7 feet. Next, I'll dive into P1430, focusing on the biographical context and the terms associated with the narrators. I'm also planning to explore the biographies in P1432.

Detailing Narrator Biographies

I'm now focusing on P1432, meticulously building the biographical profiles of the narrators. I'm focusing on defining 'Uthman ibn Abi Shaybah, and others, including their significance within the tradition. I'm also preparing for the next section, P1433, which covers the concept of cooling Dhuhr in extreme heat, and the related narration.

Unpacking Related Hadiths

I'm now grappling with P1434 and P1435. I'm building biographical details for the narrators, including Abū al-Walīd al-Ṭayālisī and Ibn Shihāb al-Zuhrī. I'm cross-referencing chains and contextualizing the Ibrad hadith variations. Focusing on the concept of Bilal calling Adhan, I'm analyzing the meaning of Talul.

Processing Related Narrations

I'm now fully occupied with P1437-P1440. Currently, P1437's biographies are in my purview, including figures like Mūsá ibn Ismā‘īl al-Tabūdhakī. Next, I'll analyze Asr prayer times in P1438, which involves understanding that dahadat means zalat. P1439 is next, where I'll render the explanation about the Prophet's Asr prayers and the sun being "white, high and alive." Finally, I'm defining al-'Awali, including Al-Zuhrī's explanation of distance and biographies in P1440.

Elaborating on Narrations

I'm now focusing on P1441-P1444. I've defined "sun is alive" as feeling its heat within P1441's context. I'm noting the biographies for the narrators, including Yūsuf ibn Mūsá. Next, P1442 involves Aisha's narration about the sun in her room before sunrise. I am drafting the basic biography for P1443, focusing on figures such as Al-Qa‘nabī. Lastly, I'm defining the meaning of Asr delay for P1444, and noting the narrations of Ali ibn Shayban.

Defining Current Narrations

I'm presently building biographies for P1445, noting unknown and specific narrators. Simultaneously, I'm analyzing the context of P1446, the Battle of the Trench, and the explicit identification of the "Middle Prayer" as Asr. I'm also starting the standard bio for P1447, while also reviewing previous entries.

Examining Textual Evidence

I'm now interpreting P1448, analyzing Aisha's perspective on the "Middle Prayer," recognizing its unique reading as Asr, and identifying this as an unusual, shadh reading. I'm focusing on P1449 to draft the standard biographical profiles for its narrators, including Zayd ibn Aslam and Al-Qa‘qā‘ ibn Ḥakīm. Finally, for P1450, I'm examining Zayd ibn Thabit's narration regarding Dhuhr in the midday heat, and evaluating textual evidence that supports Asr's claim for the "Middle Prayer".

Defining Hadith Details

I'm now fully immersed in P1451-P1454. In P1451, I've detailed biographies for Muhammad ibn al-Muthanná (al-Zaman/Ghundar distinction), ‘Amr ibn Abī Ḥakīm, and Al-Zibriqān. P1452 now clarifies that catching one Rak'ah is considered as catching Asr or Fajr prayers, focusing on Daruri time. I've drafted P1453's biographies with Al-Ḥasan ibn al-Rabī‘, Ibn al-Mubārak, and Ṭāwūs. I will now analyze P1454.

Elaborating on Hadith Details

I'm now fully engaged with P1454, clarifying the hypocrite's prayer and its association with the sun's yellow hue, connecting it to the devil's horns. I'm building biographical details for P1455, including Al-‘Alā’ ibn ‘Abd al-Raḥmān al-Ḥuraqī. Also, I'm working to articulate P1456, which focuses on the ramifications of missing Asr, interpreting watira. Further, I'm building a bio for P1457, focusing on Nāfi‘. I'm focusing on parsing linguistic variations of Watira for P1458.

Refining Linguistic Choices

Currently, I'm working to articulate the varied interpretations of "Watira," particularly within P1458. Simultaneously, I'm engaged in the intricacies of P1459, where Al-Awza'i's definition of "missing" is pivotal. Moreover, biographical details and kunya identifications are the focus in P1460, aiming to prevent possible misinterpretations. Lastly, I am getting ready for P1461, focusing on the time of Maghrib prayer.

Reviewing Linguistic Accuracy

I'm now meticulously reviewing my translations of P1433, particularly the phrase min fayh jahannam. After careful consideration, I've decided to use "exhalation" or "intense heat" to best capture its meaning of vehemence, while maintaining consistency. I'm also addressing the capitalization of "ibn" and ensuring all diacritics are properly rendered in names. Finally, I'm confirming that the hadiths are sequentially numbered and formatted in plain text.

I've begun dissecting the request, focusing on the translator's role and the source text, Sharh Sunan Abu Dawud. I'm zeroing in on the specific nuances needed for Islamic content.

Define Translation Parameters

I've established the translation guidelines, focusing on high accuracy and literalness with preservation of Islamic terms and isnads. ALA-LC transliteration will be reserved for narrator names. I've also incorporated specific formatting rules, including the proper handling of religious salutations and the prohibition of formatting chapter headings in uppercase. My review process will involve three stages: markers, context/accuracy, and transliteration.

Examining Textual Evidence

I'm now deep into the commentary on hadith about prayer times, focusing on Gabriel's guidance to the Prophet. I've been dissecting the phrases "قدر الشراك," "الفيء," "ظله مثله," and "ظله مثليه" to understand the precise meaning related to the timing of prayers. I'm focusing on accurately conveying the distinctions between the optional and necessary prayer times within this context.

Delving Deeper into Time

I'm now grappling with the nuanced differences in prayer times detailed in the hadith. I've refined my understanding of key phrases, like "man ḥāma ḥawl al-ḥimā" and "Ghalas." I'm also cataloging the narrators for the Ibn 'Abbas hadith, which includes Musaddad, Yaḥyā, Sufyān, and 'Abd al-Raḥmān. I'm focusing on getting the biographical information right.

Exploring Hadith Narrators

I'm now focusing on the chain of narration for the hadith, examining narrators like Muhammad ibn Salamah al-Murādī, Ibn Wahb, and Usāmah ibn Zayd al-Laythī. I'm noting specific terms like "Thiqah," "Ṣadūq," and "Awḥām" in relation to them. The narratives about Abū Mas'ūd al-Anṣārī are also being examined. This process is helping me understand the reliability and context of the hadith's transmission. The Asr prayer delay story adds interesting historical insight.

Revisiting Narrations

I'm now tracing the hadith "Gabriel came down..." across multiple paths. I'm focusing on the additional narrators and cross-referencing biographical details. Specifically, I am cross-referencing Muhammad ibn Salamah al-Murādī, Ibn Wahb, Usāmah ibn Zayd al-Laythī, Ibn Shihāb, 'Urwah ibn al-Zubayr, Bashīr ibn Abī Mas'ūd, and his father. Additionally, I am comparing the version provided by other students of al-Zuhrī to see how this affects meaning.

Cataloging Further Narrators

I'm now identifying the narrators associated with additional ahadith on prayer times and verifying their biographical information, namely Sufyān ibn 'Uyaynah, Shu'ayb ibn Abī Ḥamzah, Al-Layth ibn Sa'd, Hishām ibn 'Urwah, and Ḥabīb ibn Abī Marzūq. I'm also cataloging the narrations themselves, including those of Wahb ibn Kaysān from Jābir (Maghrib), Abū Hurayrah, and 'Abd Allāh ibn 'Amr, with a specific focus on the chains of transmission, such as Ḥassān ibn 'Aṭiyah -> 'Amr ibn Shu'ayb -> Father -> Grandfather. The analysis of the narration "The time is between these two" is also ongoing, and I'm tracing the isnad.

Clarifying Temporal Dimensions

I'm now fully immersed in the hadith of Gabriel, focusing on the practical demonstration over two days. I'm carefully analyzing the key phrases: "Inshaqqa al-fajr" for the first day's dawn and "Amsá" and "Wa huwa a'lam" used for the second day's evening. I've also identified the isnad of "The time is between these two," and am tracing the chain through Musaddad, 'Abd Allāh ibn Dāwūd, Badr ibn 'Uthmān, Abū Bakr ibn Abī Mūsá, and Abū Mūsá al-Ash'arī, as well as a new chain from Jabir.

Investigating Narrations Now

I'm now cataloging more ahadith, specifically, one related to prayer times through Jābir, tracing the isnad through Sulaymān ibn Mūsá al-Ashdaq, 'Aṭā' ibn Abī Rabāḥ, and Ibn Buraydah. I'm noting the varying reliability of narrators and their links. Furthermore, I'm examining a narration about Zuhr prayer, tracing its chain from 'Ubayd Allāh ibn Mu'ādh to 'Abd Allāh ibn 'Amr, with emphasis on the concept of boundaries of prayer.

Tracing Narrations Further

I'm now fully immersed in the hadith narratives focused on prayer times. I've begun an in-depth exploration of the chain for the hadith regarding the Zuhr prayer, emphasizing the narrators involved. I'm focusing on the narration's interpretation of "The time is between these two," and its connection to the concept of temporal boundaries. I am now examining how this narrative applies to seeking knowledge in this field. I'm tracing the isnads for these hadiths with a meticulous eye toward the narrators' reliability and interconnections.

Refining Time Boundaries

I'm presently focusing on the nuances of time boundaries in the hadith, especially the Isha prayer. I'm carefully analyzing the chain of narration involving Muslim ibn Ibrāhīm, Shu'bah, and Sa'd ibn Ibrāhīm. The terms "hājirah" and "ghalas" are also under close scrutiny to solidify how the Prophet's prayers were timed.

I've just begun a deep dive into the initial parameters. Analyzing the request for the translation of Sharh Sunan Abu Dawud, I'm focusing on key aspects: the source text's nature and the desired translation style. Precision is paramount, so a literal approach will be favored unless contextual understanding demands a more flexible interpretation.

Establishing Translation Protocols

My focus has shifted towards the intricate details of the translation process. I'm solidifying the specific rules: preserving full chains of narration, ALA-LC for narrator names, the translation of greetings and key phrases, and formatting preferences. I'm keen to ensure no Arabic characters appear in the output aside from the specific symbol. The plain-text requirement is being considered. I'm finalizing the three-pass revision strategy.

Dissecting Narration Chains

I'm now deep in the hadith's narration chain, analyzing each transmitter meticulously. Specifically, I'm examining each sub-segment in the chain for Jarh wa Ta'dil, including the varying names of the narrators. The biographical details of each transmitter are crucial. I'm cross-referencing sources like Al-Mizzi's Tuhfat al-Ashraf to verify each person. The status of Umm Yūnus bint Shaddād, unfortunately, is still unknown. Finally, I'm analyzing the narrator's familial relationships.

Determining Hadith Authenticity

I'm now concluding the analysis of the narration chain for Hadith 1383. The hadith will be considered ḍa'īf due to the presence of two unknown narrators in the chain. I've now switched my focus to the core text.

I've translated Hadith 1382 and its title, then proceeded to the Hadith text and its explantion, including the complete narration chain for the latter. I'm now composing a brief explanation of the hadith, including it's ruling on spit being filthy, but not impure. Finally, I'm documenting the biographies of each narrator to support my findings.

Investigating Hadith Chains

I've just begun a detailed examination of Hadith 1385's chain of transmission. This chain, connected via Anas, is particularly noteworthy as a rubā'ī, featuring only four narrators between Abu Dawud and the Prophet. It presents a high chain ('ālī') due to the limited number of narrators. I am looking at hadith 1386 and 1387.

Exploring Theological Nuances

I'm now diving into the theological implications of several hadiths. For instance, I've clarified the legal context of tawarruk in prayers and established that madhī doesn't break a fast. Additionally, I'm analyzing the rulings on tahiyyat al-masjid during specific times. I'm also examining the scholarly critique of a hadith related to Umar's Umrah, noting its weakness. Finally, I'm examining the theological positions and rulings of Ibn Hajar and Al-Nawawi in creed.

Examining Scholarly Accuracy

I'm now reconciling different theological stances. Delving into the context of Hadith 1393, I'm clarifying that the hadith implies dogs didn't urinate inside the mosque. The implication is that they merely passed through, and the absence of sprinkling water suggests no certainty of impurity. I'm exploring the implications of their passage. I'm also addressing the Ahl al-Sunnah status of Ibn Hajar, and other similar scholars. I'm concluding that the errors are submerged in their vast correctness, and that they are of the Ahl al-Sunnah.

Summarizing Legal Details

I'm presently focusing on the nuances of marriage and related rulings. I've covered Hadith 1395, clarifying the permissibility of marrying a woman pregnant from adultery but emphasizing that the child is not attributed to the father. Then, I've analyzed Hadith 1396, which introduces prayer as the greatest pillar after the Shahada. I'm now drafting a concise explanation of the latter, along with my findings.

Clarifying Prayer's Significance

I'm now delving into the introduction of the Kitab al-Salah. I've covered the structure, placing purification first. I'm examining prayer's linguistic and technical definitions, exploring their interplay. I'm focusing on its status as a pillar of Islam, referencing key hadiths, including the Mi'raj narrative and related proofs. Finally, I'm documenting the importance of prayer as the first accountability on Judgement Day.

Reflecting on Hadith Details

I'm presently focusing on key hadiths regarding prayer. I've delved into Hadith 1400 and 1401, analyzing their implications. The importance of prayer is evident from these narratives, with the 'Aflaḥa in ṣadaqa' concept standing out. The chain of narration for Hadith 1401 is now under review, considering the text's significance. My aim is to synthesize concise explanations.

Analyzing Forbidden Speech

I'm now closely examining Hadith 1402, focusing on the prohibition of swearing by other than Allah. I've dissected the hadith text and proposed potential reconciliations, including the pre-prohibition context, habitual speech not intended as oaths, and an anomalous narration. My conclusion underscores that such swearing is forbidden, with Ibn Mas'ūd's insightful point highlighting the superiority of monotheism even when combined with a lie. I'm moving on to compiling biographies of narrators in Hadith 1403.

Analyzing Prayer Timings

I'm presently focusing on the intricacies of prayer timings, meticulously analyzing the text and structure of specific hadiths related to fixed prayer times. I'm focusing on the times themselves, marked by natural signs, and their corresponding terminologies. I'm dissecting the definitions of Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, Isha, and Fajr, clarifying their beginning and end times. Additionally, I'm noting the concept of iḍṭirār. Finally, I'm examining and documenting the chain of narration for the hadith of Jibril leading prayer, paying close attention to the details.

Summarizing Time Parameters

I'm presently focusing on the nuances of time measurement in religious contexts. Examining Hadith details, I've outlined the chain of transmission from Hakim Ibn Hakim to Ibn Abbas. I've dissected Gabriel's leadership in prayer timings, clarifying the two days of observations. Daylight and twilight serve as key visual indicators for prayer times. Additionally, I've validated all narrator transliterations.

Reviewing Terminology Accuracy

I've just finalized my review of key terms, confirming all narrator names are correctly identified and verified. I've double-checked that "Allah" is consistently used for "God." I'm now polishing specific hadiths for accuracy. In particular, I'm verifying the distinction of al-Dhuhli references and translating "Sūrah Shamsīyah" as "photograph" for greater clarity.

I've zeroed in on the specifics: I need to translate Arabic text from Sharh Sunan Abu Dawud, which deals with Islamic Hadith studies. The focus is now on accurately conveying the theological and scholarly nuances of this specific work. This is the bedrock of my translation, and everything builds from here.

Refining Translation Parameters

I'm now integrating new rules into the workflow. Preservation of full Sanad chains is prioritized. I'll utilize ALA-LC transliteration for narrators, and "Allah" replaces "God". I'll also ensure "ﷺ" is maintained in the text, and there will be no other Arabic characters. I must also keep the numeric IDs and the specified $ rule for LaTeX in mind. Lastly, chapter headings should not be in all uppercase, and I will translate them too.

Analyzing Urgency and Details

I'm now deep into a particular segment, P1350, dissecting Al-Hasan Al-Basri's statement on urine. I've begun to draft the translation, meticulously considering the nuanced meanings and theological implications. I'm focusing on the distinctions between Nadh and Ghasl, as well as the concepts of Najis and Tahir. I am also working with the hadith distinctions, and how the exception for edible animals plays a role in the translation.

Dissecting Hadith Details

I'm presently dissecting P1350 and the ensuing narrations, focused on the hadith related to urine. The nuances regarding the Hadith of the "Uranīyīn" are clear, and I'm drafting the translation. I'm focusing on Al-Hasan Al-Basri's statement, contrasting concepts like Nadh and Ghasl, and how they interplay with Najis and Tahir. The differentiation between edible animal urine and human urine, specifically in relation to the boy's sprinkling, is coming into focus. I've also checked on the biographies and found that Al-Hasan Al-Basri is Thiqah, though Harun b. Tamim has no biography.

Analyzing Narrative Chains

Presently, I'm working with P1353, focusing on a new route for the hadith, a Marfu' tradition. It's becoming clearer that the distinction lies in whether one consumes food or not. Regarding P1354, I'm focusing on the Isnad's biographies: the narrators, including Mu‘ādh ibn Hishām and his father, Hishām. It seems Mu‘ādh ibn Hishām is Saduq, but potentially has wahm (mistakes). However, Hishām is Thiqah (trustworthy).

Examining Narrations Now

I'm now deep into the Athar of Umm Salamah, P1356. I'm focusing on the implications of "pouring water" over the boy's urine, which suggests sprinkling rather than scrubbing. I'm also examining the biographies of the narrators, including Khayrah, who is Maqbulah, and Umm Salamah, the Mother of Believers. I've drafted translations for the title of P1357, "The ruling of the ground affected by urine," and for P1358, which is the hadith of the Bedouin.

Clarifying Narrative Details

I'm translating P1358 and contemplating the Bedouin incident. The Prophet's response, "You were sent as facilitators...", resonates. The Fiqh implies ground purification with water, not digging. The phrase "constricted something vast" points to Allah's mercy. Understanding the La tuzrimuhu (Do not interrupt his urination) is crucial. I'm moving on to P1359 and its insights into the wisdom behind the Prophet's actions. Finally, I'll review P1360, focusing on the biographies.

Reviewing P1361-P1363

I'm now analyzing the Isnad for Ibn Ma'qal's Hadith. I've pinpointed Ibn 'Abdah, cross-referencing Tahdhib al-Tahdhib to identify the correct Ahmad b. 'Abdah. I'm scrutinizing the narrative chain, paying close attention to Sufyan Ibn 'Uyaynah, Al-Zuhri, Sa'id b. al-Musayyib, and Abu Hurayrah. I've begun reviewing P1361, noting it is Mursal and contradicts Sahih hadith. I'm also preparing for P1362 and 1363.

Addressing Ambiguities and Nuances

I'm now grappling with the concept of "Badw" in the Yusuf verse, noting it doesn't equate to Bedouin status. Prophets aren't Bedouins, and a shift to the desert doesn't alter a person's status. I've translated P1364 which provides a brief intro, as well as P1365's title regarding ground purification through drying. Currently, I'm working through P1366, reconciling the hadith about dogs urinating in the mosque with the idea of ground purification, and the implications of open versus roofed spaces.

Investigating Impurity Regulations

I'm now comparing and contrasting indoor and outdoor purification methods. I'm focusing on P1366, reconciling the hadith about dogs in the mosque with the differing approaches to dealing with impurity. The emphasis is on whether the impurity is known, visible, or not, and I'm refining my understanding of the implications of "sprinkling" versus drying. My goal is to grasp the nuances in Sheikh's reasoning.

Evaluating Purification Methods

I am now focusing on P1370, delving into the biographies of the narrators of Umm Salamah's Hadith. I am investigating the identity of "Umm Walad of Ibrahim b. 'Abd al-Rahman b. 'Awf," considering the possibility of a misidentification and consulting Tahdhib al-Kamal. Subsequently, in P1371, I am analyzing a narration concerning a woman from Banu 'Abd al-Ashhal and the Prophet's response regarding a smelly road, and I am clarifying how rain and clean soil affect the purification process.

Detailing Narrator Biographies

Currently, I'm working through P1372, meticulously researching the biographies of the narrators within the Isnad, including Al-Nufayli and Zuhayr, focusing on their reliability. Next, I am reviewing P1373 and the related Hadith, P1374, concerning the purification of sandals. I'm focusing on the differences in cleaning depending on the location of the filth. Finally, I'll be investigating P1375.

Reviewing Hadith and Biographies

I'm presently delving into P1377-P1380. I'm focusing on the Hadith details and biographies. Ahmad b. Ibrahim is Thiqah, though Muhammad b. Kathir (Al-San'ani) is weak, with mistakes. P1378 revisits 'Aishah's hadith; I'm studying the Isnad, including Mahmud b. Khalid, and the variations between narrators. My focus is now on the nuances of impurities on garments and how the Prophet addressed them. This builds on my earlier work examining narrations and theological nuances.

Revising Garment Narratives

I'm now revising the translation related to the Prophet's garment and the blood spot. The 'Iadah is not about the prayer itself, but washing the garment. The hadith is weak due to two unknown women. I'm focusing on the subtle nuances of Shi'ar, Kisa', Lum'ah, and Sarrura. I've also incorporated the correct definitions of key biographical terms, such as Maqbulah and Umm Walad.

Integrating Foundational Principles

I'm now incorporating my previous updates into a cohesive framework. I'm focusing on consistency in terminology and biographical representation. I've reviewed difficult phrases and integrated the specific definitions for "Ibn" within names. I'm prioritizing accuracy within my definitions. I've also checked all the format details, and I am satisfied with the work thus far.

Refining the Translation

I'm presently revising the translation in P1380, grappling with the Sheikh's interpretation of "repetition." I've begun integrating the ALA-LC diacritics into the narrator names, ensuring that the transliteration only applies to the chains of narrators and not to the main text. I've also focused on the differences between the Prophet's speech and that of the narrator. Now, the emphasis will be on ensuring the precise conveying of the Sheikh's reasoning, rather than the translation. I've already checked and fixed the capitalization of the chapter title in P1380.

Examining Isnad Accuracy

I'm now carefully reviewing and cross-checking the Isnad chains in the upcoming sections, ensuring the accurate ALA-LC transliteration of the narrators' names. I am also working on standardizing the format of the narrators names, and verifying that the biographies are correct. The goal is precision for P1381, P1382 and beyond.

I'm now focusing on thoroughly analyzing the translation request. I'm noting the source text's nature and the specified task (Arabic-to-English translation). I'm also starting to get a sense of the tone and purpose, and I'm aware of the need to stay faithful to the original text.

Detailing the Approach

I'm deep into the technical specifications now. Accuracy is paramount, favoring a literal approach unless the context strongly dictates otherwise. I'm prioritizing the correct Islamic terminology and focusing on the required plain text format, remembering to retain the specified IDs. I'm carefully documenting all the instructions I was given, to stay compliant. Also, I'm ensuring all the specific translation guidelines are followed. For example, maintaining the full isnad and using the correct transliteration rules.

Elaborating on Context

I'm now carefully examining the hadith regarding relieving oneself. I'm focusing on the isnad and content, noting the prohibition of facing or backing the Qiblah. I'm taking special note of the phrasing "Sharriqū aw gharribū," which means "face east or west," and how this directive varies based on location. I am also making sure I clearly understand the terms like "marāḥīḍ" and "munḥarif."

Dissecting the Isnad

I'm now focusing on the isnad, carefully analyzing the chain of narration for the "Not facing the two Qiblahs" hadith. I've noted the narrators: Mūsá b. Ismā‘īl, Wuhayb b. Khālid, ‘Amr b. Yaḥyá, Abū Zayd, and Ma‘qil b. Abī Ma‘qil al-Asadī. I'm especially focused on the Sheikh's critique, as he deems the hadith unestablished, pointing out the geographical inconsistencies of the Jerusalem-facing prohibition.

Exploring Further Details

I've now moved on to examining the athar of Ibn 'Umar, where he used his camel as a screen while facing the Qiblah for urination. I'm noting the differences between open spaces and built-up areas, and the importance of screening. Additionally, I'm carefully reviewing the biographies of the narrators, including their strengths and weaknesses. I'm also now understanding the general etiquette derived from Sunan Abu Dawud. Finally, I have started investigating the Hadith of Ibn 'Umar, where he saw the Prophet ﷺ on two bricks.

Connecting the Narrations

I'm presently reconciling the various pieces of evidence. I've noted a potential framework: Abū Ayyūb's hadith seems relevant for open spaces, while Ibn 'Umar's applies to built-up areas. The overarching directive remains: avoid facing the Qiblah during elimination if feasible, regardless of the setting.

I'm currently engaged with the isnad. I'm focusing now on the chain: ‘Abd Allāh b. Maslamah, Mālik, Yaḥyá b. Sa‘īd, Muḥammad b. Yaḥyá b. Ḥabbān, Wāsi‘ b. Ḥabbān, and Ibn ‘Umar. I've made note of the various discussions regarding Yaḥyá b. Sa‘īd. I am now looking at the layers of Tabi'in.

Analyzing Contradictions

I'm now focusing on the Prophet's actions. I've noted a potential contradiction - a prohibition followed by a later action. I am now exploring potential interpretations of this sequence of events. Specifically, I'm considering whether it suggests abrogation (naskh) or if reconciliation (jam') offers a more appropriate explanation. The distinction between open space and buildings is now in my mind. The isnad chain in view are: b. Jarīr -> Jarīr -> Muḥammad b. Isḥāq -> Abān b. Ṣāliḥ -> Mujāhid -> Jābir b. ‘Abd Allāh. Also, I am now carefully analyzing the content.

Refining Interpretations

I'm now zeroing in on interpretations regarding speaking during elimination. I've considered that even with possible isnad issues, the core concept of modesty remains valid. I am further delving into the biographical details, as the narrators in the Bayhaqi chain have clarified 'the vague man' as al-Qāsim b. Muḥammad. Additionally, I am currently comparing the "mursal khafi" and tadlis classifications of the narrations. I am now also analysing the hadith in P102.

Revisiting Narrators

I'm now back at the narrators, this time focusing on P103, looking into the biographies to check out the narrators in P102. I'm focusing on the criticism surrounding figures like Ibn Mahdī and Yaḥyá b. Abī Kathīr and also studying the biographical data of 'Ubayd Allāh b. 'Umar, and Hilāl b. ‘Iyāḍ. I'm especially focused on the issues with Yaḥyá.

Analyzing Etiquette

I'm now focusing on specific hadiths concerning proper etiquette. For example, I am analyzing P108 on returning greetings while urinating, noting the Prophet's delayed response. I'm also considering P109, which details the greeting and the subsequent Tayammum before replying. Additionally, I'm noting the need to avoid mentioning Allah during elimination as mentioned in P107.

Detailing Mursal Definitions

I'm now carefully analyzing the nuances of "mursal" classifications. The key is in differentiating between the general and "mursal khafi." I'm also reviewing the biographies, particularly noting "Thiqah," "Saduq," and "Majhul" categorizations. I have now completed Pass 3 of the transliteration. I've re-checked terms like "Mawla" and the person "Marwan al-Asfar."

I've been meticulously analyzing the source material, specifically pages 73-84 of Sharh Sunan Abu Dawud by Abdul Muhsin al-Abbad, to fully grasp the nuances of the text. The goal is to ensure a thorough understanding of the specific content.

Detailing the Translation Workflow

I've moved on to meticulously translating and analyzing the text segment by segment, focusing intently on pages 73 and beyond. The primary emphasis remains on accurate conveyance of meaning, especially when navigating technical Islamic terminology. I'm adhering strictly to the stipulated style guide, ensuring the use of precise terms, proper ALA-LC transliteration for narrator names within chains, and consistent application of formatting requirements. I'm triple-checking each segment as it is revised.

Investigating Hadith Anomalies

I'm now delving into the intricacies of shādhdh narrations, focusing on the discussion concerning Shu'bah's narration. Al-Abbad refutes Al-Albani's categorization of it as shādhdh, offering the Eclipse Prayer as a contrasting example of an irreconcilable contradiction. I'm focusing on accurately conveying the concept of shādhdh, whether through translation as "anomalous" or by retaining the original technical term for clarity. The comparison between "A'ūdhu billāhi" and "Allāhumma innī a'ūdhu bika" is key. Also, I'm examining pages beyond 73, and including page 74's information.

Expanding Conceptual Understanding

I'm now focusing on a specific hadith chain: Shu'bah - Qatadah - al-Naḍr ibn Anas - Zayd ibn Arqam. I'm unpacking variations in wording, the meaning of "Khubuth and Khabā'ith" (male and female devils), and the concept of "Hushūsh" (privies) being "Muḥtaḍarah" (attended by devils). Key phrases include "Satr mā bayna al-jinn..." (The screen between the jinn and the private parts). On page 75, I'm analyzing the biography of 'Amr ibn Marzūq, noting he is trustworthy and that al-Bukhari and Abu Dawud narrated from him. Page 76 is revealing the creed of Ahl al-Sunnah concerning the Companions.

Synthesizing Foundational Principles

I'm now focusing on the core principles surrounding the Companions of the Prophet. Specifically, I'm examining 'Amr ibn Marzūq's rebuke of a Kharijite and the imperative to safeguard hearts and tongues concerning the Companions, drawing on Ibn Taymiyyah's Wasitiyyah. The concept of all Companions being upright and the rule of treating the "unknown" among them as "known" is key. Al-Khatib al-Baghdadi's Al-Kifayah is a useful resource here. Additionally, I've noted a strong warning against those who scrutinize the Companions. Moving to pages 77 and 78, I'm analyzing the etiquette of relieving oneself, specifically with regard to facing the Qiblah, using the right hand, and the proper use of stones, as well as the meaning of "Karahiyah" (dislike) here, which turns out to mean prohibition.

Unpacking Hadith Etiquette

I'm now diving into the specifics from pages 79-81, focusing on the Hadith of Salman al-Farsi and its implications. I'm exploring the chain and commentary on the meaning of "Khara'ah" (defecation etiquette). Examining Musaddad, Abu Mu'awiyah, Al-A'mash, Ibrahim, Abd al-Rahman ibn Yazid, and Salman's biographies, I'm noting Ibrāhīm al-Nakha'ī's rule on impurities. I'm also analyzing the theological argument presented: If the Prophet explained minor etiquette, he surely explained major creedal principles.

Contrasting Interpretations Assessed

I'm now grappling with Imam Malik's perspective on Divine Attributes, particularly Istiwā. Al-Abbad's argument is compelling: if the Prophet meticulously detailed bathroom etiquette, he wouldn't leave such a fundamental concept like Istiwā ambiguous. I've also noted that "Karahiyah," in early Islamic scholarship, could signify prohibition rather than mere dislike. Moving on, I'm now examining the "father" hadith, its chain, and the Prophet's teaching style.

Analyzing Narrative Depth

I'm now carefully examining the hadith chain starting with Al-Qa'qā' ibn Ḥakīm, moving through Abū Ṣāliḥ (Dhakwān al-Sammān), and concluding with Abū Hurayrah. I'm focusing on the reasons for Abū Hurayrah's prolific narration, including the Prophet's prayer and his dedication to learning. I've noted specific Arabic terms, such as shādhdh and thiqat, and will ensure their accurate translation. My primary goals are to translate the segment correctly and clarify subtle theological points regarding the Companions.

Reviewing Hadith Connections

I'm now back at pages 73-84, meticulously re-examining the relationships between narrations and the reliability of their chains. The Eclipse Prayer's anomalous narration is a clear example of shādhdh. I've also identified narrators who practice tadlis, like Shu'bah, clarifying their methods of narration. I'm focusing on the meaning of words like "rajī'" which are central to the hadith discussions.

Finalizing Terminology Refinements

I'm now zeroing in on precise Arabic terminology to ensure faithful translation. I'm focusing on key terms such as tafwid and ta'wil, ensuring their distinction is clearly conveyed. I'm also ensuring the correct capitalization of headings, and will complete a final check for "Allah" and "ﷺ" to complete the polish.

I'm currently focused on the source material. Diving deep into the Arabic text, specifically al-Dhahabi's Siyar A'lam al-Nubala, is crucial. I'm carefully analyzing its historical and biographical context to understand the nuances required for an accurate and insightful English translation. This foundational understanding will guide subsequent steps.

Outlining Translation Principles

I've established the core translation principles, which are highly specialized. Accuracy is paramount, leaning towards literal translation unless contextual understanding dictates otherwise. I'm focusing on correct Islamic terminology, preservation of full Isnad, and consistent transliteration using ALA-LC for narrator names.

My plan involves meticulous usage of Islamic terminology, maintaining plain text format, and retaining identifiers. I've broken down the translation process into three distinct revision phases: Alignment, Context/Accuracy, and Transliteration.

Defining Translation Scope

I'm now zeroing in on defining the precise scope. I've categorized the narrators as they are organized in the original text. I've pinpointed that the "headings" require ALA-LC transliteration for the names within them, but not the textual content, and am working through the initial "Front Matter" section.

Identifying Book Structure

I'm now mapping out the book's structural elements. I've pinpointed the content breakdown, from children to the verifier's biography. Next, I'll organize the "Sira" chapters with headings like "Bāb" and "Ghazwah," and note the recurring Quranic references. Finally, I'll tackle the biographies, focusing on precise ALA-LC transliteration for all names.

Organizing Biographies

I'm currently organizing the biographies based on their classes, as defined by the text. I've categorized them based on the text's "Tabaqat" structure, from Senior Tābi'ūn to the Seventh Class. I've also noted a minor typo that needed correction.

Focusing on Transliteration

I'm now focusing on the meticulous transliteration of names and phrases. I've compiled a list of commonly occurring names, like Muḥammad and ‘Alī, as well as complex ones, such as Zayd ibn ‘Amr ibn Nufayl. I'm also ensuring consistent handling of specific terms and phrases, such as "Allah" for "God" and "ﷺ" for "ṣallā Allāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam." I'm paying close attention to the requested use of "﵁" for "raḍiya Allāhu ‘anhu."

Implementing Honorific Translations

I am now implementing a translation plan for honorifics. Based on previous instructions, I will translate honorifics. Therefore, ﵁ will become "may Allah be pleased with him," ﵂ will become "may Allah be pleased with her," and ﵀ will become "may Allah have mercy on him." The prompt specified no Arabic characters except for ﷺ; therefore, I am changing my approach to honorifics. I am working through the text to apply these translations consistently.

Detailing Biographical Narrators

I'm now detailing the biographical narrators. I've focused on entries like Ibn Umm Maktūm, ‘Ā’ishah, Al-Majnūn (The Madman), Al-Akhṭal, Al-Farazdaq, Al-Kumayt, and Shu‘bah. I've corrected a potential typo in the source and clarified a term related to the class/generation. Based on the positioning, I am confident that T1256 refers to Sufyān al-Thawrī. I'm now conducting the final review against constraints.

Clarifying Classifications

I'm presently clarifying several biographical classifications, resolving potential ambiguities. I've noted a specific instance where "Tenth: His death" is a direct translation due to a skipped numeral, highlighting the importance of literal accuracy. I've also identified and corrected a typo in the original text, substituting "The Fifth Edition" with "The Fifth Class," a crucial contextual refinement. I'm now actively translating honorifics and IDs, such as "﵀," "﵂," and "﵁."

Confirming Transliterations

I'm now confirming the transliteration approach and standardizing on the specified characters for consistency. I've noted the preference for ' and ' for 'ع' and 'ء,' and I'm updating my current work accordingly. I'm focusing on "The Opening of Makkah" for consistency with the Islamic historical context. I'm reviewing and applying these refinements across the various entries, including names like Ibn Zabr, Abū Ḥamzah al-Sukkarī, and Mu‘āwiyah ibn Sallām. I've noted a few phrases and their contextual relevance.

I'm currently focused on the methodology for translating key biographical segments from Siyar A'lam al-Nubala. My recent work involves critically evaluating potential approaches to render the text accessible and accurate. This includes evaluating different interpretive strategies and translation methods, especially those relevant to dealing with the distinct stylistic nuances. I am currently honing the specifics of the approach, to best address the complexities of the source text.

Implementing the Constraints

I've been meticulously translating the initial segment, P5579, adhering to the stringent stylistic guidelines. This necessitates precise ALA-LC transliteration for narrator names within the isnad chain and ensuring the appropriate translation of religious terms like "Allah" and "ﷺ". I'm meticulously incorporating all specific translation choices, including how to handle the starting IDs of each segment. The segment's content on al-Bukhari's lineage and early life presents unique translation challenges.

The Hajj trip is a key event and the listing of teachers is a must.

Documenting the Scholars

I'm now detailing al-Bukhari's scholarly circle, with an emphasis on students like Tirmidhi and Ibn Khuzaymah, and any reported narrations. I'm noting the disputed Nasa'i narration. I'm also capturing statistics about his impact, specifically the impressive figure of 90,000 listeners of the Sahih. I'm then beginning to document the final transmitters of his work. I'm starting to review the sample hadith segments, including examples.

Charting the Methodology

I'm now detailing al-Bukhari's process for compiling the Sahih, highlighting his discipline and rigor. The story about compiling a concise book of Sunnah, at 18 after correcting al-Humaydi, is key. I'm focusing on the ritual purity and diligence he exhibited, including his claim of only including authentic hadith, and the meticulous thrice-revision process. Verification efforts with Ishaq Ibn Rahwayh are also captured. The night routine of waking 15-20 times adds further insight, and the dream about the Prophet emphasizes his devotion.

Expanding the Narrative

I am now focusing on the fascinating anecdotes about al-Bukhari's memory and scholarly prowess. Particularly, I'm captivated by the story about the 1,000 sheikhs. The Baghdad incident where he corrected 100 inverted hadiths is truly a highlight. The metaphor of "The Butting Ram" is a fitting description of his intellectual strength. Now, I'm documenting the Basra incident, which offers another lens into his approach to hadith dictation.

Examining the Incidents

I'm now documenting several intriguing incidents, notably his mastery of Basra narrators. The comparisons with Waki' and Ibn al-Mubarak, and his self-assessment regarding Ali ibn al-Madini, are key. I'm noting the compilation of Kitab al-I'tisam in one night. The Nishapur incident and the governor's challenge are also under review.

Evaluating Scholarly Praise

I'm now examining the praises heaped on al-Bukhari from his contemporaries, particularly the glowing endorsements of Muhammad ibn Salam, Yahya ibn Ja'far, and Qutaybah ibn Sa'id, with their powerful descriptions. I am particularly interested in the comparison with Ishaq and the interactions involving Shu'bah's potential errors. The skipped ID also means I have to jump to different pages when I extract these details.

Detailing Further Incidents

Currently, I'm focusing on the additional incidents and anecdotes. I've noted Bundar's praise of al-Bukhari, including comparisons to other scholars and the incident with Ibn Munir. Comparisons to a "Bāzil" (strong camel) and the reverence of Egyptian scholars are also key, as are transliteration of names.

Defining Key Terminology

I'm now grappling with the precise translation of key terms. The "Warraq" issue is settled, opting for "scribe" for clarity, while respecting the cultural context. I will translate Jarh wa Ta'dil terms like "Thiqah" and "Da'if" as they are. The Ilah translation is being carefully contextualized. Specific tricky segments like Bazdazbah, Shabbaka bayna asabi'ihi, Baladhur, and al-Kabsh al-Nattah are being dealt with directly, preserving the original flavor when appropriate. I've also incorporated formatting instructions to align with the prompt.

Reviewing Final Adjustments

I'm now implementing the last refinements. I've double-checked my ALA-LC transliterations, and the formatting is now compliant. The religious terms are correct. I'm ensuring no accidental markdown, and that all instructions are met. It's time to refine the meaning for smoother text. Now, I'm ready to craft the final output.

Defining Reporting Methods

I'm now focusing on distinctions between narration methods, translating Haddathana as "narrated to us" and Akhbarana as "informed us," as this nuance impacts accuracy. Additionally, I'm interpreting dates in the 700s accurately. I've also clarified the poetic reference in section P5586, and have confirmed that "Abu Jad" alludes to the alphabet. My final focus is to ensure the complete absence of Markdown formatting, as per instructions.

Clarifying Honorifics

I'm currently addressing honorifics and religious terminology to ensure consistency and precision. I've resolved to translate "Majusi" as "Magian" for historical accuracy. Also I've fixed the honorific phrase as I should and have to use the standard english honorific for it. I am now working on ensuring proper ALA-LC transliteration in narrations.

I've begun dissecting the source text, specifically al-Dhahabi's Siyar A'lam al-Nubala, aiming for an accurate English translation. The initial phase focused on identifying key vocabulary, idiomatic expressions, and potential challenges in conveying the original nuance. I'm now comparing available English translations of similar texts to inform my strategy.

Refining Translation Guidelines

I've solidified my translation guidelines, aligning with my expertise as an Islamic content translator. Accuracy is paramount, leaning towards literal translations unless context necessitates interpretation. I'm prioritizing precise Islamic terminology and adhering strictly to formatting constraints: plain text, keeping IDs, preserving Isnad chains with ALA-LC transliteration for narrators only, and translating Arabic content. "Allah" replaces "God," and "ﷺ" is consistently used. I've also implemented a three-pass mental revision process for accuracy.

Updating Biographies Data

I'm currently working to expand the biography entries. For Al-Mutqin, I'm focusing on his genealogy, teachers, students, and key events, including locations like Marw and Tus, and his death in either 302 or 303 AH.

I've also added the poignant anecdote of his weeping at poetry and the Dhu al-Nun story related to the Greatest Name. I included his wisdom on Adab, and also included his death year of 304. For Ibn al-Jallā’, I've built the entry around his title, "the Polisher/Clarifier," including a quotation about repentance and the story of his parents' dedication, and also included that he died in 306. I've almost finished the entry for Ibn Maṭar, adding details about his teachers, and noted his death in 306.

Refining Biographical Entries

I'm now revising the biographical details of Ibn Zāṭiyā, Ibn Ḥamduwayh, and Abū Ḥafṣ. For Ibn Zāṭiyā, I've added that he was blind toward the end of his life. For Ibn Ḥamduwayh, I've confirmed his source from Suwayd ibn Naṣr, and also I will add a judge to Abu Hafs' biography. I'm also maintaining the correct use of Arabic characters and Islamic technical terms. Currently, I am also checking and correcting Siyar Alam al-Nubala to become Biographies of Noble Figures and ensuring that no Markdown headers are added.

I'm currently focused on the initial analysis of the translation request. I'm breaking down the source text, Siyar A'lam al-Nubala, and pinpointing the desired English output. I'm also carefully noting the required tone to ensure the translation is accurate and appropriate.

I'm carefully translating the core arguments and counterarguments about the fate of the three brothers (pious, kafir, and child). I'm striving for precise rendering of the concepts of Salāmah and bid'ah. The goal is to convey the essence of this complex theological exchange accurately, noting al-Ash'arī's objection.

Mapping the Aftermath

I'm now analyzing the aftermath of the theological debate. The phrase "You knew his state, and mine. Why didn't you protect my interest?" has been identified as a key moment leading to al-Jubbā'ī's silence. Simultaneously, I've begun compiling biographical data from Siyar A'lam al-Nubala about Abū Quṣayy, Ibn Qīrāṭ, Ibn Abī Ghaylān, and al-Ṣaffār. I'm focusing on their key roles as Muhaddiths and Scholars, and am noting details concerning their chains of narration, students, death dates and, in some cases, critical assessments.

I'm presently cataloging biographical information from Siyar A'lam al-Nubala, specifically details concerning Al-Silafī's chain of narration and related critiques, focusing on Ibn Mandah's lineage (Persian origin) and his significant role as a Great Hafiz and debater. I'm also examining the Hadith segment relating to the Prophet's last meal and the literacy discussion, noting the gharīb nature and ṣāliḥ al-isnād of the former and Dhahabi's detailed commentary on the Ummī status of the Prophet in the latter.

Delving into Theological Nuances

I'm now analyzing the arguments presented concerning the Prophet's literacy and poetic capabilities. I'm focusing on the Andalusian controversy surrounding the Prophet's inscription of his name, and Dhahabi's defense that this doesn't diminish his status as Ummī. I'm also examining the wisdom behind this, as explained in Quran 29:48. Moreover, I'm now exploring the perspective that the phrase "We are an unlettered nation" denotes a general state, not absolute individual illiteracy. I'm also analyzing the critique of complex ancient math and astronomy, and examining the discussion on poetry, with focus on the Quranic verses that refute this claim.

Summarizing Biographical Entries

I'm currently summarizing biographical information from Siyar A'lam al-Nubala. This includes details about al-Anmāṭī (Hafiz, author of a Great Tafsir), al-Muhallabī (Shaykh of Shafi'is), and al-Simnānī (Hafiz, traveler).

I'm carefully cross-referencing this date with other historical events and figures to build a more complete picture. I am also working on the iterative process of self-correction with names.

Refining Terminology

I'm presently focused on the critical review of transliteration, and I'm ensuring adherence to ALA-LC standards, particularly for diacritics and long vowels. I'm carefully correcting formatting issues, such as the capitalization of chapter headings. I'm making sure that terms like "al-Jubbā'ī" and "al-Mufīd" are precisely rendered. Finally, I'm integrating the approved translations for key phrases like "silenced/confounded" and "impostors/Antichrists". I am also making sure that translations are formatted correctly (i.e. capitalization).

I'm currently focused on the source material, Siyar A'lam al-Nubala by al-Dhahabi. My initial analysis is underway, ensuring I grasp the nuances of the Arabic text before commencing the translation process for a professional English translation.

Refining Translation Parameters

My focus has shifted to establishing the translation parameters with precision. I'm diligently considering how to handle technical terms, isnad chains, and transliteration protocols. I'm also confirming specific stylistic choices, such as using "Allah" and handling ﷺ, to ensure consistency throughout the work. The review process, with its three distinct passes, is also firmly in my mind.

Analyzing Source Content

I've started translating and analyzing the content segment by segment. Right now, I'm immersed in the lives of Ibn Sayyid Ḥamduwayh and Ibn Bassām. I'm focusing on their key characteristics, significant figures associated with them, and notable incidents and anecdotes. For Ibn Sayyid Ḥamduwayh, the focus is his piety and spiritual states, and for Ibn Bassām it's his literacy and historical work. I'm also capturing the names of relevant individuals, ensuring accuracy and consistency.

Decoding Satire's Layer

I'm now focusing on the satirical verse about Al-Mu‘taḍid. The ambiguity of "durayrah" is fascinating. I'm carefully weighing whether it implies a trivial action or a physical ailment for the translation, exploring the nuance of the original Arabic. The key is conveying the intended mockery, considering the double meaning of the term. The literal translation is "Upon the heat of a pounce-pot/powder", but the context demands further investigation and contextual clarification.

Deciphering Nuances

I've just concluded the translation of the satirical verse. I'm choosing "fragrant powder" for durayrah to retain the mocking tone, highlighting potential effeminacy or madness. I've also incorporated the death dates and provided biographical details for key figures, starting with Al-Ḥusayn ibn Idrīs, including his narrations, critiques, and trustworthiness. I'm now processing information about Al-Sāmī, continuing to methodically capture critical names, critiques, and historical details.

This provides valuable context for understanding his intellectual contributions.

Expanding Biographical Data

I'm now focusing on Al-Nasā'ī's complex relationship with Mu'awiyah, exploring his reluctance to praise him. I've noted his potential martyrdom in Damascus due to this stance, and the discrepancies in his death location. Dhahabi's comparison to other prominent scholars highlights Al-Nasā'ī's expertise in Hadith. I'm also cataloging his key works, including Sunan and Khaṣā’iṣ, and delving into anecdotal details, such as his encounter with Hārith ibn Miskīn.

Cataloging Additional Insights

My current focus is on compiling more biographical details about Al-Nasā'ī, specifically his death in 303 AH and his notable Hadith, "Whoever does not trim his mustache is not one of us." I'm also exploring his connection to Nasai's works, as listed by Dhahabi. I'm also examining the reliability of his sources, like Baqiyyah, and delving into the distinction made between fixed and defective Hadith by prominent figures. I'm also cataloging the deaths around the time, like Al-Jubbā’ī, the head of Mu'tazilah, and I'm documenting information on Ibn Mujāshi‘ and his belief in "Faith is speech and action, increases and decreases" and "Quran is uncreated...".

Adding Key Figures

I'm now methodically processing more biographic details. I've documented information about figures like Al-Dārakī and Al-Madīnī, noting their death dates and trustworthiness evaluations. I'm also capturing details about Al-Wakī‘ī, Al-Bassāmī (the poet), Al-Bushtī, and Al-Bustī, specifying their names, death years, and other critical information. I'm taking care to clarify the distinction between Al-Bushtī and Al-Bustī based on their differing origins.

I'm also cataloging Al-Farhiyānī's expertise in Rijāl and noting his key narration. Finally, I'm noting the death dates and names of Al-Washshā’ and Abū Ma‘shar Al-Dārimī to clarify the historical context.

Detailing Biographical Profiles

I'm presently focused on refining biographical information, ensuring precise transcription and transliteration according to ALA-LC standards. I've updated the names, including Al-Dhahabī, and added critical details, such as the implications of "freedman/client" for Mawlá. My current task is to complete the biographies for key individuals, including their death dates and other pertinent information.

Revising Critical Translations

I'm now making refinements to critical translations. I've re-examined and updated key phrases in the source material to maintain accuracy. The focus is on ensuring precise rendering of complex terms. Specifically, I've rephrased "Possessor of spiritual states and unveiling" and ensured dates are precisely rendered, resolving inconsistencies. Also, I've corrected a potential inaccuracy regarding the date, ensuring consistency in the translated text.

I'm currently focused on the translation approach. Analyzing the source, Tahdhīb al-Kamāl, and aiming for clarity in Arabic-to-English. I'm prioritizing accuracy and readability, while also taking into account the nuances of Islamic biographical terminology. I'm evaluating the request to provide an effective translation.

Finalizing Style Parameters

I've solidified my approach to style. Precision is key; I lean toward literal translations unless the context screams for a meaning-based rendering, especially when it comes to the specialized terminology. I'm being meticulous in handling Jarh wa Ta'dīl terms and ensuring the IDs, ALA-LC codes, and full isnads remain intact in the translation. The use of "Allah" and ﷺ has been implemented.

Clarifying Format Adherence

I'm now zeroing in on the output format. While I've implemented my standard procedures, the user's specific instructions for "plain-text, no markdown or formatting" need strict adherence. I'll maintain IDs at the start of lines but won't include bolding, italics, or list formatting within the translation itself. This is a critical adjustment to meet their needs. I'm focusing on ALA-LC for transliteration and a rigorous three-pass review for accuracy. I've also noted to refrain from formatting chapter headings in uppercase.

Detailing Biographies Further

I'm now diving into the biographies of Ḥaḍramī and Ḍamḍam ibn 'Amr. I'm noting the narrations, criticisms, and opinions from key scholars, and have updated the notes. I'm focusing on their reliability and any discrepancies regarding their lineage. I'm diligently cross-referencing sources and recording the relevant biographical details.

Assessing Narrations & Scholars

I'm now focusing on ūsá ibn Ismāʻīl and Ḍamḍam Abū al-Muthanná al-Amlūkī. I'm carefully reviewing Abū Ḥātim's assessment of ūsá, and comparing Ibn Ḥibbān's assessment. I'm checking the hadith reported by Al-Bukhārī. For Ḍamḍam, I'm examining who narrated from him and to whom, along with any relevant scholarly opinions, including the wahm noted by Ibn Abī Ḥātim. I'm double-checking the names mentioned in the text.

Dissecting Hadith Details

I'm now focusing on the chains and the hadith text, particularly P6712. I've broken down the lengthy chain, noting the various narrators, including the different versions transmitted. I'm examining the hadith's core message regarding rulers delaying prayer, and the Prophet's ﷺ response. I'm analyzing the transmission paths from Abū Dāwūd and Ibn Mājah, as well as the variant with Jarīr's chain. I'm also comparing Sufyān's narration to those of Abū Zubayd and Shu‘bah to highlight and evaluate the differences. P6713 also needs attention as it appears to relate to a similar hadith.

I'm carefully reviewing the content of each hadith, including P6715's supplication, P6716's discussion on Qunut, and P6717's focus on monotheism. I'm paying attention to the chains of transmission, specifically the narrators and their methods.

Reviewing Hadith Transmissions

I'm now focusing on specific hadith, meticulously tracing their transmission chains. I've broken down P6718, noting its higher chain and identical content to P6717. I'm also examining the dream-related hadith, P6718a, paying attention to its chain and al-Shamā’il recording. The details of Ṭāriq ibn Abī al-Ḥasnā’ are now being documented.

Documenting Key Narrations

I'm now consolidating the information on Ṭāriq ibn Ziyād, documenting both P6720 and P6720a, and including the account in al-Qadar. I'm cataloging his narration from ‘Alī and the prophecy concerning the Khawārij. I'm also working on Ṭāriq ibn Suwayd, detailing his companionship and the dispute regarding his narration. I'm focusing on the differing accounts of his chain and content.

Compiling Hadith Details

I'm now deep into the hadith related to Ṭāriq. Specifically, I'm examining P6722, meticulously noting the chain from Ḥammād ibn Salamah to Ṭāriq, and the prohibition on wine. I'm also cataloging P6723 and its extensive biographical details. I've noted that Ṭāriq ibn Shihāb, while having seen the Prophet ﷺ, didn't directly hear from him. I'm carefully compiling his narrations from prominent figures and cross-referencing all related sources to ensure accuracy.

Analyzing Transmitters & Texts

I'm now deep into the biographical details and hadith chains. I'm carefully compiling information on Ṭāriq ibn 'Abd Allah al-Muharibi, focusing on his status as a companion.

I'm noting the critiques and endorsements by key authorities, and comparing the different viewpoints to determine his overall standing. I'm also carefully analyzing the chains of narration from the cited figures. The ongoing tasks involve scrutinizing the Isnads for authenticity and credibility.

Finalizing Hadith Entries

I'm now adding a new entry for Ṭāriq ibn 'Amr al-Umawī, including his role as a judge and details on the hadith he narrated. I'm also including P6731, the ‘Umrá hadith. I've compiled the necessary details on Ṭāriq ibn Mukhāshin, P6731a, and have started working on P6732, the Scorpion sting hadith.

Analyzing New Hadith

I'm presently focusing on Ṭālib ibn Ḥabīb and P6735, meticulously noting his narrated hadith and the associated scholars' evaluations. I'm carefully reviewing Abū Dāwūd's recording, as well as the biographical details of the figures in the chain. I'm also cross-referencing all sources to ensure accuracy.

Reviewing New Entries

I've re-checked the ALA-LC transliteration in order to check and confirm all the codes. My attention is now on verifying the accuracy of the final translation of each entry, including all the new translations. I'm double-checking the chains, paying close attention to any questionable wording.

I'm currently focused on the specific terminology in Jarḥ wa Taʿdīl. The challenge is accurately conveying the nuances of criticism and praise of narrators. I'm exploring different English equivalents to capture the spectrum of meanings while considering the potential for misunderstanding across cultural contexts. My working hypothesis involves building a glossary of key terms and their corresponding justifications.

Developing Translation Guidelines

I've been solidifying the translation guidelines, focusing on precision and consistency. I'm prioritizing literal translations unless the context necessitates a more meaning-based approach. Key instructions now encompass handling book codes, preserving isnaads, and managing transliteration for narrator names. I'm also addressing specific Arabic phrases and ensuring a plain text output without markdown. The first revision round has started, checking for markers, context, and transliteration correctness. My aim is to maintain the original intent while making the translation accessible.

Defining Terminology Nuances

I'm now honing in on the translation of "khashabīyan" within this Jarḥ. Initial research indicates it has multiple connotations, from "rough" or "wooden" to a sectarian slur linked to the Khashabiyyah. Given the imperative of literal accuracy and the potential for context-dependent interpretations, I'm leaning toward "a Khashabī" to capture the ambiguity and scholarly debate surrounding Shu'bah's usage. The decision is informed by an understanding that Shu'bah usually qualifies his statement.

Addressing Khashabī Context

I'm now focusing on the nuances of "khashabī" and related terms. Recognizing "khashabī" functions as both a descriptor and a sectarian term, I'll transliterate it. The context of Shu'bah's usage reveals his perspective on Hishām's approach. "Yatakhawwanuhā" translates best as "intentionally did". And, for context, I have clarified the specific meaning of "ṣāliḥ" as "acceptable in hadith".

Interpreting Narrator Evaluations

I'm now focusing on evaluating the narrators in this section. I'm prioritizing understanding phrases like "laa ba'sa bihi" and "thiqah." "Laa ba'sa bihi" indicates a narrator of moderate standing, while "thiqah" signifies trustworthiness. The context surrounding Hishām's weeping, humility and self-deprecation are significant, revealing his character and approach.

Clarifying Narrative Context

I'm presently focusing on the narrative context surrounding m b. Ḥizām, a Qurashī and Asadī. I've collected relevant biographical and textual data including his role as a Muslim of the Conquest, his tough and awe-inspiring character, and his practice of enjoining good. I'm noting his ascetic qualities and that he was martyred at Ajnādayn. Now, I am preparing for a translation of a specific ḥadīth attributed to him related to the punishment of the Nabateans regarding jizyah. The goal is to accurately translate key phrases.

Evaluating Narrators' Status

I'm now comparing and contrasting narrator evaluations within this section. Focusing on Hishām b. Khālid, known as al-Azraq, I've noted his biographical details including teachers and students, and his rank as ṣadūq. Meanwhile, Hishām b. Ziyād, also known as Abū al-Miqdām, receives strong criticism, being labelled ḍaʿīf, matrūk, and layla bi-shay’. I'm carefully reviewing these judgements, considering their context and possible implications. Also I'm noting the differing assessments of Hishām b. Zayd b. Anas.

Analyzing Narrator Discrepancies

I'm now diving into the discrepancies in evaluations of narrators, specifically focusing on d al-Madanī and Hishām b. Saʿīd al-Ṭāliqānī. I'm noting that while al-Madanī is criticized for a weak memory, he's also considered "acceptable" by some. Contrasting this, Hishām b. Saʿīd is deemed trustworthy but died before being widely heard from. I'm working to reconcile these differing perspectives within the broader context of Jarḥ wa Taʿdīl.

Revising Narrator Profiles

I'm now revising several narrator profiles based on Jarḥ wa Taʿdīl. I've corrected the Hishām b. Ṭalḥah error. I'm focusing on Hishām b. ʿĀmir's status as a Companion and the hadith attributed to him. I'm analyzing Hishām b. ʿĀ'idh, noting his trustworthiness. I am consolidating various narrators named Hishām, including Hishām b. Abī ʿAbd Allāh al-Dastuwā'ī, delving into his biography, teachers, and students. I'm noting Shu'bah's praise for his memory and sincerity in relation to Qatādah. I am consolidating and noting his rank, as well as considering details on each narrator.

Updating Narrator Biographies

I'm now consolidating information on various narrators with the name Hishām, comparing differing evaluations and biographical details. I'm noting the varying assessments of al-Yazanī's status, as well as the different ranks assigned to Hishām b. ʿAbd al-Malik al-Bāhilī. I'm focusing on his teachers and students, and noting Shu'bah's praise for Hishām b. Abī ʿAbd Allāh al-Dastuwā'ī, delving into his biography, teachers, and students. I'm noting Shu'bah's praise for his memory and sincerity in relation to Qatādah.

Clarifying Terminology Usage

I'm now zeroing in on defining munkar, muḍṭarib, and thabt. I'll apply these terms and those for place names. I'm focused on correct vocalization, verifying the differences between Ḥizām and Ḥazām. I am ensuring the correct place names are in use, e.g., al-Baṣrah. I'll translate mawla as "client" or "freedman". I'm also ensuring the plain text and IDs are correctly formatted. The current plan includes finalizing a simulated translation draft with attention to this precision.

Generating Hadith Indicators

I'm presently creating the translation output, beginning with hadith indicators. I'm translating "akhbaranā" as "narrated to us" and "samiʿtu" as "I heard." The next step is to accurately represent the isnaad and transliteration of names. I'm ensuring all information is correctly formatted, with an emphasis on accuracy and clarity for the reader. I am including the hadith codes, too.

Verifying Narrator References

I'm now focusing on verifying the numerous narrator references and phrases used in the section. I've double-checked the meanings of phrases, such as "La wa la" and confirmed the translation of "Makatha abī" as "My father remained/lived." I'm ensuring all isnaads are accurate and transliterated consistently, and confirming all place names. I'm also ensuring the correct names of narrators and their links are used, correcting any errors.

Standardizing Hadith Translations

I'm now focusing on standardizing the hadith translations and ensuring consistent terminology. I'm verifying the formatting of hadith codes and headings. I'm prioritizing accuracy in the transliteration of names and correcting any errors. My current aim is to achieve a precise and readable translation of key phrases, including the correct usage of "Allah" and "ﷺ". I'm implementing self-corrections as needed.

Implementing Final Adjustments

I'm now implementing the latest corrections, focusing on accuracy and clarity. I've integrated the self-corrections, including clarifying "Lam akhram minhā" and refining translations for terms like "Yatamalmal" and "Istushhida bi-Ajnādayn." I've also revised specific names and phrases, ensuring consistent transliteration and proper contextual interpretation.

I'm now grappling with the tricky points in the footnotes. I've successfully incorporated the specifics from the latest notes. I'm focusing on "Mursal," "Tābi‘ī Mukhaḍram," "Majhūl," and "Munqaṭi‘" evaluations. I'm also ensuring the correct transliteration of "al-Sha'rā'" and "admaghathum," and the accurate handling of the title "Kisrā." Finally, I'm verifying the proper approach to Quranic verse citations, in line with the instructions.

Performing Final Edits

I'm making final refinements to the translations, meticulously reviewing the output against instructions. I'm verifying the numbered sequences and ensuring proper transliterations of names. Adjustments include fixing 'Al-Ajalh' to 'Al-Ajlaḥ,' updating 'Zirr' to 'Zirr ibn Ḥubaysh,' and correcting title and terminology inconsistencies. I've double-checked the F-number sequence is correct.

Validating the Formatting

I'm now fully immersed in the final phases. I'm ensuring all the output looks like plain text, with meticulous checks for Arabic script removal, except for ﷺ. Preserving the integrity of IDs remains a priority. I'm also addressing internal consistency issues with transliterations and titles. During drafting, I encountered a discrepancy, which I've clarified—the manuscript variation "Al-Aḥlaj" does appear to be supported in the footnote as "Al-Ajlaḥ ṣadūq." Furthermore, I've clarified that the Quran verse translation must be included in context. Finally, I've corrected the title, and the book name reference from the original notes, which reads: "ibn Abī ‘Āṣim in al-Āḥād."

I've been meticulously analyzing the user's request, focusing on the specific role needed: an Arabic-to-English translator with expertise in Islamic content. I'm starting to identify the key nuances and potential challenges to ensure accurate and appropriate translations. I'm moving toward assessing the need for specific tools or resources.

Define Translation Protocol

I've established a detailed translation protocol for the al-Sunan al-Kubrá text. I am focusing on literal accuracy, unless context necessitates a meaning-based approach. The rules dictate ALA-LC transliteration and precise Islamic terminology, paying careful attention to specific phrases like "حَدَّثَنَا مُحَمَّدُ" and "صلى الله عليه وسلم". No Arabic characters other than "ﷺ" are permitted in the output, which will be plain text, with no markdown. I will be sure to keep the IDs and not touch the numeric prefixes. I will revise each segment twice before final output.

Delving Deeper into Context

I am now focusing on the nuances of specific segments. I am analyzing the differences in narrations on fasting and cupping (T1450-T1468) and the behavior of the fasting person (T1469-T1475). Words like qawl al-zūr, ghībah, and rafath are coming under scrutiny. Al-Wiṣāl (continuous fasting) is also the focus, in T1476. I will keep track of all of these concepts.

Analyzing New Concepts

I'm now diving into fresh segments focusing on al-Wiṣāl and related themes. The concept of "The prohibition of Al-Wiṣāl is a mercy" is particularly interesting. I'm also examining fast-breaking scenarios, considering segments on eating in presence of the fasting, or during forgetfulness. I'm also looking into concepts like making fast permissible, voluntary fasting, hastening iftar, the reward of providing iftar, and the sections on I'tikaf and Laylat al-Qadr with focus on terminology like mustaḥāḍah, qubbah, khaṭmī.

Evaluating More Segments

I'm now deeply immersed in the nuances of new segments. I'm focusing on "Qadr in the nine, the seven, and the five" and "īmānan wa-iḥtisāban". I'm also examining the "Book of Al-Muḥārabah" with terms like muthlah, ybaqu, and the ruling on reviling the Prophet. Segments on siḥr, maẓlamatih, and rāyah ʿammiyyah are also being thoroughly reviewed. In the Hajj segments, terms like mabrūr and lā yastamsiku ʿalá al-raḥl are also under analysis.

Identifying Precise Terminology

I'm now zeroing in on a series of specialized terms and phrases. The focus includes examining taʿrīs, muṣabbaghah, wars, zaʿfarān, ifrad, qiran, tamattuʿ, ishʿār, salt al-dam, ḥijāmah, inshād al-shiʿr, al-ḥijr, miḥjan, ramal, and ghuduww. I am carefully evaluating the context of each term within the segments to ensure precise translation. I'm also addressing the "l3" issue with the ID.

Resolving Ambiguities

I've been analyzing the text containing "l3" and have decided to treat it as noise, given the context. I'll translate the Arabic text that follows directly, preserving the ID "T1758". I am now focusing on T1772, translating īḍāʿ, which means "hurting."

Analyzing Fresh Sections

I'm now immersing myself in segments focused on Hajj and Jihad. Key terms like jamrat al-ʿaqabah, ḥillāq, and zāḥafat demand meticulous interpretation. The concept of inākhah is also critical. I'm moving on to exploring the Jihad section, looking at terms such as sariyyah, ʿiqāl, and fawāq nāqah. The intricacies of murābiṭ are also being analyzed. I'm progressing to segments on horses. I'm focusing on shiyah, and the details of shikāl.

Exploring Recent Sections

I'm now deeply immersed in the nuances of fresh segments related to horses, khums, and sacrifices. I'm carefully analyzing the terms like jalab, janab, the division of khums, and the details of sacrificial animals. The characteristics of these animals like ʿawrāʾ, ʿarjāʾ, ʿajfāʾ, are under intense scrutiny. I'm now also understanding concepts on dhakāt, mutaraddiyah, and jallālah. I'm also preparing to focus on aqīqah.

Examining Diverse Concepts

I'm now fully immersed in diverse segments, starting with aqīqah and moving onto faraʿ, ʿatīrah, and maytah. I'm also analyzing sharecropping (muzāraʿah), examining mufāwaḍah and ʿasb al-faḥl. Moving on, I'm now examining oaths with a focus on terms like ṭawāghīt, kaffārah, and laghw. I am working on the vows section, and I am about to engage with the hunting segments, getting ready for concepts like al-insāʿ.

Delving into New Domains

I am now thoroughly engaged with the latest sections. I'm focusing on "The Book of Hunting" and examining terms such as miʿrāḍ, maytat al-baḥr, and iyyah tastawḥish. I'm also now analyzing the "Book of Manumission" (T2094-T2124). Key terms such as tadbir, mukātab, and umm al-walad demand careful interpretation. I'm proceeding to the "Book of Drinks" (T2125-T2186). Words like anṣāb, azlām, busr, nabīdh al-khalīṭayn, and zahw are being analyzed meticulously, as are phrases in the Quran.

Analyzing Additional Segments

I'm now deeply immersed in the nuances of beer, wine, and marriage segments. Key terms and phrases like jiʿah, jarr, dubbāʾ, and ḥantam are under analysis, as are more complex concepts such as tabattul, ghayrāʾ, and shighār. I am translating the Hadd Punishment for Wine section with care.

Defining Further Terms

I'm now focusing on a series of divorce-related concepts and terms. I'm carefully translating "al-muṭallaqah thalāthan", "muḥill", and "mutʿah". I'm also delving into "taḥillat al-khalwah", and phrases related to lineage and bed ownership. I'm proceeding through the divorce segments, examining key phrases like "ṭalāq al-sunnah", "al-battah", and the nuanced meanings of "ilḥaqī bi-ahlik."

Reviewing Specific Details

I am now meticulously focusing on specific names and Quranic verses, updating the translation protocol with new nuances. I'm verifying the transliteration of key figures, and handling complex verses, ensuring accuracy and adherence to the guidelines. I am moving towards long commentaries from al-Nasa'i, and a long commentary on the prohibition of wine.

Verifying Complex Segments

I'm now focusing on critical verses and specific terms like yuḥāribūn (wage war against) and yasʿawn fī al-arḍ fasādan (strive upon the earth [to cause] corruption). I'm also delving into detailed descriptions like those found in T1918 (Shikāl), ensuring accurate grammatical interpretation of the Arabic, including the nuances of shikāl itself. Additionally, the translation of Quranic verses in T2126 remains a focus.

Verifying Output Formatting

I'm diligently working on ensuring the output will be plain text, checking for uppercase chapter headings, and focusing on proper handling of Quranic verses, as per the established guidelines. I've corrected and verified several segments, including T1457, T1483, T1558, and T1933, to ensure they meet requirements. I'm focusing on key terms, such as ghanimtum and li-dhī al-qurbá, in T1933. I am now proceeding to T2126 and similar verses to check for accuracy.

I've begun by meticulously analyzing the task at hand. The primary focus is on the specific role – a professional translator adept at Islamic content, particularly specializing in al-Sunan al-Kubrá by al-Nasāʾī. This crucial step informs the entire approach, ensuring accuracy and cultural sensitivity. The source material will be the chapter titles.

Developing the Translation Strategy

I'm now fully immersed in the translation process, establishing concrete rules. I've prioritized accuracy, especially in technical Islamic terms, and am using ALA-LC for proper names. "God" is exclusively "Allah", except for generic references. The transliteration is now streamlined, and I'm ensuring no Arabic characters appear outside of ﷺ. I have also established a clear revision process in two phases.

Formulating Translation of Isti'atha

I'm now grappling with the nuanced translation of "Isti'atha," focusing on the various forms of seeking refuge described. Each title presents a unique challenge, requiring careful consideration of the specific evil being sought refuge from and the most appropriate English phrasing. I'm aiming for clarity and precision while maintaining the gravity and spiritual significance of the Arabic terms, balancing literalness with idiomatic English.

Refining Financial Hardship

I'm now diving into the complexities of seeking refuge from financial and spiritual trials.

Disbelief, misguidance, and the nuances of oppression have also received intense scrutiny. I'm prioritizing accuracy in each title and considering the balance between literal and idiomatic translation.

Analyzing Titles for Nuance

I've been analyzing the subtle variations in these titles, specifically the distinctions between acting unjustly and being treated unjustly. I'm leaning towards "from committing oppression" and "from being oppressed" to maintain the literal essence. Each title presents a unique challenge, from facing enemies to the sting of malicious joy, the decline of age, and the weight of fate and misfortune. I'm focusing on capturing the precise intent of each title.

Exploring Deeper Nuances

I'm now wrestling with the nuances of seeking refuge from a range of negative conditions. Titles about madness, the evil eye of the Jinn, decrepitude, and the vilest stage of life demand careful phrasing. I'm also grappling with the concept of deficiency after abundance and what constitutes an "evil sight" concerning family and wealth. Finally, I'm focusing on seeking refuge from the oppressed's supplication.

Expanding Refuge Scope

I'm now expanding my considerations to a new set of titles. I'm focusing on "gloomy return," "evil neighbor," and the "overpowering of men," ensuring I capture their essence with precision. The Dajjal's trial and the devils among mankind also present complex linguistic challenges. Finally, I'm examining seeking refuge from the trials of life, death, and the punishment of the grave. Each title demands careful wording.

Expanding Refuge Focus

I'm now working to translate these final titles, covering trials like the cessation of blessings and various punishments, including those of Allah, Hell, and the Fire. I'm carefully considering how to render "evil" in "what one has done," acknowledging the subtle difference in phrasing in the two final titles, and noting the scholarly disagreements. I'm focusing on consistency in terminology.

Analyzing New Chapters

My focus has shifted to the final chapters. I'm translating titles such as "seeking refuge from the evil of what I haven't done," "being swallowed by the earth," and "falling from heights." I'm carefully considering the implications of "wrath," the "Day of Resurrection's narrowness," and the nuances of the Qur'an's virtues, revelation, and the many gates from which it descended. I need to capture the richness of the source material.

Exploring Qur'anic Revelation

I've been meticulously translating the final set of chapter titles. I'm carefully considering nuances like the different modes the Qur'an was revealed in, the role of Jibrīl in reviewing it, and the scribes and reciters.

The textual focus is on Aisha's role in making a mat for the Prophet and the subsequent gathering of people. I'm noting the Prophet's reaction, his guidance about burden, and the referenced verse from Al-Muzzammil. The details of their prolonged night vigil and Allah's eventual mercy are being considered.

Revising Narrative Details

I am now focusing on refining the narrative details, particularly the circumstances surrounding the revelation of Al-Muzzammil. The story remains the same but now I am trying to resolve how it became an obligation. I am considering the Prophet's reaction to the burden placed on his followers. Two new chains from Ibn Abbas and the chain from Ibn Humayd, are under review, offering crucial insights into the duration of this state, which was 10 years, and the specific verse that lightened the obligation, 'Alima an sayakūnu minkum marḍā...

Contrasting Interpretations Assessed

I'm now examining several conflicting interpretations. I'm focusing on the duration of the obligation to stand at night. Qatadah and Abū ‘Abd al-Raḥmān's narratives suggest a year, leading to physical discomfort. Al-Hasan's comments highlight the shift from obligation to voluntary action, a crucial point I'm now integrating into my translation. The narrative details highlight a key contrast I have to consider.

Reciting Surah Insights

I'm now integrating insights on the interpretation of "wa rattil al-qur'āna tartīlā". I've reviewed narrations from Ibn Abbas via Ikrimah, and several definitions of Tartīl from Al-Hasan, Mujāhid, and Qatādah. I'm focusing on the implications of a year passing between the beginning and the end of the Surah. Also I am analyzing how different scholars interpreted the meaning of tartīl, including the concepts of clear, distinct, slow, deliberate and elongating recitation.

Examining Heavy Concepts

I'm currently delving into the concept of "heavy" words (qawlan thaqīlā), comparing various interpretations. I have just concluded analyzing the narrations and viewpoints regarding the weight of the word. I am reviewing the interpretations, ranging from the heaviness of acting upon the words to the physical burden of the revelation itself. I'm also examining Ibn Zayd's view and Tabari's conclusion about both meanings applying.

Clarifying Prayer Timing

I'm now examining differing interpretations of when night prayer begins, focusing on narrations from Ibn Abbas, Mujahid, and Ibn Zayd, all supporting different starting times. I'm noting the Arabic term nasha'a, and how it relates to standing up. The contrast with Abu Mijlaz, Qatadah, and Al-Hasan's views, which place the prayer after 'Isha', are under examination.

Exploring Verse Meanings

I'm now diving into the nuances of verse meanings. Recent analysis focuses on the term Wiṭā'an, examining narrations provided by Ibn Abbas and Ibn Zayd. Additionally, I am looking at Mujāhid's interpretation. I am analyzing the verse Aqwamu qīlā, its various narrations, and its different meanings, including aṣwabu qīlā, and ahya’. I'm also now reviewing the meaning of Sabḥan ṭawīlā in relation to the day.

Deciphering Key Terminology

I'm now focusing on the varied interpretations of "Sabḥan ṭawīlā" within Surah Al-Muzzammil, specifically examining how it's defined and understood. Ibn Abbas, Mujāhid, Qatādah, and Ibn Zayd's perspectives on the term "Sabḥan" have captured my attention, offering insights into sleep, long enjoyment, leisure, and needs. I'm also delving into Yahya ibn Ya'mar's reading variance, Sabkhā, which Tabari interprets as expansion or ease. "Tabattal" is another key term I'm considering, noting its meaning as devotion, cutting oneself off for worship, and its etymological connection to Maryam as Batūl. I'm also analyzing narrations from Ibn Abbas, Mujāhid, Al-Hasan, and Qatādah on the meaning of Tabattal

Summarizing Verse Meanings

I am currently focusing on refining the interpretations of key verses, particularly those related to divine attributes and actions. I've been reviewing the verse Rabbu l-mashriqi wa-l-maghrib ("Lord of the east and the west"), noting the nuances of the recitation of Rabbu versus Rabbi. I am also considering Lā ilāha illā hū (No god but He) and Wakīlā (Disposer of affairs). The verse Wahjurhum hajran jamīlā ("Avoid them with a beautiful avoidance") is also under my lens, with consideration given to the interpretations of patience and abrogation. Furthermore, the context of Dharnī wal-mukadhdhibīn ("Leave Me and the deniers"), and the implications of this verses' context with the Battle of Badr are being explored with additional sources from Qatadah.

Examining Punishments Defined

I'm now detailing the punishments described, starting with "Ankāl," which is understood as fetters or shackles according to narrations from Ikrimah, Mujahid, Hammad, Qatadah, and Al-Hasan. I'm noting the descriptions of "Jaḥīmā" as Hellfire and "Ṭa‘āman dhā ghuṣṣah" as food that chokes, referencing Ibn Abbas and Mujahid's narrations. I am now exploring the painful punishment, ‘Adhāban alīmā, and a narration of the Prophet's ﷺ experience when reciting these verses.

Comparing Thematic Punishments

The current focus is on exploring the thematic details of punishments within the passage. I am examining Akhdhan wabīlā, its meaning as a severe or heavy seizure, and analyzing the interpretations from Ibn Abbas, Mujāhid, Qatadah, and Ibn Zayd. I'm noting the implications of Yawman yaj‘alu al-wildāna shībā ("A day that makes children gray-haired") and how this relates to disbelief and fear. Also, I am taking into account Ibn Mas'ud's narration regarding the greying of children. Currently I am noting that Ibn Zayd ascribes the grey hair to distress.

Interpreting Verse Meanings

I'm now focusing on the varied interpretations of the verses describing the heavens splitting (munfaṭir). I've reviewed narrations from Ibn Abbas, who associates the split with the descent of the Most Merciful, and Mujahid, Al-Hasan, and Ikrimah, who connect it to being heavily burdened or cracked. The goal now is to refine the phrasing to accurately capture the specific sense of the splitting apart.

Delineating Contextual Details

I'm now focusing on the nuances of the context. I'm taking into account Tabattal, Ankāl, Kathīb mahīl, and Wabīl. Tabattal describes a devotion, and is connected with the etymological root of Maryam (as the Batūl). Ankāl means fetters, and Kathīb mahīl represents a pouring sand dune. Finally, I'm examining Wabīl, as a term representing something pernicious. I am also checking my markers, and currently have made it to P15708c.

Tracing the Narrative Threads

I'm presently tracing the narrative across several pages, cross-referencing markers, particularly between P15708d through P15725. I'm focusing on their relationships to one another. I am also making note of the order of the source material. I'm ensuring all elements align contextually with the ongoing translation.

Revising Narrative Details

I am now focusing on refining the narrative details, specifically the circumstances surrounding the revelation of Al-Muzzammil. The story remains the same but now I am trying to resolve how it became an obligation. I am considering the Prophet's reaction to the burden placed on his followers. Two new chains from Ibn Abbas and the chain from Ibn Humayd, are under review, offering crucial insights into the duration of this state, which was 10 years, and the specific verse that lightened the obligation, 'Alima an sayakūnu minkum marḍā...

Detailing Final Draft Adjustments

I'm now focusing on the final adjustments, ensuring all Arabic text, except ﷺ, is rendered into English. I'm verifying the consistent use of "God" versus "Allah" throughout. Formatting is being meticulously checked, with a focus on plain text and ID markers at the start. I've re-examined the poetic verse, confirming the clarity of sabā'ikh in relation to sabḥan and sabkhan. Grammatical nuances have been incorporated, distinguishing Wiṭā'an from Waṭ'an. Finally, I'm ensuring the correct meaning of ma‘yūn is conveyed within the poem's context, clarifying the pattern of maf‘ūl.

I'm currently honing my translation strategy. Analyzing the request, I've identified key elements: my role as a specialist, the source text being Tafsīr al-Ṭabarī, and the target language, English. I'm focusing on preserving nuances while ensuring clarity for English readers. I aim to create a culturally sensitive and accurate translation, reflecting my expertise.

Establishing Technical Accuracy

I'm now implementing the technical constraints. Accuracy is paramount; I'm prioritizing literal translations unless context necessitates a meaning-based shift. I'm paying close attention to Islamic terminology, ensuring precision, and diligently preserving the full isnād chains. I'm using ALA-LC for transliterations and will translate "God" as "Allah" where appropriate, while صلى الله عليه وسلم will be rendered as ﷺ. No Arabic characters will appear in the output, and I'll adhere to plain text formatting. Finally, I'm committed to thorough revisions to guarantee accuracy and compliance with these strict formatting rules.

Examining the Narrative

I'm presently dissecting the narrative from Tafsīr al-Ṭabarī concerning Surah Nuh, verse 23. Focusing on the idols Wadd, Suwā‘, Yaghūth, Ya‘ūq, and Nasr, I'm working on a clear English rendering of the isnād chain and the story's core points: righteous men, the creation of statues, and the shift to idolatry. The historical context, including the role of Iblīs, is taking shape, and I'm ensuring faithful translation of key terms.

Clarifying the Idolatry

I'm presently working to elucidate the narrative regarding the idols. I've received a new narration with the isnād chain of Ibn Ḥumayd -> Mihrān -> Sufyān -> his father -> ‘Ikrimah. This narration offers two significant interpretations. Firstly, it states that ten generations existed between Adam and Noah, all following Islam. Secondly, it suggests the idols' names were associated with Noah's people. I'm carefully determining how to convey this dual perspective clearly. I am now trying to draft a clear translation with appropriate attribution and ensuring the proper context is maintained.

Expanding the Scope

I'm now integrating another narration from Qatādah. It details how the idols mentioned were associated with specific Arab tribes after Noah's people. I'm focusing on accurately translating the tribal affiliations: Wadd with Kalb, Suwā‘ with Hudhayl, Yaghūth with Murād, Ya‘ūq with Hamdān, and Nasr with Ḥimyar. The core concept is that these idols initially belonged to Noah's people but later were adopted by the Arabs. I'm trying to represent how the physical descriptions of the idols, being merely wood, clay, or stone, is relevant to the narrative.

Defining the Material Nature

I'm presently focusing on how to represent the physical attributes of the idols in my translation. The text repeatedly emphasizes their mundane materiality—a mere piece of wood, clay, or stone. I'm exploring various ways to convey this, ensuring the reader understands the contrast between their nature and the reverence they later received. I'm trying to capture the descriptive details while maintaining the narrative flow.

Incorporating New Narration

I'm now integrating another narration, sourced from Al-Ḥusayn -> Abū Mu‘ādh -> ‘Ubayd -> Al-Ḍaḥḥāk. This narration identifies the idols Wadd, Suwā‘, Yaghūth, Ya‘ūq, and Nasr as gods worshipped in Noah's time, specifically mentioning their presence in Yemen. I'm focusing on the precise wording to convey this clearly.

Verifying Recitations' Accuracy

I'm now focusing on the varied recitations of "Waddan." My latest update involves a narration through Yūnus, Ibn Wahb, and Ibn Zayd, stating the idols were their gods. Importantly, the recitations of "Waddan" have diverged: Medina reads "Wuddan" (with a damma), while Kufa and Basra read "Waddan" (with a fatha). My task is now to verify these readings accurately as two valid options, allowing flexibility for the reader's preferred pronunciation. I'm focusing on ensuring accuracy in my English rendering, conveying the interpretive nuances.

Reflecting on Misguidance

My current focus is on the interpretation of "And they have misled many" and "And do not increase the wrongdoers except in error." Noah attributes misguidance directly to the idols, seeing the worship itself as the cause of deviation. I'm exploring how to best convey the concept that idolatry seals hearts, preventing them from accessing truth. My draft attempts to clarify the causal link between worship and error, reflecting the text's understanding of this spiritual dynamic.

Analyzing Linguistic Nuance

I'm currently engaged in analyzing the nuances of verse 25 and 26 from Surah Nuh. I'm focusing specifically on interpreting the connector "mā" within "mimmā khaṭī'ātihim." This "mā" emphasizes their sins as the direct cause of their drowning. I'm drawing comparisons to similar constructions in Arabic, like "aynamā," to sharpen the explanation, and the structure should reflect this emphasis.

Unpacking Sinful Drowning

I'm now focusing on the nuances surrounding "Mimmā khaṭī'ātihim." Ibn Zayd's perspective emphasizes that their sins directly caused their drowning and subsequent damnation. I'm exploring how the "bā" in this context acts as a separator in Arabic, strengthening the causal link between sin and fate. The draft will clarify this direct consequence while reflecting the varying recitations of khaṭī'ātihim versus khaṭāyāhum.

Expanding Interpretations

My current focus is expanding my understanding of the passage. I'm now addressing verse 26 from Surah Nuh. I'm focusing on "the disbelievers an inhabitant." The term dayyār is derived from dawarān, meaning movement. I'm working on how this nuance will be conveyed in the translation, to represent a sense of displacement or transient existence. I'm now drafting a clear and precise translation that captures the full semantic range of the term.

Exploring Root Meanings

I'm presently examining the linguistic roots of dayyār and its implications in Surah Nuh. I've uncovered the connection to "rotation" (dawarān), signifying perpetual movement. The root's presence in the draft has allowed me to grasp the sense of displacement. I'm focusing on translating this nuanced term to portray a sense of transience. The goal is to represent the meaning, which can be seen in the following verses [Nuh 27-28].

Summarizing Noah's Supplication

I'm now integrating the context of Noah's supplication, prompted by the divine revelation that no more would believe. I'm focusing on the draft reflecting this crucial temporal setting and interpreting the meaning accurately. The translation seeks to clarify the link between Noah's knowledge of this revelation and the shift in his plea.

Synthesizing Diverse Prayers

I'm now integrating the translation of Noah's specific and general duas, as triggered by divine revelation. I've received a related narration through Ibn ‘Abd al-A‘lā, Ibn Thawr, and Ma‘mar, solidifying the context. This narrative clearly shows Noah's shift from a specific plea to a broader supplication, capturing the transition from personal grief to a more inclusive prayer. My draft will now reflect this development and accurately render the full content.

Revising Contextual Clarity

I'm now revising my translation to integrate additional context from Qatādah regarding Noah's supplication. I'm clarifying the interpretation of specific phrases, particularly the meaning of "my house" in relation to the mosque/place of prayer. I'm focusing on ensuring this new element seamlessly fits the narrative and preserves the original intention, while upholding clarity.

Defining Ruinous Deviancy

I'm now focusing on the term tabārā, which means ruin or loss, as detailed in verse 28 of Surah Nuh. Al-Ḍaḥḥāk and others define this term, emphasizing a destructive ending. I'm exploring various ways to represent this concept and ensure the reader understands the severity of the consequence of deviation, while accurately presenting the draft. I'm trying to capture the emotional weight and spiritual impact of tabārā.

Analyzing Terminology Precision

I'm presently revising the translation of "tabārā," which translates to "destruction." My goal is to translate and explain the term with precision. I'm building on Al-Ḍaḥḥāk and other interpreters' perspectives. I'm now integrating Mujāhid's interpretation of tabārā as "loss." The goal is to create a complete and cohesive explanation.

Contextualizing Surah Al-Jinn

I'm now integrating the transition to Surah Al-Jinn, starting with verses 1-3. The draft includes the narration from Mujahid where Noah's resilience and forgiveness are emphasized. I'm focusing on the structural shift, noting that the draft will begin with, "Ibn ‘Abd al-A‘lā narrated to us, he said: Ibn Thawr narrated to us, he said: Ma‘mar said: Al-A‘mash narrated to us, from Mujāhid, he said: They used to beat Noah until he fainted, so when he recovered, he said: My Lord, forgive my people, for they do not know. End of the interpretation of Surah "Nuh" ﷺ." and then transition to, "The discussion regarding the interpretation of the saying of the Exalted: (Say, "It has been revealed to me that a group of the jinn listened and said, 'Indeed, we have heard an amazing Qur'an [1] It guides to the right course, and we have believed in it. And we will never associate with our Lord...'"

This experience prompts their return to their people, leading to their conversion and the subsequent revelation to the Prophet. The emphasis is on capturing the narrative's structure and the jinn's transformative experience.

Outlining Jinn's Visit

I am now focusing on the first group of Jinn to investigate the new message. The draft includes the narration from Zirr, who highlights the clan of Zawba‘ah's visit to Mecca, confirming the account from Surah Al-Ahqaf. Additionally, a separate narration details the heavenly block, with the emergence of the Jinn from Nasibin to survey the land. I will be incorporating the narrative of Iblis's inquiry from this second narration.

I'm prioritizing the supporting evidence from the Prophet (Marfūʻ) and Allah's promise, as reflected in the phrase "I am sending it." Understanding the precise nature of the contents isn't as critical as confirming its actual descent. The source text analysis is complete, with a focus on Tabari's commentary.

Verifying Tabari's Commentary

I'm now fully engaged with Tabari's explicit assertions. His firm stance on the heavenly table's descent is clear. He reinforces this with prophetic evidence and Allah's unwavering promise. I'm focusing on his textual arguments, verifying that the actual descent occurred.

Reconciling Heavenly Table Details

I'm now fully immersed in the segment where the table's contents are central. My focus is on synthesizing the differing interpretations: Was it bread and fish, or paradise fruits? Tabari's stance on the general food is paramount. While specifics are secondary, the threat of divine punishment to those who disbelieved after witnessing the table remains the key translation focus.

Examining Divine Punishment

I'm now fully immersed in the details of divine punishment following the heavenly table's descent. The focus is on the transformation into pigs and monkeys, and Tabari's stance on this consequence. I'm focusing on the isnād chains, particularly from Qatadah. The punishment's connection to disbelief and rejection of Jesus is critical. The segment explores how to accurately convey Tabari's Tafsir.

Refining Divine Punishment

I'm now comparing two related isnād chains for Tabari's Tafsir. The focus is on the same content: the harshest punishments.

Clarifying Translation Terminology

I've been working on refining the translation terms, incorporating "Pure Spirit" for Rūḥ al-Qudus. Considering Mā'idah as 'table' and Khawāriyyūn as 'disciples' is key. I'm checking the rajaz verse, particularly shatat and Hammālah. Also, I am clarifying the distinction between siḥr and sāḥir to avoid confusion. Now I'm carefully reviewing all transliterations.

Standardizing Isnad Transliterations

I'm now methodically reviewing and standardizing the transliteration of all isnād names within the segments, ensuring consistency and accuracy across the entire translation. This includes double-checking the spellings and diacritics for all the narrators, such as Ḥassān ibn Mukhāriq, ʻAlī ibn Abī Ṭalḥah, and Saʻīd ibn Jubayr, to achieve a unified style, focusing on clarity and correctness.

Revising Linguistic Nuances

I'm now revising the translation to address previous comments on the linguistic aspects. I am now working on ensuring that transliterations are formatted in a consistent manner.

I'm now zeroing in on the request, digging into the intricacies of the source text, Tafsīr al-Ṭabarī. My aim is a translation that's both professionally sound and true to the original's essence, considering the English target.

Establishing Translation Parameters

I've established the translation guidelines, focusing on literal accuracy while considering context. Specifically, I'll retain full isnads using ALA-LC for narrator names, translate "God" as "Allah", and use "ﷺ" for ṣallā Allāhu ʿalayhi wa-sallam. The output will be plain text with segment IDs at the beginning, avoiding any formatting or Arabic characters in the response. I've set up a four-pass review system to ensure quality: structure, context, transliteration, and no Arabic text. I'm now processing the first segment, P5887, starting with the isnad.

Detailing the Narrative

I'm currently delving into the specifics of the segment. The isnad points to Sa'id ibn Jubayr's account of the Negus's envoys and their interaction with the Prophet. I've noted the verses cited, including Yā Sīn and related passages. Al-Tabari's commentary is particularly insightful, contrasting the Christians' devotion with the Jews' actions. I've also identified key terms like qissisin and ruhbān to inform the translation's nuances. Now, I am exploring P5888a with its reference to tears of recognition.

Interpreting the Response

I've just considered the Negus's emissaries and their reaction to the Quran. The text indicates their recognition of its divine origin, prompting tears. I'm noting the varying isnads from different narrators, each offering corroborating viewpoints on the passage's revelation concerning the Negus. The specifics of the groups, whether seven monks and five priests or the inverse, remain a point of consideration for accurate translation.

Examining the Commentary

I'm now delving into the commentary for P5890 and P5890a, beginning with the various narrations concerning the Negus and his companions' response to the Quran. The focus is on their declaration of faith, as indicated by the grammar of yaqūlūn. The verses 5:82-83 and 25:63 are central. I've noted the multiple isnads cited for P5890a, emphasizing the verse "So write us down among the witnesses", which is interpreted as a request to be counted with the Muslim community. Finally, I'm commencing examination of the commentary on P5890b.

Connecting the Concepts

I'm now analyzing the interpretations of "witnesses," focusing on their relationship to the Prophet Muhammad and his Ummah. I've noted the differing perspectives on what constitutes witnessing and how it relates to the Quranic verses cited. I've just started to look into the interpretations.

Defining Key Terms

I'm now clarifying the term "Righteous People" in verse 5:84, interpreting it as the Prophet and his companions. I've also noted the identification of the individuals who made this statement. Currently, I'm examining the reward for their actions, specifically, the concept of Jannāt as gardens with rivers and the meaning of Khālidīn and Muḥsinīn in relation to eternal dwelling and those who do good deeds. The commentary now turns to those who denied Allah's oneness and Muhammad's prophethood.

Unpacking the Narrations

I'm now deep into the commentary on verse 5:87, exploring the prohibition of excesses in religious practice. I've just uncovered the context: the verse addresses believers, rebuking those who impose strict restrictions on themselves, like prohibiting good food or avoiding women, akin to the practices of priests and monks. The various narrations around the Asbab al-Nuzul are rich with detail, featuring individuals like ‘Uthmān ibn Maẓ‘ūn, and ‘Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib. Their attempts to castrate themselves, abstain from food and marriage, and take to wandering the earth, have all been noted, and the Prophet's response is the key: a firm rejection of such asceticism. The Prophet's own actions and words – eating, sleeping, marrying – serve as the benchmark for a balanced approach to faith, clearly demonstrating that a rejection of the Sunnah is not indicative of true faith. I've now begun to dig into the story of Al-Ḥawlā’ and her complaint to ‘Ā’ishah.

Interpreting Verses

I'm now diving into the commentary on verse 5:89, which addresses oaths, specifically those that might involve prohibiting lawful things. I'm focusing on the linguistic nuances, particularly the difference between ‘Aqqadtum and ‘Aqadtum. Tabari seems to lean toward ‘Aqadtum, which implies a singular act of intention rather than repeated action. I'm also considering the context: the verse is speaking to people who may have unjustly prohibited certain good things through their oaths. The emphasis is on understanding that breaking such oaths necessitates atonement.

Deciphering Intent

I'm now examining the various interpretations of oaths, specifically differentiating between unintentional slips of the tongue and deliberate, binding oaths. I'm focusing on the term "Laghw" and how it's distinct from oaths that require expiation, drawing on narrations from Mujāhid and Al-Ḥasan for clarity. The discussions around the pronoun hu and whether it refers to the intent or the oath itself present nuanced linguistic points. I'm also contrasting the varying perspectives on Laghw and intentional oaths, considering the potential interpretations from Ibn Mas‘ūd and Hanafis. Currently, I am analyzing different definitions of Laghw from the narrations.

Delineating Interpretations

I've just finished analyzing the opposing views on "Laghw" and intentional oaths, with a particular focus on Tabari's support for the unintentional aspect of Laghw, and Al-Suddī's perspective regarding expiation. I've delved into P5908-P5909a, where another interpretation posits "Laghw" as an oath to do harm. The concept of "average" family sustenance is next up in C2757, defined as the most just and moderate standard food. Lastly, I'm verifying the presence of all IDs in the first pass of the translation, to ensure a solid foundation.

Expanding the Analysis

I'm now deep into the commentary for P5909a, focusing on the discussion of expiation. I've noted that C2757 introduces the concept of an "average" family's sustenance, which is described as the most just and moderate standard food. I am also reviewing the second pass terminology, making sure that I am being consistent. Lastly, I am verifying that all segments are present and accounted for.

Finalizing the Glossary

I'm solidifying the glossary of key terms, ensuring consistency and accuracy across the translation. Key terms are qissīsīn (Priests), ruhbān (Monks), diyārāt wa ṣawāmi' (Monasteries and hermitages), and taḥrīf (distortion). I'm also addressing "the Negus" versus "al-Najāshī" to fit with the instructions.

Addressing Ambiguities

I'm now carefully clarifying the nuanced meanings of key terms and concepts within the text. Specifically, I am zeroing in on interpretations of Laghw in the oaths section. I've noted that the meaning of "Jubb" is more specific than "Khisa'", and will adjust the translation accordingly. I'm also ensuring a consistent approach to verse handling, maintaining original verse numbers when present.

Refining the Translation

I'm now fully immersed in the commentary on verse 5:87, specifically on asceticism. The various narrations on Asbab al-Nuzul, featuring Uthman ibn Maz'un and Ali ibn Abi Talib, illustrate the core message. I must capture the essence of the Prophet's balanced stance, rejecting extreme practices and upholding the importance of a well-rounded faith. I'll translate "Siyahah" carefully. The focus is on finding a clear way to distinguish and explain the linguistic nuances between the differing readings of ‘aqqadtum vs ‘aqadtum.

Revising Narrations

Currently, I'm examining "Siyahah" and its interpretation in context, relating it to monastic wandering. I've noted narrations from Simāk, ‘Ikrimah, Ibn ‘Abbās, and others, confirming the term's association with monks. I'm also ensuring the absence of markdown and verifying segment IDs. I'm double-checking the nuances of P5887, interpreting "al-khayyir fa-al-khayyir" for clarity, and revisiting P5900 with Ibn Rawāḥah's oath narrative.

Preparing the Final Draft

I'm wrapping up the final edits, focusing on consistency and accuracy. I've re-checked the glossary for key terms, including "Siyahah", and ensured the absence of Arabic text in the output. I've also verified the capitalizations of headings. Now I'll generate the final translation.

I've initiated the translation project, focusing on Arabic text segments from Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī. My plan involves meticulously processing each C and P prefixed ID segment. Currently, I'm concentrating on a chapter-by-chapter translation approach, to maintain clarity and accuracy.

Defining Translation Workflow

I'm currently focused on the translation of the Arabic text from Sharḥ ʿIlal al-Tirmiḏī by Ibn Rajab. This work delves deeply into principles of ḥadīth science. Specifically, I'm examining a section on how to determine validity of narrations.

Analyzing Ibn Rajab's Text

I've made considerable progress on translating the section of Sharḥ ʿIlal al-Tirmiḏī discussing weak narrators. My focus is now on the nuances of narrating raqāʾiq versus aḥkām from them. I've pinpointed key scholars like Sufyān al-Thawrī and Ibn al-Mubārak whose perspectives on this matter are central. I'm carefully contrasting their views with other relevant examples.

I've just navigated a very problematic section. The phrase "Tharīd is better than Allah" has become the primary focus. While I suspect a textual error, the instructions mandate a literal translation.

Clarifying the Ambiguity

I've got it! The context from Razi completely clears up the issue. The "min" in the controversial phrase isn't comparative, but denotes source! It's not about comparing tharid to God, it's about saying it's good because it comes from God. This sheds new light on the text, and highlights a case where a literal translation would be misleading.

Analyzing the Implications

I've incorporated Razi's crucial clarification into the revised translation of the third point of P26751. The revised translation accurately captures the non-comparative sense of "min," emphasizing the source of goodness rather than a direct comparison. The revised translation reads, "Tharīd (a meat and bread dish) is good (khayr) from Allah (Exalted is He)" [meaning, it is a good thing from the good things provided by Allah]. This resolves the theological issue. I am now proceeding with C10 63.

I've begun dissecting the request. My focus is now on the source text, al-Muġnī, and the specific domain of Hanbali jurisprudence. The professional context clarifies expectations. I'm actively establishing the parameters of this project.

Establishing the Process

\n\n

My translation approach is crystallizing. High accuracy is paramount, with literalness prioritized unless context dictates a meaning-based shift. I'm prioritizing precise terminology from Islamic jurisprudence and legal theory. I'm confirming formatting requirements, including plain text, ID retention, and careful handling of numeric prefixes. I've noted specific directives on narration chains, Allah usage, ﷺ, and chapter heading capitalization. I've also formalized a three-pass review system for alignment, accuracy, and transliteration. I'm now applying this to the text, starting with C3051 and its nuanced context of loans and fungible items.

Exploring Nuances Further

\n\n

I'm now deep in C3051, dissecting the implications of currency devaluation and bans. Key Hanbali viewpoints are becoming clearer, especially Ahmad's emphasis on the loan's original value. I've begun to translate the specific terms: mustaqriḍ, mithl, fulūs, and mukassarah. I'm wrestling with the nuances of a ruler's decree impacting repayment. My focus shifts to C3052, considering the challenges when transportation costs are involved in returning loaned goods. The question of value versus the actual item's return is taking center stage.

Delving Deeper into Rulings

I'm now analyzing the implications of a loan of wine between dhimmis who later convert, focusing on how this impacts the loan's validity. My drafting now reflects the legal nullification due to the absence of financial value for Muslims. I'm transitioning into the "Book of Pledges/Mortgages" within the al-Mughni for B3053, exploring linguistic and legal definitions of rahn and referencing Qur'anic verses and Hadith. I'm transliterating and translating poetry with the phrase Fara'aytuka bi-rahnin in order to illustrate the concept of the pledge.

Investigating Pledge Dynamics

I'm now fully immersed in P3054 and its related discussions. The poetry introduces subtle interpretations, which leads me to the narrations of 'A'ishah and Abu Hurayrah. I am now exploring the permissibility of pledges in residence. I am carefully analyzing the consensus and counterarguments around verse 2:283. Then, I am looking at whether taking a pledge is obligatory. Finally, I'm examining the timing of a pledge and its implications, especially before a debt exists.

Examining Pledge Validity

I'm presently translating the nuanced legal arguments in C3055. I've focused on possession (Qabḍ) as an essential precondition. I'm carefully translating the varying Hanbali perspectives, and Khiraqi's significant qualification of "one who is permissible in command". I'm now also clarifying how competency (being of sound mind, legal age, and solvent) affects the valid delivery of a pledge. I'm transitioning to P3056, which explores the implications of a pledgor's death.

Assessing Heirs' Obligations

I'm now grappling with the implications of a pledgor's death in the context of C3056, focusing specifically on whether heirs are obligated to fulfill the pledge. I'm carefully examining the logic of heir substitution and how the pledgee's priority is established if the debt encumbers the entire estate. I'm now also exploring textual disagreements regarding priority when the pledge wasn't possessed prior to the death of the pledgor. Moving on to C3057, I'm analyzing how interdiction due to bankruptcy or incompetence influences the pledge's validity.

Interpreting Possession Carefully

I'm now closely analyzing C3058, focusing on the implications of a pledgee relinquishing possession. The crucial question is whether returning the pledged item weakens the pledge's binding nature. I am considering the Hanbali emphasis on Quranic references to possession and its bearing on contract continuity. The varying viewpoints of Malik, Abu Hanifa, and Shafi'i are clarifying. I'm now transitioning into C3059, weighing the conditions required for valid possession without the pledgor's permission.

Refining Possession Criteria

I'm presently translating C3060, scrutinizing the legal nuances regarding valid qabd (possession). I'm focusing on the distinctions between transferable and non-transferable items, and how takhlīyah (vacating) applies to real estate. The details on transferring possession, like giving keys, are becoming clearer. Now I'm diving into C3061 which involves shared portions, particularly the judge's role in resolving disputes over movable property.

Establishing Valid Pledges

I'm now deep in C3062, exploring the complexities of pledging items held by the pledgee through various means (deposit, loan, usurpation). I'm analyzing how these differing possession types affect the pledge's immediate validity according to Ahmad and contrasting the Shafi'i/Qadi view that possession is needed. I'm carefully weighing whether new permission is required and am moving into C3063 to assess how pledging guaranteed items affects liability.

Validating Pledge Conditions

\n\n

I'm now concentrating on P3064, and the situation where one of two pledged items perishes before possession is achieved. The contract's implications regarding the surviving item are complex; the pledgor retains the right to fulfill or not. I'm moving on to C3065, where a house collapse before possession presents different considerations; the land and debris now constitute the pledge. The buyer might have the option to back out, due to the reduced security. I'm now transitioning into the general rule of P3065; any salable item is pledgeable, including undivided shares. The Hanafi dissent's argument is being considered now.

Evaluating Fractional Pledges

I'm now deep in C3066 and C3068, focused on the critical aspects of shared item pledges. I'm carefully analyzing the Hanbali position that permits pledging specific portions of jointly-owned items, countering the potential for division. This is followed by an examination of the rules for mudabbar slaves in pledge situations. I'm drawing comparisons to leasing to clarify the prioritization of debt settlement upon the master's demise. Finally, I'm undertaking a review to ensure terminology accuracy, including a correction for borrower terminology, and am working to render 'closing of the pledge' with an appropriate English equivalent.

Analyzing Terminology Nuances

I've been analyzing the text's usage of "closing" and the related ownership transfer, reflecting the debtor's inability to pay. I'm now conducting a meticulous review for consistency, focusing on the terminology for 'God' as 'Allah'. The translation of kifāyah is under special consideration. Although the text's use may be a typo or reference to a related legal concept of collective obligation, the standard translation is suretyship. To retain the intended meaning, I've elected to maintain kifāyah and have added a relevant note to reflect the legal context.

Revising Terminological Clarity

I'm now focusing on C3069, carefully analyzing the nuanced Hanbali stance on pledging items not directly possessed by the pledgor. The implications of a third party holding the object are becoming clearer, especially regarding the requirement for the pledgee's consent. I've re-examined "closing of the pledge," choosing "settlement of the pledge" for C3053. I have also clarified that for C3069, the third party has the status of a bailee and thus the pledgor's permission is still required. Finally, I'm now transitioning into an assessment of potential errors in my work.

Evaluating Terminological Refinements

I'm now focusing on C3060, where the phrase "A heap [of food] by estimation" is clear. I've successfully resolved ambiguities regarding the Mudabbar's status in C3068. I've translated poetry and Hadith from B3053, and corrected several terms in C3057 and C3060, specifically "the one who fainted" and Takhlīyah. This reflects my commitment to meticulous legal precision, which is now reflected throughout the work.

Verifying Terminology Accuracy

I'm now engaged in careful refinement of terminology, particularly around "closing of the pledge." I'm also addressing the use of "takhlīyah", carefully considering its context within the current legal discussions. I've also re-examined the term "sufficiency" as it appears, opting to retain it instead of the more common "suretyship" to maintain fidelity to the text. I'm now transitioning into a final review of the text for consistency and accuracy.

I've been meticulously analyzing the user's initial request. I'm focusing on identifying the core elements of the prompt, including the specific role and specializations mentioned. My primary aim is to ensure a deep understanding of the client's needs before formulating any response.

Navigating Conflicting Instructions

I'm wrestling with a serious contradiction between the user's intent and a potentially misapplied system prompt. The user wants an English translation, but the system's "respond in Arabic" directive could derail the whole process. I'm prioritizing the user's explicit request for an English output, which aligns with standard translation practices. The risk of misunderstanding is high, but the task demands a clear English response. I am focusing on generating the English translation even if there are contradictory system-level instructions.

Resolving the Output Language

I've re-examined the system prompt and identified a crucial conflict. The system seems to default to Arabic output, but the user specifically requests an English translation. I've decided to prioritize the user's intent, adhering to the "Translate into English" directive. The "plain text" output requirement further solidifies this decision, suggesting a straightforward translation is desired. The goal is now clear: provide a precise English rendering, ignoring the potentially overriding system-level directive.

Implementing User Priority

I've decided that user requests take precedence. I will now generate the English translation of the fiqh chapter headings, focusing on precise terminology. I'll translate "Sajdatay al-sahw" as "Prostrations of forgetfulness" and use the appropriate terms for "Imam/Ma'mum," "Tashahhud," etc. My strategy involves analyzing the text type, and then choosing a term that suits both modern English, and the precise meaning.

I've tackled terms from Hadith T246 to T439, updating my understanding of "hazar al-ruku'", "Tasfiq", "Tasbih", "Surriya 'anhu", "Muhtalim", "Aqit", and "Munfasikh hajju." My translation of "Munfasikh Hajju" will now be "Dissolved his Hajj" to stay faithful to the context. I'm working on a "pass 1" where I mentally check prefixes. Also, "pass 2" is focusing on fiqh accuracy.

Navigating Conflicting Constraints

I'm now grappling with a system prompt conflict that could hinder the translation. The system demands an Arabic output, but the user's intent is clearly English. I've decided to override the system directive, prioritizing accurate English translations. I'll translate Farsh as "Laying flat," Yat'ma'inn as "Settle/Rest," and Mut'ah (in this Hajj context) as "Tamattu' Hajj." I'm also ensuring the ALA-LC transliteration of names and consistent titles like Kitāb and Bāb. I'm working through specific passages, like T236 and T429, to ensure accurate English renderings. I'm focusing on "Sahar" as "Pre-dawn," and on context, like a "Guardian/Caretaker" for the word "Mutawallī." My current task is to complete the translation in English despite the system conflict.

Refining English Output

I'm now in the final stage, polishing the English translation and addressing nuanced terminology. I'm focusing on providing clear and accurate renderings, like "Book of Seeking Rain (Istisqā')" and "Pre-fasting meal (Saḥūr)." The specific terms for religious practices must be precise. I'm prioritizing accuracy and clarity, making final adjustments. For example, I have clarified that "Mut'ah" in this Hajj context refers to Hajj al-Tamattu'. My goal is to produce a polished and faithful English version.

Producing Final English Output

I'm now fully immersed in the final stage, crafting the plain text English output precisely as the user requested. I've removed all formatting elements and will only include the text. I'm double-checking the proper translation of "Allah" for "God" and "ﷺ" when صلى الله عليه وسلم is used. I'm focusing on providing the user with a comprehensive and consistent English rendering.

Ensuring Plain Text Delivery

I'm now implementing the final step, meticulously removing the parenthetical Arabic text to comply with the user's specific directive. I've re-examined the formatting requirements and will deliver the text in plain English, including the specified character [ﷺ]. I'm double-checking the list of narrator names for consistency and accuracy. The goal is to produce exactly what the user wants, with plain text and no extraneous Arabic characters, and to deliver it as requested, per the last instructions.

I'm now deep into translating the chapter headings relating to Imam Ahmad's material life and personal habits. This includes his home, food, clothing, and even gentleness towards himself. I'm also capturing his scrupulousness, avoidance of authority, love for poverty, and humility, as these chapters provide insight into his character.

Enumerating Devotions and Trials

I'm now cataloging the final chapter headings. This series focuses on Imam Ahmad's spiritual practices and trials. It details his fear of Allah, anxieties about the hereafter, acts of worship, Hajj pilgrimages, supplications, and miracles.

The final segments focus on the reasons for choosing his school of thought, the virtue of his companions and followers, and a rollcall of notable figures from his time through today. I'm prioritizing accurate ALA-LC transliteration of the names.

Refining Terminology Choices

I'm now zeroing in on precise translations for several key terms. The distinction between Ra'y (opinion) and Naql (transmission) is crucial to understanding Hanbali thought. I'm also refining translations for terms like Satr al-Ta'abbud (concealing worship), Ẓilf nafsihi (restraining himself), Wilāyāt (positions of authority), and Khumūl al-Dhikr (obscurity of fame). Moreover, I've confirmed that Miḥnah refers to the Inquisition. Finally, I'm verifying the transliteration of names, like Aḥmad ibn Abī Khaythamah Zuhayr ibn Ḥarb.

I'm focusing on ALA-LC conventions to keep them uniform, and am verifying any transliteration uncertainties. I'll need to go back and check for consistency as I continue on.

Transliterating Narrators Names

I'm now completing the transliteration of the remaining names from the narrator list, ensuring strict adherence to ALA-LC conventions. I've finished translating names through 'Abd al-Wahhāb al-Warrāq and am currently working on 'Abd al-Malik ibn 'Abd al-Ḥamīd al-Maymūnī. It's time-consuming to ensure all are consistent.

Finishing Name Translations

I'm finalizing the translation of remaining names, focusing on figures from Chapter 12 through the end of the work. I've successfully completed the translation of names and am presently verifying the transliterations to ensure they adhere to ALA-LC conventions.

Confirming Name Consistency

I'm now cross-referencing the translated names against authoritative sources to ensure accuracy, and to confirm transliterations for consistency. This includes cross-checking names from the final chapters. For example, I'm working on T168, ensuring "Qashīsh" is correct, and I'm also confirming "al-Ḥanbalī" for T169. It's critical to have consistency when dealing with so many people.

Verifying Name Accuracy

I'm presently focused on accurately transliterating and translating the remaining names, including figures like 'Umar ibn Ibrāhīm ibn 'Abd Allāh Abū Ḥafṣ al-'Ukbarī and others from the latter chapters, ensuring precise ALA-LC adherence and resolving transliteration ambiguities.

Currently, I'm verifying the names of the final narrators from T194 through T206, including Abū Ja'far 'Abd al-Khāliq ibn 'Īsá al-Hāshimī, 'Abd al-Raḥmān ibn Muḥammad ibn Isḥāq ibn Mandah al-Aṣbahānī Abū al-Qāsim, and Abū Bakr Aḥmad ibn Muḥammad al-Rāzī the Reciter, known as Ibn Ḥamdawayh, among others.

Concluding Name Transliterations

I've translated and transliterated the final list of names for T207 through T220, meticulously following ALA-LC conventions. Included are figures such as Abū Bakr Aḥmad ibn 'Alī ibn Aḥmad al-'Ulabī, Abū al-Fatḥ Muḥammad ibn 'Alī al-Ḥulwānī, and Abū al-Wafā' 'Alī ibn 'Aqīl ibn Muḥammad ibn 'Aqīl al-Baghdādī.

Confirming Final Narrators

I'm now diligently verifying the remaining names against authoritative resources, including Abū al-Barakāt 'Abd al-Wahhāb ibn al-Mubārak al-Anmāṭī and Abū Bakr Aḥmad ibn Muḥammad ibn Aḥmad al-Dīnawarī. Also, I'm focusing on transliteration nuances for T226, ensuring that Jīlī is the precise form, even if variations exist.

Translating Name Variations

I'm presently tackling a tricky instance of a name variant, and have to decide how to proceed. Given the requirement to translate the text literally, should I keep the typo al-Nahzawānī or the expected al-Nahrawānī? I'm leaning towards the correction since "highest level of accuracy" implies factual fidelity. However, to remain true to the prompt, I'm noting the source says Zay, but it should be a Haw. This seems like the best approach given the constraints.

Verifying Name Variants

I'm now cross-referencing T231 through T233, specifically double-checking diacritics and confirming transliterations. I'm focusing on names like Abū al-'Alā' al-Ḥasan ibn Aḥmad ibn al-Ḥasan al-'Aṭṭār al-Hamadhānī, Abū Muḥammad 'Abd Allāh ibn Aḥmad ibn al-Khashshāb the Grammarian, and Abū Ya'lá Muḥammad ibn Muḥammad ibn Muḥammad ibn al-Farrā', to ensure ALA-LC compliance. The final polishing stage is now approaching, and I am focused on the highest standards.

Resolving Transliteration Challenges

I'm now focusing on specific transliteration nuances and correcting a series of inconsistencies. I'm choosing al-Marwadhī over al-Marūdhī for T113 as that seems the most accurate ALA-LC-compliant rendering of المروذي. I'm also adding [Allāh] where brackets exist in T191. Furthermore, I corrected the typo T176 from al-Tamīm to al-Tamīmī, as it makes the most sense.

Confirming Name Accuracy

I'm verifying the final name transliterations and making a key decision regarding a name variant. Although the source text includes "al-Nahzawānī," the standard and more accurate form appears to be "al-Nahrawānī." Given the priority of accuracy and context, I've decided to use the latter, making the required correction while acknowledging the discrepancy. I'm also confirming titles and formatting to complete this first pass.

I'm currently focused on dissecting al-Shawkānī's Irshād al-Fuḥul, specifically segments P538 through C563. The goal is a professional Arabic to [Target Language] translation.

My priority now is to gain a deep understanding of the source material before attempting any translation.

Clarifying Translation Principles

I'm solidifying my translation guidelines, emphasizing accuracy and the use of precise Islamic terminology within the Usul al-Fiqh context. I'll maintain plain text formatting, preserving IDs and using ALA-LC for narrators while keeping their actions in English. "Allah" and "ﷺ" remain consistent. Three revisions will be performed. I've initiated translation with P538, aiming for accuracy and context preservation.

Considering Salaf's Stance

I'm now grappling with al-Juwaynī's position, as referenced by al-Dhahabī. I'm focusing on the Salaf's avoidance of ta'wīl, their adherence to ẓawāhir, and their tafwīḍ. Currently, I'm refining the translation of key phrases, like "passing the apparent meanings over their courses." Also, al-Shawkānī's use of mawaridiha is under scrutiny. This section will begin with "CHAPTER 3: CONCERNING SHUR...".

Refining Ta'wīl's Conditions

I've translated Section Three, focusing on the conditions of ta'wīl. I'm now refining the draft translation of P540. I'm focusing on the condition of permissible specification and the division of interpretation into likely, unlikely, and impossible interpretations. The concept of "preponderance" requires careful consideration, and I'm looking at ways to render the nuances of murajjiḥ accurately. I'm moving on to Chapter Eight.

Delving into al-Shawkānī's Text

I'm now investigating the divisions of the Pronounced (al-Manṭūq) and the Implied (al-Mafhūm) as delineated by al-Shawkānī. I'm focusing on defining Naṣṣ, Ẓāhir, and their subdivisions, including Dalālat al-Iqtiḍā', Īmā', and Ishārah. I'm carefully examining the subtle distinctions between these concepts, particularly the nuances of ta'līl in the context of Dalālat al-Īmā' and Dalālat al-Ishārah.

Elaborating Implication Subtypes

I'm now diving into the specifics of Mafhūm al-Muwāfaqah and Mafhūm al-Mukhālafah. I'm wrestling with the nuances of Faḥwā al-Khiṭāb and Laḥn al-Khiṭāb within Muwāfaqah. Al-Rāzī's perspective on these concepts and the debate regarding their linguistic or analogical basis are coming into sharper focus. Specifically, I'm examining Dalālat al-Naṣṣ, as Hanafis call it, in contrast to whether it arises from speech or analogy.

Evaluating Divergent Implications

I'm now wrestling with the nuances of Mafhūm al-Mukhālafah (Divergent Implication), particularly the disagreements surrounding its validity. I'm focusing on the debate over whether it functions as a linguistic or religious proof. Al-Shawkānī's arguments on the scope of negation and the status of certainty within Mafhūm al-Mukhālafah are under scrutiny, especially regarding whether it applies to specific cases or broadly.

Defining Implication Conditions

I'm presently translating al-Shawkānī's conditions for Mafhūm al-Mukhālafah, specifically the seven conditions outlined. I'm focusing on the intricacies of each condition, ensuring accurate translation of key phrases, like "Not opposed by something stronger," and "Mention is not for gratitude/bounty". I'm now wrestling with potential nuances in translation. Also, the phrasing of specific examples. I am now working on condition three.

Classifying Implications Further

I'm now grappling with the fourth type of divergent implication, Mafhūm al-Ḥālah (Implication of State/Condition). I'm carefully translating the different categories within it, focusing on differentiating between the Ḥālah of absence and presence. Also, I'm analyzing the linguistic and legal conditions that establish its validity. I'm moving on to explore the differing opinions of Muḥaddithīn and Fuqahā' on the matter.

Delineating Implication Types

I'm now focusing on Al-Shawkānī's categorization of Implication. I've translated and analyzed Mafhūm al-Ḥālah, moving into the different types. Currently, I'm examining Mafhūm al-‘Adad and Mafhūm al-Ghāyah, including examples like the number of lashes. I'm exploring their acceptance among scholars. I'm moving on to Mafhūm al-Laqab and the debates surrounding its validity as a proof.

Classifying Further Implications

I'm presently translating Mafhūm al-Ḥaṣr (Implication of Restriction). I'm focusing on the different linguistic forms employed, such as "Mā... illā" (None... except) and "Innamā" (Only). I've begun translating the implications of the definite article in subject/predicate ordering, like "The Scholar is Zayd." I'm also delving into Mafhūm al-Ḥāl and Mafhūm al-Zamān, including their subtypes and exploring their distinctions. This will lead to the abrogation section.

Elaborating Abrogation Concepts

I'm now delving into the abrogation section, focusing on its permissibility and occurrence as established by al-Shawkānī. I'm translating "abrogation is permissible rationally and occurs scripturally," carefully considering the implications of "rationally" and "scripturally." I'm also grappling with the theological objections, particularly the concept of the "Eternal Speech" of Allah, and al-Shawkānī's response, clarifying the abrogation of the ruling's attachment, not the Speech itself. I am now working on C563.

Analyzing Key Terms Further

I'm presently translating key terms within al-Shawkānī's discussion of the Pronounced and Implied, specifically Mafhūm al-Muwāfaqah and Mafhūm al-Mukhālafah, the "tenor of speech" (Faḥwā al-Khiṭāb) and "allusion of speech" (Laḥn al-Khiṭāb). I'm carefully rendering sā'imah and ma'lūfah appropriately. Also, I am revising a footnote for proper transliteration of key scholars, including al-Juwaynī and al-Dhahabī.

Clarifying Implication Types

I've just refined the translation of al-Shawkānī's distinction between Faḥwā and Laḥn, focusing on their implications and nuances. I'm now exploring the implication of the "Zakat in grazing sheep" example, considering whether it implies that fed sheep are not subject to zakat. Further, I'm examining how this logic might apply more broadly to other animals. The section on Naskh is complete; I'm clarifying the difference between "elimination" and "transfer" of rulings.

Revising Verse Translations

I've just been refining the verse translations, ensuring their accuracy and relevance to the surrounding text. The phraseology of some verses has been corrected for clarity, while others have been rendered more precisely. I'm prioritizing accuracy. I'm still revising the verses for improved precision and clarity. Additionally, I'm working to make sure that the text is plain and free from markup, ensuring that the final output is clean and readily usable.

Synthesizing Terminology Equivalents

I'm now integrating the equivalence between Dalālat al-Naṣṣ, as used by Hanafis, and Mafhūm al-Muwāfaqah, as defined by Shafi'is, into my framework. This clarification helps unify the terminology. The text highlights a crucial equivalency. I'm focusing on ensuring consistent translation, which should now be improved. The translation is steadily progressing toward final revision.

I'm currently focused on the translation from Irshād al-Fuḥul, aiming for clarity and precision in representing the original Arabic text on Islamic Legal Theory. I'm carefully analyzing al-Shawkānī's work, ensuring I grasp the nuances of his arguments. My primary concern is conveying the intended meaning while remaining true to the source material's style. I'm exploring various translation approaches to achieve the most accurate and elegant rendering.

Refining Translation Parameters

My focus has shifted to refining the translation guidelines. I'm prioritizing accuracy, preserving technical Islamic terminology, and meticulously adhering to ALA-LC transliteration standards for narrator names. I'm ensuring all the specific translation instructions are consistently applied, and working on a three-pass revision process to guarantee precision. My aim is to deliver a translation that's both accurate and true to the source.

Analyzing Ambiguity Argument

I'm deep into the discussion of ambiguity in the theft verse. The Hanafis' view that "hand" and "cutting" are ambiguous is really sparking my interest. I'm focusing on the majority's rebuttal, particularly how they interpret "hand" both absolutely and restrictively, referencing related verses. Refining this to accurately represent the Arabic terminology and legal reasoning is paramount. I'm carefully considering how "kūʿ" specifically refers to the wrist.

Dissecting Negation Nuances

I'm now grappling with the negation particles in the verse, exploring whether "No prayer..." signifies invalidity or imperfection. The majority's stance on legal versus linguistic usage is fascinating; they prioritize invalidity when legal usage exists, or it defaults to the linguistic usage, and lastly to invalidity when there is no established usage. I'm focusing on their assertion that literal negation is impossible, leading to the focus on legal essence. I'm carefully comparing the linguistic and legal meanings to ensure an accurate representation of the Arabic nuances.

Exploring Ambiguity Examples

I'm now examining specific examples of ambiguity, such as the interpretations of "mistake and forgetfulness have been lifted." The core issue revolves around the literal versus legal implications of "lifted" (rufiʿa). I'm analyzing the majority's view on sin/punishment, al-Ghazali's on ruling, and Basran/Razi's on lifting all legal effects, and comparing those, and how they relate to the negation example. I'm focusing on the different meanings each stance attaches to the negation of obligation, and the issue of sin versus guarantee. I'm also considering how these examples illustrate the broader arguments about words oscillating between multiple meanings and how they are handled.

Investigating Ambiguity Examples

I'm now examining the "two meanings" of a word and its implications. I'm looking at differing perspectives on the ambiguity of a word. Al-Ghazālī sees it as ambiguous, while Al-Āmidī opts for the most useful meaning. I'm focusing on Zarkashī's analysis of words with two equal possibilities, and the author's argument for ambiguity when no clear preference exists. I'm also delving into the conflict between linguistic and legal meanings, particularly the majority's view on prioritizing the legal interpretation.

Synthesizing Bayan Categories

I'm now integrating the discussion on Bayān, examining different ranks of clarification. I'm focusing on text emphasis, grammatical particles, and how the Sunnah clarifies Quranic ambiguity and establishes new rulings. I'm also delving into Shafi'i's categorization and the objections regarding ambiguity within this framework. My current aim is to connect these categories and their application.

Analyzing Bayan Clarifications

I'm now deeply immersed in the nuances of Bayān and its various methods, especially the relationship between speech and action. My focus is on the interplay between different methods of clarification, particularly the use of Tanbīh (alerting) and the implications of the Prophet's actions versus his words. I'm exploring Zarkashī's defense of Shafi'i's views on clarifying Quranic ambiguity and the varying hierarchy of clarification. I'm carefully contrasting the majority's views on the precedence of speech over action.

Examining Bayan Delay

I'm now focusing on the permissibility of delaying clarification, or Taʾkhīr al-Bayān. I'm exploring the nuances of this delay, particularly in the context of the need for an explanation. I'm focusing on the differing views, and examining the majority, Ash'arī, Muʿtazilah, Hanafī, and Zahirī perspectives. The debate centers on whether delaying clarification is permissible, especially before the time of the need. I'm carefully comparing the justifications and proofs offered by the opposing schools, especially regarding verses and examples that are considered arguments.

Delving into Delayed Clarifications

I'm now focusing on the nuances of delayed clarifications, especially in commands, prohibitions, and news, and specifically what's permissible versus impermissible. The gradual clarification, like Specification after Specification, is of particular interest. I'm carefully comparing the definitions of "apparent" (Ẓ 
a
ˉ
 hir) and "interpreted" (Muʾawwal), noting the difference from Naṣṣ. I'm also examining the roots and various technical definitions of Taʾwīl. I'm considering the potential meanings of the word awwal, and the implication of the other words. I'm focusing on the technical legal implications and the specific instances where a legal ruling is subject to interpretation.

Clarifying Interpretation Nuances

I'm now refining the understanding of Taʾwīl, distinguishing valid from corrupt interpretations. It's critical to determine if a proof elevates a probable meaning. I'm also analyzing the author's nuanced view, which prioritizes adhering to the literal meaning unless conclusive evidence justifies interpretation. The implications for theological discussions about Allah's attributes, especially how the Salaf approached it, are coming into focus. I'm focusing on the three groups: the literalists, the allegorists, and those who tread the middle ground.

Analyzing Textual Implications

I'm currently engaged in analyzing the implications of spoken versus implied meanings (Manṭūq and Mafhūm). I'm focusing on how these concepts relate to explicit and implicit legal rulings. Specifically, I'm examining the role of "wrist" (k 
u
ˉ
 ʿ) in legal discussions, and the importance of accurate terminology in the translation. I'm also carefully refining the translation of key terms like "Ambiguity" (Ijmāl), "Explicit Text" (Naṣṣ), "Literal/Metaphorical" (Haqīqah/Majāz), and "Clarification" (Bayān) to convey the precise meanings. My aim is to accurately represent the original concepts while adhering to translation guidelines.

Correcting Transliterations

I'm now diligently correcting transliterations, verifying terms, and formatting the output. I'm ensuring consistency in translating verses, like rendering "Al-Hamdu lillahi rabbi al-alamin" as "All praise is due to Allah, Lord of the worlds." I've also addressed the skipped text in P279b.

Okay, I've started the analysis of the request. The source material is Musnad al-Shāfīʿī in Arabic, and I'm stepping into my role as a professional Arabic to English translator, specifically for Islamic content.

Clarifying Translation Goals

I'm now zeroing in on the specifics: my English-speaking audience demands precision with Islamic terminology. Accuracy is paramount; I'll stick to a literal approach unless the context strongly implies a need for a meaning-based translation. I've committed to using Arabic terms, with the appropriate conventions for narrators and the Prophet's name. Formatting is straightforward plain text. I've begun to tackle the source text, carefully interpreting each segment, starting with the Basmala and the title of the drinking section.

Examining Vessel Details

I'm presently focused on the vessels mentioned in the Musnad. I've just translated a passage where Anas b. Mālik describes breaking jars containing the drink khamr using a stone mortar. The specific details, like the type of jar and the mortar, are key for historical and cultural context. I'm noting the use of mihrās as a stone mortar.

Analyzing Alcohol Prohibition

I'm now delving into the hadith regarding alcohol, specifically focusing on its prohibition. I've translated two key pieces: the chapter title declaring intoxicating drinks ḥarām, and a narration from Ibn ʿUmar about the Prophet's warning against unrepentant drinkers. I'm noting the narrators, especially al-Shāfīʿī, and meticulously capturing the chain of transmission. The editor's comments are being noted, as well as the exact wording on the prohibition of khamr. I'm careful to preserve the precise language of the Prophet.

Investigating Prohibition Details

I'm presently translating two hadiths emphasizing the prohibition of intoxicating drinks. First, the Prophet's statement, "Every drink that intoxicates is ḥarām," as narrated by 'Aisha, and then a similar statement regarding bitʿ, conveyed via Malik. Both translations are underway, paying close attention to the chains of transmission and the precise wording of the Prophet's statements. The different narrators are noted and the meaning of ḥarām is being accurately depicted.

Expanding Prohibition Details

I've just finished the translation of two more hadiths related to the prohibition of intoxicants. Sufyān's narration of Ibn Ṭāwūs regarding bitʿ is complete, and Abū al-Juwayriyah's question about al-Bādhiq to Ibn ʿAbbās is also done. Finally, I've started the translation where every intoxicant is khamr using the chain of Mālik, Nāfiʿ, and Ibn ʿUmar.

Analyzing New Hadith

I've just translated the latest piece from the Musnad. I'm working through a narration where Ibn ʿUmar states, "Every intoxicant is khamr, and every khamr is ḥarām." It's a straightforward but crucial hadith regarding the scope of the prohibition. I'm noting that Mālik is the narrator, and carefully capturing the direct words of Ibn ʿUmar and how this relates to broader prohibition.

Translating Further Prohibition

I'm currently focused on the prohibition of al-Ghubayrāʾ and cooked drinks. The Prophet's prohibition of al-Ghubayrāʾ and the editor's comments on that, along with a hadith from Zayd and ʿAṭāʾ is now translated. I'm also carefully examining the chapter discussing drinks boiled until two-thirds evaporate. I've noted the chains of transmission and the precise wording of the Prophet's statement, and the comments of Al-Shafi'i.

Analyzing Climate & Drink

I'm now grappling with the narration regarding ʿUmar b. al-Khaṭṭāb's encounter in Syria. I've translated the initial complaint about the climate and the suggested remedy of honey. The fascinating aspect is the locals' attempt to create a non-intoxicating drink and ʿUmar's reaction. I'm focusing on the term Ṭilāʾ and ʿUbādah's objection, which highlights the critical legal point of not making lawful what Allah has made unlawful. I'm also carefully noting the chain of transmission.

Assessing Prohibition Clarification

I've just translated the final passage concerning ʿUmar's reaction to the locals' attempt to create a permissible drink. I've noted ʿUmar's initial permission based on the drink's non-intoxicating nature, then his withdrawal upon seeing its consistency, which he compared to pitch (Ṭilāʾ). The legal clash with ʿUbādah's objection regarding the risk of rendering lawful what is forbidden adds a crucial layer. I'm carefully capturing the dialogue's nuance, especially ʿUmar's retraction and subsequent prayer to God.

Examining Nabidh Prohibition

I'm now fully immersed in the Musnad's rulings on nabīdh (infusions). I've just translated the prohibition on mixing specific fruits for fermentation, including dates and unripe dates, as narrated by al-Shāfīʿī. My attention to detail extends to noting the chains of transmission and the precise wording of the Prophet's pronouncements. The focus now is on accurately portraying the restrictions and their underlying legal rationale as conveyed through the hadith. I am now translating the next narrations of Mālik and others to gain a deeper understanding of the prohibition of nabidh composition.

Translating Vessel Prohibition

I'm presently translating two more hadiths from the Musnad, this time focusing on vessels. First, the hadith where the Prophet (PBUH) forbids nabīdh in green, white, and red earthenware jars, narrated by Ibn Abī Awfā through the chain of al-Shāfīʿī. I'm taking care to accurately depict the vessel types. Then, there's the prohibition against nabīdh in Dubba, Naqīr, Muzaffat, and Ḥantam vessels, conveyed by Abū Hurayrah through the chain of Sufyān and al-Zuhrī. I'm focusing on the precise wording and context of the prohibition.

I've just concluded the translation of the final hadiths concerning forbidden vessels. I've accurately rendered the narration from Abū Hurayrah, transmitted via Sufyān and al-Zuhrī, which details the Prophet's prohibition against Dubbāʾ (gourds), Muzaffat (pitch-coated vessels), Ḥanātim (green glazed jars), and Naqīr (hollowed stumps). I've also completed the hadith from Anas b. Mālik, through Sufyān and al-Zuhrī, which reiterates the prohibition of Dubbāʾ and Muzaffat. Finally, I've translated Ibn ʿUmar's narration, conveyed through Mālik and Nāfiʿ, that records the Prophet's address and the prohibition of Dubbāʾ and Muzaffat. I am satisfied with the final output.

Expanding Vessel Restrictions

I've just finished the translation of two more hadiths related to the prohibition of vessels used for nabīdh. I've rendered the narration of Ibn ʿUmar via Malik, al-ʿAla b. ʿAbd al-Rahman, and Abu Hurayrah which details the Prophet's prohibition against nabīdh in dry gourds and pitch-coated vessels, as well as Sufyan's narration of the narration of Sulayman al-Ahwal, Mujahid and 'Abd Allah b. 'Amr b. al-'As where, because of a lack of suitable vessels, the Prophet permitted earthenware jars not coated with pitch.

Adding Stone Vessel Detail

I've just translated the latest narration from the Musnad. The chain is Sufyān -> Abū al-Zubayr -> Jābir. It describes the Prophet's practice of having nabīdh made in a waterskin, but if none was available, it could be made in a stone trough (tawr). This adds another layer to the permissible vessels. I've noted that this hadith is from the Book of Drinks.

Examining Punishment Exceptions

I'm now diving into the latest hadith about exceptions to prescribed punishments. The focus is on the interpretation that this leniency applies only to situations where a Ḥadd isn't involved. I've translated the chain of transmission, tracing back to Aisha, and am carefully rendering the Prophet's statement about pardoning people of status. The editor's commentary is proving critical in understanding the scope of this exemption.

Assessing Lenience Scope

I've just translated the latest narrations concerning exceptions to punishments. The focus is now on Umar b. al-Khattab's statement about Qudamah, a veteran of Badr. I'm carefully examining the implication that a severe punishment might set a precedent. The chapter title on prescribed punishments as expiation is also being analyzed. Finally, I've translated the Baya'ah chapter, noting that whoever fulfills the pledge receives a reward.

Summarizing Expiation Rules

I've just translated the latest passage, which clarifies the consequences of sin. I've rendered the Prophet's statement on pledges, emphasizing the reward for keeping them and the expiatory nature of worldly punishment. I'm focusing on the editor's comments on the interplay between divine concealment and Allah's discretion. The translation of the chapter on repeating drinking punishments is now complete.

Analyzing Drinking Punishments

I'm presently translating the chain of transmission for the latest hadith, tracing it from al-Shāfīʿī to Qabīṣah b. Dhuʾayb. I'm noting the Prophet's initial statement about lashing for multiple instances of drinking, culminating in potential execution. The abrogation details are critical, with the editor highlighting that this was later reduced to lashing. I'm focusing on the exact wording and understanding the change in punishment.

Summarizing Punishment Details

I'm translating the Bāb Miqdār al-Ḥadd chapter, focusing on punishment measures. I've translated two related hadiths. The first, narrated by Sufyān, al-Zuhrī, and Qabīṣah, describes the Prophet's instruction to lash a drinker. The second involves the Prophet's handling of a drinker during the Ḥunayn campaign, and includes the editor's comments on the evolution of punishments, from the Prophet's rebuke to Abū Bakr and ʿUmar's lashings.

Analyzing Punishment Evolution

I've just finished the translation of a new hadith from the Musnad. I'm focusing on the punishments for drinking and the evolution of those punishments. I've translated the hadith describing the Prophet's reaction to a drinker, including the initial physical punishment and later rebuke, as well as the transition to lashing under Abū Bakr and ʿUmar. The editor's insights on the escalating severity of these penalties are key. I'm now examining ʿAlī's advice regarding eighty lashes based on the logic of intoxication leading to slander.

Translating Lash Details

I'm translating the hadith on the punishment using a whip with two ends. The chain leads to ʿAlī lashing al-Walīd. I'm focusing on the editor's comments on the double-ended whip. The precise wording in the chain of transmission and the severity of the lashings are central to my current focus.

Analyzing Lash Justification

I'm currently delving into the justification for the lash punishment, particularly focusing on Umar's actions after detecting the smell of an intoxicating drink, tilāʾ. I've translated the narration where Umar investigated the drink, and if it proved intoxicating, he would have applied the full Hadd punishment. I'm focusing on the editor's comments, and the exact language used.

Analyzing Lash Details

I've just translated the latest narration concerning the Hadd punishment. I'm focusing on ʿUmar's reaction to the smell of intoxicants during a funeral. I've rendered the exact words of Umar, noting his intent to punish if the drink proved intoxicating. I'm carefully capturing the chains of transmission, specifically Sufyān's narration and Maʿmar's confirmation of the punishment. I am working on how this fits into the overall view.

Translating Group Punishment

I'm now focusing on the implications of group drinking and subsequent punishments. I've translated ʿAṭāʾ's view: if a group shares a drink and one becomes intoxicated, all should be lashed. Shāfiʿī aligns with ʿUmar's position. Also, ʿAlī confirms lashing anyone brought before him for drinking khamr or intoxicating nabīdh.

Analyzing Adultery Punishments

I'm currently delving into the final sections. I've translated two more key passages detailing the Hadd punishment for adultery. These passages, from the Book of Punishments, clarify the Prophet's pronouncements on punishments for both virgins and previously married individuals. I'm focusing on accurately capturing the specific punishments of lashes, exile, and stoning. The chains of transmission from al-Shāfīʿī and ʿUbādah are essential for accurate rendering.

Analyzing Transmission Issues

I'm now engaged in deciphering the hadith chains, starting with a note about a potential missing link in the chain connecting al-Hasan and 'Ubada, with a question on how it got lost in the translation process. I'm also translating the P773 chain from Malik to Umar, emphasizing the stoning punishment for adultery by married individuals, as per the Quran.

Finalizing Translation Review

I'm now fully immersed in the final review and editing phase. The translations are complete, and I am meticulously comparing the translated text to the original Arabic source, ensuring accuracy. I've finished rendering the final set of passages, and am focusing on the hadith chain integrity, paying attention to the details of stoning and all its related details. I am now double-checking every detail of the final output.

Detailing Final Hadith Narrations

I've just translated the final hadith which narrates the expanded version of the previous story. The narration involves the same chain of transmission: Mālik, al-Zuhrī, ʿUbayd Allāh, and then Abū Hurayrah and Zayd b. Khālid. It is a detailed account of how the judgement was carried out by the Prophet. Now, I am completely done with all the translations.

Analyzing Adultery Case

I've just translated the final hadith. It's a comprehensive case of adultery. A laborer commits adultery with his employer's wife. I've rendered the precise words of the men. There's a request to judge by the Book of Allah and a dispute over the judgment. The laborers' father ransomed his son for 100 sheep and a slave girl. There are lashes and exile for the son, and stoning for the woman. I've noted the chain and the actions taken by Unays. All translations are now complete.

Reviewing Completed Transcripts

I've just finalized the comprehensive review of all translated content. Every detail has been cross-referenced with the original Arabic to ensure accuracy. The completed translation includes the narratives about the man and woman. The focus is now on ensuring the precise rendering of the legal implications of the stoning. I have now completed all the translations.

I've just translated the final hadith detailing the case of the disabled man. It describes the Prophet's judgment: lashing with a cluster of palm dates. I am now working on Umar's statement on stoning, as found in the Book of Allah.

Completing Stoning Details

I've just translated the final hadith. It narrates a case of adultery where ʿUmar orders stoning based on the wife's confession, after she is questioned by Abū Wāqid. I'm focusing on the precise wording of ʿUmar's judgment and the details provided by the narrator. The chain of transmission is carefully examined for accuracy. The translation is now complete.

Focusing Translation Completion

I'm now fully immersed in the final translations. Just rendered the latest hadith involving ʿUmar and the stoning of the woman based on her confession, noting all the nuances from the narration. Also, rendered a hadith about the relationship between two step-siblings, detailing their confession and Umar's judgment. I'm carefully translating and cross-verifying everything. The translation is now complete.

Analyzing Punishments' Context

My current focus is on the Musnad's later sections dealing with specific case studies. I've finished rendering the final set of narratives concerning the punishments for various transgressions, ranging from adultery to lesser offenses. I'm now cross-referencing all these translations with the original Arabic, with specific focus on the editor's comments on the chain of transmission.

Analyzing Slave Punishments

I'm presently translating two more hadiths from the Musnad, this time about punishments for slave girls who commit adultery. I've finished rendering the first narration, which addresses the Prophet's response to the case of a slave girl who commits adultery, and it includes his directive to lash her and not rebuke her. Then, there's another hadith where Fāṭimah, the Prophet's daughter, lashes her slave girl for committing zina.

Analyzing Slave Punishment Clarifications

I've just translated the final hadith. It addresses the case of the slave girl who commits adultery, and it includes the Prophet's directive to lash her and not rebuke her. Also, the hadith chain from al-Shāfīʿī, Muslim b. Khālid, Ibn Jurayj, Hishām b. ʿUrwah, his father, and Yaḥyā b. Ḥāṭib is complete. I'm noting the details of the slave girl, her confession, and the subsequent punishment according to the Book of Disagreement of ʿAlī.

Examining Contradictions

My thoughts are now deeply focused on a potentially paradoxical hadith. I've translated ʿUmar's application of a punishment (lashing and exile) that seems to contradict the principle "No Hadd on one who doesn't know." I'm exploring how he could reconcile ʿUthmān's argument with his actions, considering the possibility of a different legal classification or interpreting Hadd narrowly. The editor's comments will be important, as will fiqh context, given that she was married.

Clarifying Punishment Scenario

I'm now fully immersed in the Musnad's later sections dealing with specific case studies. Just translated the final hadith which details a slave girl who was pregnant and was brought to ʿUmar for adjudication on the zina crime. ʿUmar gave a punishment after hearing both sides. I am translating his words.

Analyzing Punishments' Nuance

I'm now grappling with the latest hadith about a pregnant slave girl, translating ʿUmar's words and actions. He sentences her after examining the case, noting her confession. The editor's comments on the complex legal issues raised by the case are essential to the analysis. The chain is now translated and the narrative is complete.

Focusing Theft Punishment Detail

I've just translated the latest passage, which clarifies the prescribed punishment for theft. This focuses on the specific conditions for amputation based on the value of the stolen item. I've rendered the narration from ʿĀʾishah, detailing the Prophet's directive on the minimum value requiring amputation. My focus is now on the precise wording and its legal implications within the broader context of Islamic jurisprudence.

Analyzing Theft Punishment Detail

I'm presently translating two more hadiths from the Musnad, this time about amputation for theft. I've rendered the first narration, where the Prophet amputated a thief's hand for stealing a shield valued at three dirhams, via the chain of Malik, Nafi, and Ibn Umar. The second focuses on a thief who stole a citron worth three dirhams during Uthman's time, narrated by Malik via Abdullah bin Abi Bakr. I'm noting the exchange rate, twelve dirhams to a dinar, and Malik's comment on the citron.

Summarizing Punishment Value

I've just translated the latest narrations focusing on the value threshold for theft punishment. I've finished rendering the hadith from ʿĀʾishah, detailing that a theft exceeding three dirhams warrants amputation. Then, I've translated Mālik's narration about Abū Bakr cutting a thief, for a value even less than three dirhams would be valued. Also, I translated the hadith describing how ʿAlī determined the amputation value to be a quarter of a dinar or more.

Translating Theft Punishment Detail

I've just translated the final hadith. ʿĀʾishah's response to the boy's theft of the cloak, involving felt stuffing, is now rendered. Her statement about amputation only applying to thefts of 1/4 dinar or more is now clarified. I'm noting that Mālik reports this chain, which concludes the section on theft-related punishments.

Detailing Theft Narrative

I've just translated the latest narration from the Musnad. The chain is Mālik -> ʿAbd al-Raḥmān b. al-Qāsim -> his father. It describes a Yemeni man, already amputated, who came to Abū Bakr complaining of injustice. The narrative then shifts to missing jewelry from Asmāʾ, found with the amputated man, who confessed. Abū Bakr ordered his left hand cut, noting the severity of the man's self-incriminating prayer.

Summarizing Punishment Detail

I'm presently translating two more hadiths from the Musnad. The first is where Abū Bakr orders the second hand to be cut for a Yemeni man already amputated, after jewelry is found with him, completing the theft narration. Then, the next chapter starts, Idhā Waṣala al-Ḥadd ilā al-Imām, detailing the legal implications of the ruler's responsibility regarding prescribed punishments.

Examining Theft Amnesty

I'm now fully immersed in the Musnad's later sections dealing with specific case studies. Just translated the final hadith detailing the story of Safwan b. Umayyah, involving the theft of his cloak and the Prophet's response. Safwan did not want the amputation. The editor's comments about the legal implications are key to my focus. I'm now cross-verifying the last translation details.

Finalizing Punishment Rulings

I'm presently translating two more hadiths related to theft. I've rendered the narration about the charity given to a thief before the Prophet's judgment, followed by the Prophet's query about why the matter wasn't reported earlier. I've also translated a similar account via Sufyān, 'Amr b. Shu'ayb, and Ṭāwūs. I've started the new chapter on cutting and clan fines as well. The story of ʿUmar and the slaves of Ḥāṭib, and Umar's order and order to collect the double value of the stolen camel is translated.

Analyzing Camel Theft Punishment

I've just translated the latest narration concerning the punishment for the theft of a camel. The story of Ḥāṭib's slaves stealing a Muzaynah man's camel and ʿUmar's subsequent actions, including the cutting of hands and the financial penalty, are now rendered. I'm also translating the next hadith about Ibn ʿUmar's slave who stole while being a runaway (ābiq), and the hand being cut. I'm noting the specific details of the crime, the involved parties, and the legal judgments.

Clarifying Slave Theft Rulings

I'm now rendering the new hadith involving a slave and the issue of theft within his master's household. I'm noting the chapter title, "The Slave is Not Cut for Stealing His Master's Wealth," which emphasizes that the punishment doesn't apply when the theft involves household goods. The chain includes Shāfiʿī and Mālik. The narrative involves ʿUbayd Allāh's slave and the theft of his master's wife's mirror. The translation process is now complete.

Detailing Fruit Theft Rulings

Currently focusing on the rules of cutting for fruit theft. A chapter title and two hadiths are being rendered. There is no cutting for hanging fruit, but it is applied if the fruit is in the drying floor. All chains are traced to the Prophet. The specific details around drying floors are now translated and assessed.

Analyzing Theft Exemptions

I'm now rendering the new chapter and its hadiths about fruit theft. I've translated the two hadiths which confirm that there's no cutting for stolen fruit or palm pith, following the Prophet's explicit statements. I'm focusing on the chains of transmission, specifically Mālik's narration through Yaḥyā b. Saʿīd and Sufyān's similar account. The translation is complete.

Resolving Legal Contradictions

I'm presently translating two hadiths discussing conflicting legal interpretations. I've rendered 'Ali b. Husayn's denial that the Prophet branded eyes or exceeded cutting hands/feet, contrasting with potentially contradicting narrations. I'm now translating the rules on highway robbers. This includes the differing punishments based on whether robbery was accompanied by killing or not.

Analyzing Robber Punishments

The current focus is on the Musnad's highway robbery punishments. I've translated Ibn ʿAbbās's detailed rules, differentiating between killing, taking wealth, and terrorizing, and the corresponding actions. Also, I've finished rendering the verses in the Quran and Shāfiʿī's agreement, and the interpretation that the Imam's choice of punishment is limited.

Detailing Homicide Rules

I've just translated the latest narrations concerning homicide, focusing on the rules prohibiting killing and the associated legal concepts. The chapter title, "That By Which Killing Becomes Prohibited," is rendered, along with the Basmala. All translation details have been double-checked for accuracy and consistency with previous chapters, with all chains of transmission preserved.

Reviewing Final Adjustments

I've just finished the final review and made the last formatting and typographical corrections. All hadith chains have been meticulously verified, terminology consistently checked, and the overall narrative flow polished for a refined translation. I am fully satisfied with the final output.
I'm currently focused on the specific Arabic segments and the nuanced requirements for the translation. Understanding the source text's legal context and the desired tone are vital. I'm prioritizing accuracy while considering stylistic choices that will make the translated text accessible and clear to English readers. The goal is to produce a translation that is both faithful to the original and understandable within the context of legal discourse.

Detailing Technical Precision

I'm now fully immersed in the nitty-gritty of the translation, focusing on accuracy at every level. This involves adhering to strict formatting protocols and meticulously handling technical Islamic terminology, such as the preservation of "Allah" and "ﷺ". I'm breaking down the text segment by segment, starting with C394 and P595a, ensuring alignment and precise translation. My iterative revision process, emphasizing alignment, contextual accuracy, and transliteration correctness, is fully underway.

Investigating Legal Nuances

I've been analyzing the legal implications of a man swearing perpetual abstinence. I'm focusing on the chains of narration from P595b onwards, particularly the concept of mūlī and the legal ruling of waqf. I am carefully reviewing the use of "yūqifu" and "awqafa," aiming to grasp the precise legal action of "halting" the husband. The different chains and narrations from companions are offering valuable perspectives. The comments by Shāfīʿī are also under review.

Analyzing Divorce Proceedings

Now I'm delving into the legal intricacies of divorce following a husband's vow of abstinence (īlā'). I'm focusing on the various chains of narration and the actions taken to resolve such situations. The narrations from ʿUthmān, ʿĀʾishah, Ibn ʿUmar, and ʿAlī highlight the process of compelling the husband to act, as well as the conditions that allow the wife to initiate divorce. The context of Quran 2:229 underscores the need for a just resolution.

Evaluating Khulʿ Stipulations

I'm now focusing on specific cases of divorce initiated by the wife, specifically khulʿ, which is compensation based. I'm analyzing the narrations involving Ḥabībah bint Sahl and her khulʿ from Thābit ibn Qays, paying close attention to the details of the compensation, including the phrase "All that he gave me is with me." I'm also examining how the Prophet's command influenced the outcome, and whether there are potential discrepancies between the narrations, particularly those involving beatings. I'm contrasting these cases with the khulʿ executed by Ṣafīyah bint Abī ʿUbayd, further investigating the legal parameters.

Assessing Divorce Authority

I'm presently focusing on the nuances of divorce pronouncements following khulʿ. The narration via Umm Bakrah al-Aslamīyah presents a case where the ruling hinges on whether specific compensation was named. The chapter C397 clearly delineates the husband's limited authority during the waiting period. Further, the chain from Ibn ʿAbbās and Ibn al-Zubayr clarifies the husband's inability to divorce after a woman has initiated khulʿ because he no longer has legal possession to divorce. The implications of this are very important.

Refining Divorce Rules

I am now closely examining the chapter on divorce of the Sunnah. I am breaking down the critical hadith from Ibn Umar detailing divorce during menstruation and the Prophet's specific corrective instructions for resumption and waiting periods. This helps clarify the legal implications of Quranic verse 2:228. I am also investigating variations in the narration chains, seeking clarity on the proper iddah procedures.

Deciphering Divorce Interpretations

Specifically, I'm analyzing the various readings of ṭalliqūhunna, including the li-qubul variation and the impact of different narrations of Ibn Umar. I'm examining how each chain, from Mujahid to Ibn Abbas, informs our understanding of the legality, counting, and the required actions following such pronouncements. I'm also reviewing the Bāb ṣarīḥ al-ṭalāq and its relation to multiple divorce pronouncements.

Revising Divorce Outcomes

Currently, I'm examining how triple divorce pronouncements were handled historically, specifically during the era of the Prophet, Abū Bakr, and the early years of ʿUmar. I'm focusing on key narrations, particularly those from Ibn ʿAbbās, which seem to suggest these pronouncements were initially considered as a single divorce. I'm analyzing the cases where the husbands have pronounced 100 divorces in a single instance and the implications. I am trying to understand the exact reasons for the historical context, given the different legal implications.

Exploring Divorce Consequences

My attention is now on the legal implications of triple divorce, particularly the varying interpretations within the narrations. I'm focusing on the dialogue between ʿAṭāʾ and ʿAbd Allāh ibn ʿAmr ibn al-ʿĀṣ regarding divorce pronouncements on a virgin, highlighting the concept of tabuttuhā. I'm also examining the legal validity of the triple divorce based on the chains in P608, and the verdicts reached, and I'm further reviewing the variations within P607a and P607b. I'm also taking note of Shāfīʿī's comments on the historical context.

Analyzing Marital Complications

I'm now diving into the complex legal issues surrounding Rifāʿah's wife, focusing on the nuanced narratives concerning impotence and the implications of irrevocable divorce. The Prophet's response regarding tasting "honey" is essential, and the variations between P609 and P610 highlight differing perspectives. I'm also starting to analyze the chapter on the divorce of slaves.

Investigating Divorce Regulations

I'm now analyzing the regulations governing divorce within the context of slave marriages, particularly focusing on the legal status of freed female slaves and their husbands. The narrations from Zayd ibn Thābit and ʿUthmān confirm the stricter limitations for slaves' divorce, which are critical. I'm also examining the legal implications of indirect divorce pronouncements, like al-khalīyah and al-barīyah, with the help of narrations from Ibn Umar. The concept of choice given to a manumitted female slave, as described in Barirah's case, is also an area of focus.

Reviewing Dowry Implications

I'm now investigating the legal ramifications of divorce before consummation, specifically concerning dowry and waiting periods. I'm focusing on the narrations from Ibn Abbas and Ibn Umar to clarify Quranic verses 2:237 and 33:49. The variations between the chains highlight nuances in the interpretations of these divorce scenarios. I'm also paying close attention to the chapter on who holds the "knot of marriage" for these cases.

Analyzing Dowry Settlements

I'm presently focusing on the nuances of dowry payments following divorce. I'm carefully reviewing specific narrations from different companions, including Abū Hurayrah and ʿUmar, and the interpretations of the Quranic verses 2:237 and 33:49. The variations between the chains provide critical context, and I'm giving special attention to cases where a divorcee remarries and is subsequently re-divorced, and what dower-related considerations must be made.

Deciphering Divorce Intent

I'm now analyzing the implications of al-battah divorce, particularly Rukānah's case, where the Prophet ﷺ interpreted his intention. I'm focusing on clarifying the precise meaning of "al-battah" in the narrative, and how intent is central to rulings, as highlighted by ʿUmar's interpretation in P622. The emphasis on revocable versus irrevocable divorce and the application of Quranic verses are also key here.

Examining Divorce Meanings

I'm now clarifying the implications of divorce. Particularly, I'm examining al-battah divorce, specifically Rukānah's case. I'm focusing on how intent determines the outcome. ʿUmar's clarification on the "single one" being sufficient highlights that. I'm also delving into P622a, P622b, and P622c, and chapter C412, all of which contribute to my understanding of the relevant rulings.

Evaluating Ownership Rights

I'm now analyzing the implications of a husband granting his wife ownership (mallaka). Specifically, I'm focusing on scenarios described in P623a and P624. I am weighing the differing rulings based on the husband's intent, and the wife's autonomy as emphasized by Zayd ibn Thābit. The subsequent chapters on waiting periods will be considered as part of the next phase.

Revising Legal Categories

I'm now integrating the remaining text segments (03a, P604, etc.) to refine the overall structure. I'm focusing on the legal categories across the text, ensuring a logical flow, especially considering C410 and the subsequent text. I am scrutinizing the implications of Basmalah (P620) within the legal discourse. The integration of all data points is nearly done, I will shortly move to complete analysis of the implications.

Analyzing Textual Alignment

I'm presently focusing on the structure of the text starting with C410. I've noted a segment without a specific ID but directly related to the concept of divorce and return, as mentioned by Al-Shafi'i. I'm choosing to interpret this as a continuation of C410's content, to maintain structural integrity. This section delves into legal details and its placement is key to my analysis.

Synthesizing Legal Narratives

I'm now integrating the final text segments, including P623a and P604c, focusing on the concepts of a husband granting ownership and the waiting period after divorce, especially for those never touched. I am examining Rukānah's case in conjunction with the concepts around single pronouncements. I'm focusing on refining legal interpretations.

Finalizing Interpretations

I'm solidifying my approach to translate the phrase al-wāḥidah tabutt, with a focus on its nuanced meaning in Rukānah's context and ʿUmar's interpretation. I'm focusing on "The single one makes [it] definitive" to convey the action of a single divorce. The translation needs to preserve the legal weight of the term, given that the wife returned in that narration.

Finalizing Legal Narratives

Now I'm focusing on the legal weight of al-wāḥidah tabutt, which means "The single one makes [it] definitive," as I solidify my translation approach. ʿUmar's interpretation is essential, as the emphasis is on the outcome of a definitive declaration. My final analysis draws on the full context of this narration and related narrations.

I'm focusing on their exceptional devotion, including Bilal's unwavering "Ahad, Ahad" under torture (P39616-P39617) and Abu Bakr freeing him (P39619). I've noted Umar's acknowledgment of Abu Bakr's act (P39620), and Bilal's place as a "forerunner" (P39622). Also, I'm now exploring narrations about Jarir ibn Abdullah, focusing on his prophesied arrival (P39625) and the Prophet's blessing (P39626).

I'm also examining the depiction of Qurayshi women (C5080, P39695-P39697).

Evaluating Companions' Narratives

Currently, I'm focusing on the narratives regarding the companions of the Prophet. I've translated narrations that discuss refraining from criticizing them, highlighting their virtues, such as being like salt in food, and emphasizing the importance of their generation. I've also incorporated prophecies regarding later generations and the significance of seeing those who saw the Prophet. I've included the perspectives of Ibn Umar and Sha'bi. I've shifted to Al-Madinah and translated its significance.

I've translated key hadiths, including those about curses on those who terrorize Madinah (P39724), Dajjal's proximity (P39725), and faith's retreat to Madinah (P39726). Moreover, I'm now refining the translations using Pass 3. This pass entails a rigorous transliteration check, encompassing names (Hishām ibn ‘Urwah, ‘Ā’ishah, etc.), and terms such as Ba'th, Ta'n, Mawla, Arsh, Sarir, Fitnah, and Sabran. I am using Allah for God and ﷺ for Prophet. Finally, I'm making sure to adhere to formatting guidelines.

Interpreting "Mawtah"

I'm now grappling with the precise interpretation of "Mawtah" in relation to Usamah's expedition. Despite my initial assumption of "death," I've confirmed from the provided Arabic text that "Mawtah" is the correct rendering. I'm focusing on accurately translating its connection to the expedition's timing, while acknowledging the potential historical ambiguity.

Resolving Verse Discrepancies

I'm now clarifying the handling of verse discrepancies. The reference to Al-Hujurat:5 for the verse {ادْعُوهُمْ لِآبَائِهِمْ هُوَ أَقْسَطُ عِنْدَ اللَّهِ} in the source is incorrect. Following the prompt's emphasis on accuracy, I'll translate the verse as provided and retain the [Al-Hujurat: 5] reference within the translation, adhering to a literal approach. I am focusing on the phrase "Hadhā al-ḥayy... miḥnah" (P39649), translating it to convey the concept that this tribe is a test of faith.

I've been defining the scope of the translation task, focusing on the critical constraints. I'm prioritizing the preservation of isnād chains and adherence to ALA-LC transliteration while accurately conveying the narrative, especially regarding the destruction of Jerusalem. I'm now wrestling with the balance between literal accuracy and accessibility for a modern audience.

Unpacking the Narratives

Now, I'm focusing on the layered narratives surrounding Jeremiah and the destruction of Jerusalem, specifically passages P3000, P3002, and P3005/3005a. I'm trying to unpack the symbolic weight of these events; the angel's visits and the 100-year revival have symbolic meaning I intend to explore. I'm focusing on deciphering the metaphors and the varying perspectives on the events. I'm considering the implications of differing narrations from Wahb b. Munabbih and Al-Suddī.

Dissecting Linguistic Nuances

I'm unpacking the grammatical debate on "Kam" (how long), the confusion over the time of day, and the varied interpretations of lam yatasannah. The discussion focuses on whether the 'h' is a radical or an affix, and its relation to "sanah" or "ḥama' masnūn". I'm also comparing varying readings, and Al-Ṭabarī's grammatical counterarguments regarding lam yatasannah.

Exploring Revival Narratives

My thoughts have now shifted to the revival of the donkey, and I am exploring the order and nature of its resurrection as portrayed in the text, including the question of whether its revival was witnessed or if it was already alive. I'm focusing on the narrations that describe the eyes being created first and the subsequent stages of the revival of the bones and flesh. The meaning of the sign for the people, that Jeremiah returned young while his children were old, is a key concern.

Refining Name Translations

I'm now refining the translations of key names and concepts. I'm focusing on "Al-Khaḍir," which appears in the text. While it could refer to Jeremiah in some Isrā'īliyyāt, the text specifically states Al-Khaḍir. I've noted that while I'll translate it as Al-Khaḍir to stay faithful to the provided text, the reference might allude to Jeremiah's traditional association with Khidr. Furthermore, I've corrected "sannḥārīb" to Sennacherib and reviewed the ALA-LC transliteration of the narrators. The analysis now centers on segment P3000, including the appearance of an angel and the concept of "fatwā" which I've translated to "legal ruling." Also, I'm noting the translation for "sakhata" as anger/wrath and the description of Nebuchadnezzar's invasion.

Charting Textual Variations

I'm now delving into the specific textual segments, like P3002, focusing on key elements. I'm carefully considering insertions of Quranic verses, especially 2:259, and analyzing phrases like "lam yatasannah" and "nunshizuhā." I'm now also looking at P3012, to see Ubayy b. Ka'b's reading and the writing on the shoulder blade of a sheep.

Examining Revival Details

I'm now fully immersed in the details of the donkey's revival. I'm unpacking the implications of "Did not change" versus "Did not stink" regarding its state, and analyzing Tabari's preference for a witnessed resurrection. I'm focusing on the sequential revival, from skull ("jumjumah") to bones ("alīf") and flesh, in the specific segments. The symbolic weight of Jeremiah's youthful return compared to his children's aging is also a key point I'm exploring.

Synthesizing Narrative Components

I've completed my analysis of the donkey's revival narrative and all the related segments and narrations in Tabari's Tafsir. Now, I'm integrating this analysis with my contextual understanding, specifically focusing on the respectful translation of religious phrases like Jalla Thanā'uhu and 'Azza wa Jalla. Also, the angel's query for a "fatwā" requires a specific legal ruling. I am ready to begin the final synthesis.

Defining Proper Nouns

I'm presently focused on the accurate translation of proper nouns, including the various names for Jerusalem (Bayt al-Maqdis, Īliyā'). I'm also ensuring the linguistic debate around "yatasannah" is clearly explained. I've noted the transliteration of all the names. Also, I've decided to use standard English forms for Biblical figures like Jeremiah, but strictly follow ALA-LC for narrators to ensure clarity and consistency.

Integrating Cultural Context

My focus has shifted to the integration of cultural context, particularly religious phrases and historical references, within the translation. I'm prioritizing accuracy in translating the angel's question about the fatwā. I'm also ensuring all the Arabic words are translated into English with their proper English meanings. My aim is to make the work understandable for a modern audience without losing the original cultural meanings.

Translating Religious Terms

I'm now fully immersed in the nuances of religious terms, especially the distinction between "God" and "Allah". I'm carefully reviewing the verse translations, specifically Annā yuḥyī hādhihi Allāhu baʿda mawtihā. I've also noted and corrected Nebuchadnezzar's name as well as an anecdote in P3012 involving Ubayy b. Ka'b. My focus is now on the output, ready for the draft.

I'm starting the translation of the Arabic jurisprudence text. My focus is on accuracy and clarity, ensuring the nuances of the original are preserved. Currently, I'm immersed in understanding the legal terminology and structure. I am setting up the initial glossary and identifying the key terms and phrases for consistent translation throughout the passage.

Refining Translation Strategy

I've established the initial glossary and am deeply familiarizing myself with the legal structure of Fatāwá al-Hindīyyah. The translation strategy prioritizes absolute fidelity to the original text, while retaining the nuanced meanings of Hanafi jurisprudence. I am also making sure I adhere to the requested special considerations related to technical terminology and Arabic characters in the translation. I'm focusing on ensuring accuracy as I work.

Clarifying Terminology Usage

Formatting will be plain text with the mandated "ﷺ" and ID retention.

Assessing Narrator Reliability

I'm now deep-diving into the reliability of narrators within the isnads. Al-Nasāʾī's assessment of "Thiqah" (trustworthy) is key. The subsequent chain reveals the nuanced viewpoints on the importance of adhering to traditional narrations versus rational speculation. I need to understand this better.

Analyzing Nuance in Comparison

I'm now grappling with this significant comparison. This dream-like perspective on Aḥmad ibn Ḥanbal versus Aḥmad ibn Shabawayh offers such deep insight. The dream highlights the inmīḥna (trial) of Ibn Ḥanbal, something Shabawayh didn't experience. This perspective is shifting my understanding of relative merit. I'll need to explore this further, particularly considering Ibn Mākūlā's death dates.

Confirming Narrator Identities

I'm now carefully examining the contrasting accounts surrounding Aḥmad ibn Shabawayh's death. Multiple sources provide varying details, including those from Abū Ḥātim and Al-Bukhārī. I'm focusing on discrepancies in dates and the challenge of identifying the correct Aḥmad ibn Muḥammad ibn Thābit ibn Shabawayh. Dāraquṭnī's confirmation helps, but Kalābādhī's perspective provides an alternative that I'll have to investigate in parallel. Ultimately, regardless of the discrepancies, I've confirmed they are thiqah (trustworthy).

Investigating Lineage Details

I am currently investigating the lineage details of narrators, specifically focusing on the corrections and attributions provided by source materials. For instance, I've had to correct the initial assumed name "Aḥmad ibn Muḥammad ibn Jaʿfar" to "Muḥammad ibn Aḥmad ibn Jaʿfar" based on detailed references and alternative sources. I'm also confirming the validity of biographical information, such as locations and dates, for each narrator I encounter. This is critical for accurately mapping the isnads.

Charting Narrator Journeys

I'm now tracing the travels of narrators within the isnad. I've logged the locations of ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ibn Mahdī, confirming his extensive travels to Kufa, Basra, Mecca, Medina, Yemen, Sham, and Jazira. I'm focusing on the significant implications of these locations on the dissemination and reliability of the narratives. Currently transliterating all names for precision.

Mapping the Isnad Network

I'm now carefully logging the relationships between narrators. Focusing on their connections, I'm noting direct narrations, particularly from those labeled with ṣ d, like Abū Saʿīd. I'm cross-referencing sources to ensure accurate identification and disambiguation, especially concerning narrators with common names, like Yaḥyā ibn Maʿīn - making sure to clarify which Yaḥyā is intended, as the text contains multiple options. I'm also paying close attention to the chains to identify the direct narrations.

Tracking Lineage Connections

I'm presently tracing the lineages of narrators to verify precise connections within the isnads. I've identified several key figures, including Muḥammad ibn Dāwūd al-Maṣṣīṣī, Muḥammad ibn Yaḥyā al-Dhuhlī, and Muḥammad ibn Abī Ghālib al-Qūmisī. I'm focusing on lineage corrections from al-Dūrī and Abū Bakr ibn Abī Dāwūd, and correcting lineage data with a long chain from Ibn Aḥmad. Discrepancies on Dhuhl ibn Shaybān are the focus, and I am cross-referencing to determine if it is Shaybān ibn Dhuhl or Dhuhl ibn Shaybān.

Reconciling Discrepancies

I'm now carefully reconciling apparent chronological contradictions within the text regarding Ahmad's travels. I have noted the seemingly conflicting information about Ahmad ibn Hanbal's initial arrival in Basra, specifically the distinction between "First Rajab 180" and "year 86." I am meticulously re-examining the original text to clarify this date and travel timeline discrepancy.

Tracing Chronological Anomalies

I'm now deeply analyzing the chronological sequence of events, especially those concerning Ahmad's journeys and encounters. I've noted a potential discrepancy: "year 180" for entering Basra, following mentions of Kufa and Imam Malik's death in 179. I'm carefully cross-referencing this with other sources, noting dates of Hajj in 187 and the implied stay in San'a in 199. I'm focusing on Imam Malik's death and Abdul Razzaq's timeline and the expenditure details for these events.

Collecting Aḥmad's Praises

I'm now collating the commendations and anecdotes surrounding Aḥmad ibn Ḥanbal. I'm noting the financial hardship he faced, and how his peers, like Ismāʿīl ibn ʿUlayyah and people in Kufa, respected him deeply. I'm focusing on the descriptions of him in his youth, including the esteem Yaḥyā ibn Saʿīd showed, even when Ibn al-Shādhakūnī criticized him. I'm also cataloging the interactions between Yaḥyā and Yazīd ibn Hārūn and Ibn Mahdī's approval.

Synthesizing Praises and Comparisons

I'm now integrating the many commendations of Aḥmad ibn Ḥanbal, including the esteem he received from contemporaries. The comparative analysis with scholars like Yaḥyā ibn Maʿīn and Alī ibn al-Madīnī is revealing. I'm noting the specific details: Yaḥyā's deep knowledge and Alī's impressive memory, while Aḥmad is praised for his piety and expertise. I'm focusing on the range of these accolades.

Summarizing Aḥmad's Esteem

I'm now collating comprehensive praise for Aḥmad ibn Ḥanbal. I've noted direct quotes from Al-Shāfiʿī, his father's high regard, and the powerful statement on saving Islam. Al-Madīnī's comparison to Abū Bakr, Al-Nufaylī's "distinct figure" label, and Al-ʿIjlī's detailed accolades are central. I'm prioritizing their impact.

Evaluating Acclaim of Ahmad

I am synthesizing all these praises for Aḥmad ibn Ḥanbal. I'm focusing on Muhannā's comparison to Sufyān and Wakīʿ, the "proof" designation from both Fuḍayl and Al-Haytham ibn Jamīl, and Abū ʿUbayd's ranking. The trial's impact is significant, and the Prophet's parallel is a key factor. The accolades from Naṣr ibn Ali and the parallel about Israelites are the critical focus.

Analyzing Scholarly Esteem

I'm now integrating the praise for Ahmad from contemporary scholars. The detailed accounts from al-Dārimī, al-Muqrīʾ, and Ibn Abī Ḥātim are particularly enlightening. The strong statements comparing him to earlier prophets and the emphasis on him embodying the Sunnah highlight his significance. The careful documentation of these accolades will be crucial.

Deciphering Code Meanings

I'm now clarifying the codes within the text, focusing on the meaning behind each symbol in their context. Initially translating the Arabic letters directly to their ALA-LC equivalents, and investigating the coded references. I will confirm the codes for ṣ d (s d), l, and other lesser-used codes. The goal is to accurately translate and understand each code's function within the text.

Refining Textual Accuracy

I'm now carefully reviewing and revising the text for precision. I've standardized "ibn" usage per protocol and confirmed the "Miḥnah" context. I am double-checking translations of specific Arabic phrases and ensuring their correct interpretation. This includes phrases such as "died in Tarsus," and "black-headed." I'm also addressing the confusion between narrators, specifically around P395.

Confirming Chronological Order

I am currently investigating the chronological order of events related to Aḥmad ibn Ḥanbal, specifically the first mention of his arrival in Basra. Reconciling "180" and "86" is crucial, and the textual evidence should be carefully reviewed. I'm focusing on validating which date aligns with the overall narrative and establishing the correct entry date. I'm also ensuring the correct translation.

Interpreting Semantic Ambiguity

I'm now carefully navigating this tricky textual quirk regarding Aḥmad ibn Ḥanbal. The Arabic explicitly states "they were both Sadūsīs," referencing both Qatādah and Aḥmad, which is a known inaccuracy. I'm focusing on the implied meaning, rather than a literal interpretation, since the claim is clearly not factual. The narrative may be designed for a specific purpose.

Translating Ambiguous Phrases

I'm now carefully navigating these textual phrases, particularly the nuanced statements about "Sadūsīs." The explicit claim, despite inaccuracy, will be transcribed literally. The two contradicting dates, 180 and 86, will be retained as is, following the original text. I am also making progress on checking isnads and verifying precise translations of complex terms like samd.
I've been meticulously analyzing the user's request, focusing on the source language and subject matter. It's becoming clearer that we're dealing with Arabic, specifically a scholarly context within Islamic Studies, so the target is English. This Jarḥ wa Taʿdīl aspect needs careful consideration for an accurate translation.

Focusing on Precision

I'm now fully immersed in the meticulous work of translating segment by segment. The constraints are guiding every decision. I'm prioritizing preserving identifiers (like P416), adhering to the literal meaning where possible, and ensuring the technical Jarḥ wa Taʿdīl terms are flawlessly rendered. The codes and chains of narration are also meticulously being preserved in the requested format. I've begun with the Ibn Abī Ḥātim quote about Aḥmad b. Ḥanbal, and am checking the IDs thoroughly.

Exploring Narrative Elements

I'm now delving into the biographical details, aiming for a smooth narrative flow. I've noted Aḥmad's significant acts of worship, his ascetic lifestyle, and intriguing incidents in Mecca. The accounts from Makkah and Al-ʿAskar are particularly revealing. The interactions with figures like ʿAbd al-Razzāq highlight his character.

Uncovering Resilience Themes

I'm presently focusing on the narratives of Ahmad's forbearance amid adversity. The refusal of financial assistance, like the merchant's 10,000 dirhams and Al-Jārūdī's offer, is striking. Al-Anbārī's counsel and Ahmad's emotional response are poignant, highlighting his role as a spiritual guide. I'm also examining the vivid accounts of his flogging and the encouraging prison encounter, highlighting his strength and conviction. I'm further reviewing his theological discussions in prison.

Highlighting Key Interactions

I'm presently focusing on the key interactions, especially Ahmad's encounter with the Governor, where they challenge the accusations and are subsequently freed from fetters. Al-Bukhārī's commentary adds a layer of depth. I'm also examining the prophetic story from Al-Khiḍr and the angels, as well as Hilāl's comparison of Ahmad to other pillars of the Ummah.

Documenting Final Moments

Now I'm delving into the accounts of Ahmad's death and funeral. I'm noting the specific dates, like Friday, the 12th of Rabīʿ al-Ākhar, 241 AH, and his age of 77. The massive funeral attendance estimates are truly staggering, with figures ranging from 800,000 to over 2.5 million mourners. The poignant quote about innovation and funerals resonates deeply. The reported conversions and the dream about light on graves add layers of significance to this final chapter. Finally, the dream of the Prophet ﷺ speaking of his truthfulness under testing is a compelling closing.

Expanding Biographical Data

I'm now integrating the additional biographical entries, including details on al-Sijistānī's observation of Ahmad, specifically his distribution of seals. The dream and subsequent concluding assessment are also being incorporated, with the lā ba's bih assessment being added. I'm noting the teachers and students for each new entry and the assessments, like thiqah and ṣadūq where applicable, expanding our knowledge of these key figures.

Incorporating Additional Details

I've just added several more biographical entries: Al-Nasā'ī's lā ba's bih assessment for a key figure from 235 AH is now included, alongside entries for Aḥmad b. Muḥammad b. Nayzak (Al-Ṭūsī), with a death date of 248 AH, and another Al-Qūmisī who passed in 275 AH. I've also incorporated the famous companion of Aḥmad b. Ḥanbal, Al-Athram. These new details are enriching the historical context.

Integrating Further Biographical Data

I'm presently incorporating further biographical elements, including assessments of individuals mentioned and detailed information on teachers and students. Specifically, I'm now documenting the lā ba's bih assessment of a significant figure from 235 AH, along with a new entry on Aḥmad b. Muḥammad b. al-Walīd al-Azraqī, who was active in 217 AH, whose grandfather was the historian. I'm focusing on preserving any relevant assessments, especially on his teachers.

Analyzing New Entries

I'm now integrating the recent biographical data for ʿAwn (Al-Qawwās), noting his teachers and student (Qunbul), and confirming his approximate death date (~230 AH). I've also added the bio for Aḥmad b. Muḥammad b. Yaḥyā... Al-Qaṭṭān, the brother of Ṣāliḥ. I'm focusing on ensuring accuracy with biographical elements, and I am preparing for the final phase of refinement and formatting.

Reviewing the Assessments

I'm currently focused on the meticulous review of assessments, especially the lā ba's bih designations. I've noted that "no harm in him" often equals ṣadūq, and I'm cross-referencing this. My immediate priority is confirming the accuracy of all IDs like P416 through P442, paying careful attention to duplicates like C435 (Tamyīz) and P435 (Al-Athram) to prevent any errors. I am now meticulously verifying all assessments and identifiers.

Completing Final Touches

I'm now putting the finishing touches on the entire process. I'm carefully reviewing all names and codes, ensuring consistency with ALA-LC standards. I'm meticulously checking the translation of verse content, and confirming that the provided instructions on chapter headings have been followed. I'm also ensuring the correct rendering of the chains of narration, particularly the P437 update regarding Al-Athram.

Analyzing Quranic References

I'm presently focusing on the Quranic references within the text. I've successfully incorporated the verses concerning the nature of God, specifically "There is nothing like unto Him" and "and He is the Hearing, the Seeing". I've paid careful attention to the phrase "creation of the Qur'an" and its context. The term "trial/tribulation" from the original text has been carefully translated to its proper equivalent in the translation. I am now in the final stage of refining and ready for submission.


I've been meticulously analyzing the user's request, focusing on identifying the critical nuances inherent in translating Islamic content, particularly Hadith. I'm prioritizing accuracy and cultural sensitivity. My current focus is on understanding the implicit and explicit demands that can arise from this context, and applying my current knowledge base to the task, starting with the Hadith content.

Implementing Translation Guidelines

I'm now integrating the provided translation guidelines. I'm prioritizing the established rules, such as using "Allah" and maintaining precise technical terminology like "Jarh wa Ta'dil". I am meticulously ensuring the target audience's needs are met, striving for high accuracy with literal translations, unless the context necessitates a meaning-based approach. The formatting requirements, like the plain text format and preservation of IDs and Isnad chains, are also taking precedence.

Refining Isnad and Text

I'm currently refining the translation of the Isnad and text. The Isnad translation is being meticulously examined, paying close attention to technical terms like Isnad Sahih and Rijal Thiqat. I'm also addressing the nuances of the text's core message. I'm focusing on "playing with his arrows" in the sentence "You will conquer lands... let not one of you fail to play with his arrows," ensuring the correct meaning of "train" is conveyed. I'm prioritizing accuracy in proper names, conforming to ALA-LC standards. Finally, I've started the translation of the chapter title, "C2899: باب في من يغزو ويلتمس الدنيا," which will be "Chapter regarding the one who goes on a military expedition and seeks..."

Analyzing Contextual Implications

I'm now thoroughly examining the content of Hadith P2899, focusing on the two types of Ghazw described and their contrasting outcomes. My priority is accurately conveying the motivations and consequences outlined, paying close attention to the distinctions between seeking Allah's favor and worldly gain. I am also carefully considering Albani's comment on the Isnad, and the implications of Baqiyah ibn al-Walid's transmission. The content of P2900 and P2900a is also under scrutiny.

Translating Additional Hadith

I've moved on to Hadith P2901, P2901a, and P2902. I'm focusing on accurately rendering the Isnad chains for these narrations, including the names of the narrators, such as al-Rabī‘ ibn Nāfi‘, and ensuring their correct Arabic form. I've translated the chapter title for C2901 and will soon address Abu Musa's dialogue on motivations for fighting. I'm prioritizing conveying the central message about fighting for Allah's word and the implications of striving for worldly gain versus seeking divine approval. I am taking note of the Albani grading of the narration as Sahih.

Progressing with Martyrdom

I'm now fully immersed in the details of Chapter C2903, "Chapter regarding the virtue of martyrdom." The essence of Hadith P2903, with Ibn 'Abbas narrating the story of the Uhud martyrs, is currently being considered. I'm focusing on the descriptions of their spiritual state and the verse that confirms their blessed status, with consideration for the Albani grading and narrator biographies. My translation of P2904 and P2904a are next, including noting the differences between versions of the hadith.

Analyzing Further Narrations

I'm now focusing on additional narrations. I've begun to translate P2905, translating it as: "And it has many well-known supporting witnesses..." I am also focusing on the chapter C2905, titled "Chapter: The martyr intercedes." Finally, I am examining the content and Isnad of P2905a, narrated by Nimran ibn 'Utbah, with Umm al-Darda' as the source. I'm focusing on the translation, including how to describe the witness. I will consider the Albani grading for this narration.

Expanding My Focus

I'm now diving into narrations P2906, P2906a, C2906, P2907, and C2907. I'm addressing name corrections, like Walid ibn Rabah, and translating the chapter title about the light at a martyr's grave. P2906a is very interesting, with focus on the prayer difference between martyrs and those who lived longer. I'm focusing on the Albani grading and names, too. Now I'm preparing to translate the chapter title about making gifts for the fighting.

Exploring Additional Hadith

I'm presently translating narrations P2907a, P2908, P2908a, and the related chapter titles. I've translated chapter C2907a and chapter C2908, with focus on the wages for fighting. I'm prioritizing accuracy for names, like the narrators, and adhering to the Albani grading for the Isnad Sahih. P2908a is interesting, with focus on the older man hiring someone.

Analyzing Current Hadith

I'm now focusing on P2909, P2909a, and C2909. The translation will accurately represent the man's situation and will convey the Prophet's instructions about the man's parents' displeasure. Accurate representation of the Isnad chain, the Albani grading, and technical terms like "Sā’ib" is essential. The core theme regarding parental consent in religious obligations is also being assessed.

Translating New Narrations

I'm translating P2910 and P2910a, with a focus on Al-Albani's notes on Al-Sa'ib and the Sahih grading. P2910a's focus on striving through parental care and name accuracy for Ḥabīb ibn Abī Thābit is key. I'm now proceeding to P2911, and the implications of parental permission for fighting are central. P2911a and C2911 is next, dealing with women's roles.

Examining the New Content

I'm now fully immersed in the new set of Hadith. The chapter regarding expedition with unjust Imams has no direct hadith. Chapter C2912a, which focuses on a man supported by another's wealth for a military expedition, is being carefully translated, alongside P2912a, where the Prophet ﷺ calls for financial support for those without means. I'm prioritizing accuracy for names like Nubayḥ al-‘Anazī, and paying close attention to Albani's grading. I'm carefully translating P2913, including the Isnad. I've also translated C2913, focusing on a man seeking reward and spoils.

Translating P2913a and Further

I'm now translating P2913a, focusing on Ibn Zughb al-Iyadi and 'Abd Allah ibn Hawalah al-Azdi's account of a failed expedition and the Prophet's supplication. I'm prioritizing accuracy in conveying the Prophet's words and the Albani grading. I'll translate the important names and continue to C2915, regarding martyrdom, paying close attention to Isnad and text. Then, I'll translate P2915, involving Ibn Mas'ud's powerful story.

Refining Narrative Translations

I'm translating the last hadith, P2916a, with careful attention to nuance and flow, ensuring the story's dramatic impact is preserved. I'm focusing on the conversion of Amr ibn Uqaysh, and the story of fighting for Allah, without a full prayer. Albani's grading and names are being noted, along with C2917, about someone dying with their weapons. I am progressing with accuracy.

Progressing Through Final Narrations

I'm now fully translating P2917, P2918, C2918, and P2918a. I'm focusing on the tragic story of Salamah's brother, accurately conveying the Prophet's ﷺ declaration that he was a martyr. Albani's grading and the names, like Salamah ibn al-Akwa‘, are under scrutiny. The focus now turns to P2918 and C2918. Finally, I am focused on the supplication at battle, the narration of Sahl ibn Sa'd.

Analyzing the Last Section

I'm now fully immersed in the final section. My focus is on P2919 and C2919. I'm carefully translating the chapter title and the narration, which is from Rizq ibn Sa'id, about asking Allah for martyrdom. I am paying close attention to the Isnad, while also analyzing the source material for P2919a and C2921, examining the names listed. The focus is on ensuring the accurate representation of the information.

Examining Horse Hadith

I've moved on to examining the Hadith concerning horses, focusing on their tails, manes, and forelocks. I'm translating the narrations from 'Utbah and Ibn 'Abbas, adhering to the Albani grading and paying close attention to the names, especially in the Isnad chains. The chapter title about horse colors is also being addressed.

Prioritizing Horse Hadith

Now, I'm focusing on the Hadith about horses, particularly P2924, P2924a, and the linked chapters C2924 and C2925. The translation of chapter titles and names, like Marwān ibn Mu‘āwiyah, are central. I'm focusing on "Shikal" and addressing any errors in names, while maintaining Albani's grading. I'm prioritizing accuracy.

Analyzing Horse Narratives

I'm now fully translating P2926, P2926a, P2927, and P2927a, focusing on the details of animal care. The emphasis is on translating the Isnad and textual content accurately, while adhering to the Albani grading for each narration. The compassion shown by the Prophet to animals is the focus of P2926a and P2927a. The names, especially in the Isnad, are under scrutiny.

Focusing on Animal Care

I've been meticulously translating P2928, the corresponding chapter titles, and associated narrations, covering the essential aspects of caring for animals, as exemplified by the Prophet's ﷺ practices. I'm focusing on the Isnad, including precise identification of narrators like Ḥamzah al-Ḍabbī. I'm now examining the chapter on halting places. I am translating the chapter about bowstrings on horses and the related Sahih narrations. I have also translated the message about cutting off evil eye protections on camel necks, while also examining the relevant technical details.

Reviewing Final Adjustments

I'm now implementing the final adjustments to ensure overall quality. I'm focusing on consistency in capitalization, terminology, and formatting, particularly for technical terms. I've re-examined the transliteration of names and ensured accurate renderings of the text's core message. I am now examining Hadith P2930a, focusing on the angel's aversion to bells and the angel's presence. I am also reexamining names.

Addressing Lingering Nuances

I'm now engaged in resolving remaining lexical ambiguities, with a keen focus on precise terminology. The core of my current effort centers on refining the translation of phrases in P2898. Specifically, I've prioritized the accurate rendering of "practice with his arrows" within the context of Jihad, opting for the more literal "play/amuse himself with his arrows" to preserve the intended nuanced meaning. Concurrently, I've confirmed that a literal translation of "make them laugh" is fitting in P2909a. I'm focusing on "Died striving, a mujahid" to ensure its accurate portrayal in P2917, and "Dumb beasts" is confirmed as mu'jamah.

I've been meticulously analyzing the user's initial request. I'm focusing intently on their defined role and the specific domain of expertise, aiming to establish a clear framework for the subsequent steps. This careful analysis is crucial to ensure alignment with the requested translation style.

Developing Translation Protocols

I'm now deep-diving into the translation methodology, specifically for Irshād al-Fuḥul. I've refined the approach to be faithful to the text, prioritising a literal style when possible but adapting for clarity when needed. Crucially, I'm focusing on the precise use of Islamic terminology. I'm also implementing the specific requirements, such as maintaining narrator names, translating the chains of narrations, and respecting the specific abbreviations and character limits. The review process is going to involve three rigorous passes to verify alignment, context and accuracy, and transliteration.

Assessing Counterarguments

I'm currently engaged with the nuances of al-‘Anbarī and al-Jāḥiẓ's counterpoints, specifically concerning those disagreeing with Islamic truths. I'm focusing on the refutation methods used, including the appeal to consensus and the critique of their positions as irrational or negating legal obligations. I'm carefully analyzing the arguments from the text, Sunnah, and consensus that are brought forth to challenge these viewpoints.

Delving Deeper into Nuances

I'm now grappling with specific viewpoints on Ijtihad. I'm focusing on al-Shawkānī's argument concerning delving into potentially harmful issues and examining the stance of Dāwūd b. ‘Alī al-Aṣfahānī. I've noted the interpretation of al-‘Anbarī and al-Jāḥiẓ's positions, considering al-Ghazālī's view. Furthermore, I'm examining Ibn Daqīq al-‘Īd's analysis, differentiating between universal correctness and excusing sincere effort. The discussion around "Fundamental beliefs" (Qaṭ‘iyyāt) and the implications for those mistaken in such matters, including the Anthropomorphists (Mujassimah), is key, with a subtle examination on declaring them as disbelievers.

Exploring Takfīr Perspectives

I'm now engaged in the diverse perspectives on Takfīr. The central point of analysis is the two main viewpoints on declaring others as disbelievers. Specifically, I am focusing on al-Ash‘arī’s shift, the nuanced position of Abū Sahl al-Ṣu‘lūkī, and the Shāfi‘ī stance as narrated by Imām al-Ḥaramayn. The core challenge is balancing scholarly debate with the danger of erroneous Takfīr, which the scholars in question cautioned against.

Delineating Legal Ramifications

Now, I'm examining the legal divisions within Ilm al-Kalām, specifically focusing on the categorization of legal issues. This includes the distinction between definitively established matters, known by necessity, and those established by definitive proof but not "known by necessity". I'm meticulously analyzing the implications of error in these areas, including the potential for sin and the varying approaches to such errors, as well as the varying implications of these errors, including implications for Takfīr. I'm also delving into Ibn al-Sa‘ānī's position, as it's written.

Evaluating Juristic Divergence

I'm now unpacking the nuances of juristic disagreement regarding issues lacking definitive proof. I'm focusing on the contrasting views of al-Ash'arī, the Mu'tazilah, and the majority of jurists, including Imams like Abū Ḥanīfah and Mālik. I'm analyzing the implications of each stance, particularly concerning the concepts of truth and correctness in matters of Islamic Law, and how these impact the overall framework.

Comparing Scholarly Disagreements

I'm now comparing the nuanced viewpoints surrounding juristic disagreements, specifically those where definitive proof is lacking. I've begun to analyze the Shāfi‘ī school's stance, alongside perspectives from the Ẓāhirīs and the Mu'tazilah, focusing on their varying implications regarding truth and correctness within Islamic Law. The underlying principle, whether truth is singular or varied, is what I'm currently wrestling with.

Analyzing Nuances of Truth

I'm now closely examining the implications of differing interpretations regarding the Hadith on judges, specifically focusing on the concept of singular versus multiple truths. I'm unpacking the implications of the judge's reward, differentiating it from correctness, and analyzing various viewpoints, including the rejection of "everyone is correct" as erroneous. The Hadith, "Judges are three," and the instruction to commanders are also vital components, as they are used to support this viewpoint.

Analyzing Truth Arguments

I'm now critically examining the arguments against the idea of singular truth, specifically regarding the stories of David/Solomon, the palm tree verse, and the Banū Qurayẓah incident. The focus is on the textual analysis of these points and the interpretation of Iṣābah (correctness) versus Ṣawāb (rewardable action). I'm also engaging with al-Ṣafī al-Hindī's perspectives on these matters, specifically in the context of Islamic legal thought.

Revisiting Legal Principles

I'm now back at the core legal principles, specifically addressing cases where definitive textual evidence is absent. I'm carefully analyzing the conditions for sinfulness when a judge can't find relevant texts, looking at whether it's due to negligence or genuine scholarly effort. I'm also delving into the nuanced debate about the correctness or error of the judge's conclusions in these scenarios, and its relationship to divine decree. The viewpoints of various schools of thought, including the Ash‘arī and Mu‘tazilah positions, are being closely compared.

Analyzing Divergent Positions

I'm now focusing on the permissibility of a Mujtahid having contradictory rulings on a single issue. The core principle is that it's impossible for someone to hold contradictions simultaneously. However, if the proofs are equal, a suspension of judgment is required. The key is in combining, or if that is not possible, weighing them. I've noted that rulings can change over time due to new Ijtihad. I'm also grappling with the implications of varying fatwas based on individual circumstances and the inability of a judge to undo a ruling.

Synthesizing Complex Concepts

I'm now integrating the intricacies of delegating Ijtihad. I've progressed to exploring the delegation of judgment, specifically whether Allah could direct a scholar to solely judge with truth, examining opposing viewpoints. The crucial distinction is whether the delegation is for Ijtihad, which is agreed upon, or a broad delegation to rule however they wish, which sparks the disagreement. I'm focusing on the Mu'tazilah, Shāfi‘ī and other perspectives.

Examining the Core Concepts

I'm now deeply analyzing the arguments against the possibility of a scholar being delegated to judge without restriction. The core of my analysis is the weakness of the argument, given the varying paths within Sharia and the scholar's inherent Ẓann. I'm also grappling with the idea of a scholar as being bound by duty. The arguments using the verse on Bani Isra'il and the Prophet's ﷺ prompt actions provide critical examples, but the response clarifies the need for caution in attributing such possibilities to Allah regarding scholars.

Clarifying Taklid's Definition

I'm now zeroing in on defining Taqlīd within the context of legal discourse. I'm carefully sifting through definitions, analyzing the implications of each, and differentiating them from related concepts. I've noted the exclusion of reliance on prophetic pronouncements and consensus from the scope of Taqlīd, and am evaluating the utility of the refined definition, which underscores the absence of supporting proof.

Revisiting Taqlīd Definitions

I'm now refining my understanding of Taqlīd, differentiating the Mufti from the Mustafti, and understanding that following the Prophet's ﷺ sayings isn't considered Taqlīd because it is the proof. I am reconciling the varying opinions of al-Qāḍī Ḥusayn, al-Zarkashī, Imām al-Ḥaramayn, and Ibn Daqīq al-‘Īd, including the semantic dispute. Currently, I'm analyzing the consensus that following the Prophet ﷺ is based on knowledge, not Taqlīd, and now diving into the implications of Taqlīd in subsidiary legal matters.

Addressing Ibn al-Sa‘ānī Debate

I'm now wrestling with the nuanced debate surrounding Taqlīd and Ijtihad. I'm focused on the positions of Mālik and al-Shāfi‘ī, noting that the latter prohibited imitation. I'm analyzing al-Sam‘ānī's position, as it appears in the text, and considering the implications of differing interpretations. I'm carefully parsing the arguments of Ibn Ḥazm and those who consider it obligatory. I've noted the debate around whether consensus exists, and I'm further refining the translations.

Finalizing Translation Accuracy

I'm now fully immersed in the final stage, meticulously ensuring the accuracy and consistency of the translation. I've focused on crucial corrections, like the appropriate use of "fault" over the older translation and refining the handling of Allah's rulings. Also, I have a very meticulous approach to transliteration, and I've reviewed chapter headings and ensured the correct use of "Allah" and "ﷺ".

Refining Terminology Choices

I'm now meticulously scrutinizing the finer points of terminology, specifically the use of "Mustafti" versus "Fatwa-seeker" and the crucial translation of "Khārijah ‘an ḥadd al-ḥaṣr". I've decided to maintain "Mustafti" with clarification, and am leaning towards "Beyond enumeration" for "Khārijah ‘an ḥadd al-ḥaṣr". I'm also double-checking the accuracy of phrases like the palm tree verse and the specific wording concerning the Prophet's ﷺ instructions.

Adjusting for Clarity

I'm presently revising the translation of "Taqlīd," focusing on the balance between technical accuracy and accessibility. I'm choosing "Seeker of a ruling" in specific contexts and continuing with "Mustafti" to maintain the pair with "Mufti." I've corrected errors, incorporated feedback on specific terms, and am paying extra attention to the details, like the correct format of "ﷺ" and "Ibn al-Sa‘ānī." My final review focuses on precision and clarity.

I'm currently focused on the initial analysis of this translation request. I've identified the source as Musnad al-Shāfīʿī, the target language as English, and my role as a professional specializing in Islamic content. This foundational understanding will guide my approach moving forward, ensuring accuracy and appropriate terminology.

Developing Translation Guidelines

I've established meticulous guidelines for the translation. Accuracy is paramount, leaning towards literal translation unless clarity necessitates idiomatic phrasing. I've documented the need to preserve identifiers, full isnads, and implement ALA-LC transliteration for narrator names. Specific rules for divine names, narration terms, and other Islamic conventions are now in place. I've also decided to include chapter headings and translate any poetry.

Clarifying Narrative Details

I'm now diving into the nuances of Al-Miqdād's narration. I've reconstructed the specific scenario: a disbeliever severs Al-Miqdād's hand, then professes Islam while hiding behind a tree. The Prophet's response, emphasizing the sanctity of the convert's life, forms the core of this section. I'm focusing on the ethical dilemma and the legal ruling it establishes. I've also begun drafting the Arabic text.

Interpreting Prophetic Sayings

I'm now grappling with the Prophet's ﷺ profound responses to the questions about the convert. I've drafted preliminary translations, focusing on the dialogue's essence: the affirmation of faith versus the lack of acceptance. I'm focusing on the ethical implications and drafting accordingly. I've also incorporated the alternative narration about the hypocrite, and am striving to capture the specific nuance. I'm carefully comparing the different versions to ensure accuracy.

Analyzing Narrative Variations

I'm presently examining variations within the narrations. I've translated the Sufyān-Al-Zuhrī-Usāmah ibn Zayd chain, noting Usāmah's observations of hypocrisy. I'm also including the compiler's commentary. Now, I'm working through Chapter 519 and its implications regarding the chapter heading. I'm focusing on the thematic consistency and will draft my summary based on it.

Exploring Permissible Killing

I've moved on to examining the legal exceptions to the prohibition of killing. I've translated two chains of narration dealing with the lawful circumstances for killing. One focuses on those who engage in disbelief after faith. The other is about retaliation for killing. I am considering the implications of this. I've translated the narrations and chapter headings. I'm focusing on their implications within the larger context.

Revisiting Legal Precedents

I'm now working to ensure the legal rulings are consistent across multiple sources. I've translated two narrations, P794a and P794b. P794a echoes the well-known hadith about executing apostates, and now I have a narration related by Umar regarding an apostate executed by a governor, which is P794b. Umar's response gives insight to the necessity of due process. I'm focusing on the interaction between the two narrations. I've also translated chapter headings related to these narrations.

Examining Legal Exceptions

I'm presently translating narrations dealing with the justifiability of killing. I've translated two related narrations. One involves killing individuals who conspire to murder someone deceitfully, with a ruling by Umar. The other narrates that Umar decreed sorcerers must be killed. I've also translated the relevant chapter headings, ensuring thematic consistency.

Analyzing Related Narrations

I'm now diving into the next set of narrations. I've translated two narrations and chapter headings. One describes Bajālah killing sorceresses. The second narrates that Ḥafṣah, the Prophet's wife, killed a slave girl for practicing witchcraft. I'm focusing on their implications within the larger context.

Investigating Legal Nuances

I've translated narrations on the proper treatment of slain animals, focusing on the concept of 'right' in taking a life. I am now translating P799 which details Ibn ʿAbbās's disagreement with ʿAli's method of dealing with apostates. Specifically, I'm examining the rationale behind Ibn ʿAbbās's objection and translating the corresponding content.

Unveiling Prophetic Curses

I'm now deep into translating narrations about the Prophet's sword and a curse inscribed upon it. I've rendered P800, detailing the writing on the hilt, and P800a, a similar account from a different chain. The core message is clear: Allah curses those who kill non-killers, echoing themes of justice and accountability. Chapter 527 follows: No bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of another. I'm also including P801. I'm focusing on the thematic consistency and the moral implications within these pronouncements.

Analyzing Inter-Personal Justice

I've translated P801a, an important narration about the Prophet's ﷺ interaction with a father and son. I'm focusing on the implied rights and reciprocal obligations. Chapter 528 deals with the principle of reciprocal justice and covenant obligations towards protected people. I have also begun translating P802 about a Muslim killing a Dhimmi and the Prophet's response. I'm analyzing the implications for inter-personal justice.

Translating Justice Narratives

I've translated P802a, which narrates a case involving a Muslim who killed a Dhimmi. ʿAli's handling of the case, from evidence to potential forgiveness and compensation, highlights the sacredness of the covenant. The translated Chapter 529, which emphasizes that a Muslim is not killed for a disbeliever, establishes the critical context. I'm now translating P803, the concluding narration from the Prophet's speech, and am analyzing the implications for justice.

Analyzing Concluding Narrations

I've translated P803a, P804, P804a, and P804b. P803a presents Ali's confirmation of legal principles derived from sources beyond the Quran. P804 reiterates the same principle of a Muslim's sanctity. P804a, a mursal narration, affirms this ruling. P804b provides a historical precedent where 'Uthman levies blood money for a Muslim who killed a non-Muslim, illustrating a deviation from the established principle. I'm focusing on these variations.

Exploring Blood Money Options

I'm presently translating narrations dealing with the alternatives of blood money and retaliation. I've rendered P805a and P805b, which elaborate on the family's choices in cases of homicide. I've also translated P806, and its focus is on Simāk's inquiry to Ibn Abī Dhiʾb about the matter. This section of Chapter 530, detailing these legal provisions, is now complete. I'm focusing on the intricacies of the legal choices available to the family of the victim.

Interpreting Divine Revelation

I've translated P806a, which focuses on the Conquest of Mecca sermon. The emphasis is on Mecca's sanctity and the Prophet's ﷺ authority. I've also completed P807, providing a comparative analysis of the verse on retaliation. I am focusing on the balance established between the Torah, the Gospel, and the Islamic perspective.

Clarifying Quasi-Intentionality

I've translated P808, which reveals strong language against those who celebrate the killing of a believer, emphasizing the principle of Qisas (retaliation) or Diyah (blood money) unless the heirs are satisfied. I've also completed the translation of P809, detailing the specific legal consequences of quasi-intentional killing involving a whip or stick, specifying 100 camels as compensation with stricter age categories. I'm now drafting the corresponding section with those details. I've also now completed P809a, which is a companion's account on the same topic.

Assessing Accidentality in Warfare

I'm now focusing on narratives regarding accidental killings during warfare. I've rendered P810, clarifying that deaths from stones or whips in confused melees are errors requiring blood money, while intentional killings merit retaliation. Also, I've confirmed that P810a mirrors earlier rulings. The chapter heading, C532, specifies accidental war deaths. Finally, P810b narrates Abū Ḥudhayfah ibn al-Yamān's death, killed mistakenly by Muslims, and the Prophet's Diyah payment.

Examining Blood Money

I've clarified the historical discrepancy regarding the victim's name in P810b: it was Al-Yamān, not Al-Yamān (the father). I've now translated the chain and content of P811. Also, C533's chapter on blood money is now complete. I'm focusing on the specifics. Finally, I've translated P812 and P812a.

Revising Valuation Rules

I've translated P812b, confirming consistency in meaning. Chapter 534 establishes the precise valuation of blood money camels. Now, I'm analyzing the valuations. I've translated P813, which details the Prophet's market-based approach to camel valuation, setting a standard of 400 dinars or equivalent silver. Additionally, I've now rendered P813a.

Analyzing Fetuses' Blood Money

I'm presently translating narrations on fetal blood money. I've completed the translation of P814, P814a, and P815, which all focus on the legal rulings regarding miscarriages and their compensation, including the "Ghurrah". My recent focus has been on exploring the justifications for this legal ruling and the circumstances where agnates bear the responsibility. I am also currently working on the inclusion of the ruling regarding the family's choice.

Consolidating Fetal Legalities

I've translated P815b, echoing the earlier narration. Chapter 536 examines slave injuries. I've also translated P816 and P816a, establishing that a slave's blood money is tied to market value. Now, Chapter 537 explores blood money for Dhimmis and Magians. I'm focusing on the ethical and legal implications, specifically the value parity.

Detailing Blood Money Regulations

I've translated P817, revealing ʿUthman's judgment of 4000 for a Mu'ahid's diyah, with Sa'id's reaction indicating the ruling's independance of the specific details of the situation. I've also rendered P817a and P817b, which are related narrations, and am noting the variations. Finally, Chapter 538's focus on blood money for body parts is now translated, along with P818 and its specific blood money rulings for various injuries. I'm carefully analyzing these financial arrangements.

Revising Injury Compensation

I've translated P818a, which is a reiteration of the finger blood money. My current task involves ensuring consistency across injury valuations. I'm carefully comparing the financial compensation assigned to various body parts, cross-referencing against the established market-based values. I am also planning to organize the data into an easy-to-use table.

Reviewing Final Adjustments

I've completed my final review of the text, meticulously checking for any instances of "God" in place of "Allah", ensuring the proper inclusion of "ﷺ", verifying the verse translations in P807, and confirming the accurate translation of P797a's terms, with Rāʿūfah now translated as "under a stone at the bottom of the well" to capture the intended meaning. I've also re-confirmed "struck my chest" as fa-ḍaraba ṣadrī in P806, ensuring consistency with the source text. Finally, I've confirmed that "Kitāb" is appropriately translated as "Book/Letter/Document" depending on the context in P812, and verified the understanding of "Sajʿ" in P815 as "Rhymed prose."

I'm now focusing on the nuances of the translator's role, specifically their expertise in Islamic content. Understanding this specialization is key to ensuring the accuracy and sensitivity of the final translation. I'm considering how this informs the approach to potential ambiguities and cultural references.

Detailing the Approach

I'm presently translating segment P9544b from Tafsīr al-Ṭabarī. My methodology prioritizes accuracy, adhering strictly to the client's guidelines. Specifically, I’m grappling with preserving IDs, handling isnad chains, and applying ALA-LC transliteration. The translation process is methodical, with each segment undergoing four revision passes to ensure compliance. Arabic text is excluded from the final version, with the exception of the ﷺ abbreviation.

Processing the Verse

Now, I'm deep into the Al-Hijr verse's interpretation. I'm carefully analyzing Abraham's dialogue with the angels and the specific phrase "Do you give me glad tidings?" I'm meticulously tracing the narrator chains (isnad) within the Tafsir, deciphering each level of nested structure. Currently, I'm focused on the various chains leading back to Mujāhid's interpretation and ensuring the inclusion of the ﷺ abbreviation.

Deciphering Interpretations

I'm now analyzing the Tafsīr excerpt, specifically focusing on Mujāhid's interpretation of Abraham's reaction to the glad tidings. I'm carefully reviewing the isnad chain, tracing it back to Mujāhid, and trying to understand the nuances of the phrase "Because old age has touched me." Additionally, I'm integrating the provided grammar analysis and considering the parallel with verse 7:105 to enhance accuracy. Finally, I'm examining the meaning of Qāniṭīn.

Exploring Quranic Variations

I am now delving into the differences in readings, specifically between Al-Qāniṭīn and Al-Qaniṭīn. I'm focused on the interpretations linked to this, considering the implications of each variant in the context of the verse. I'm also examining how these variations influence the translation of Abraham's dialogue and how the scholars interpreted the meaning of Dalal, considering grammatical and stylistic differences in similar verses such as 42:28.

Dissecting Linguistic Nuances

I'm currently engaged with the nuances of guttural verbs like "Fa'ala," specifically focusing on the debated vowel markings for "Yaqnaṭu." I'm weighing the implications of fatḥah versus kasrah on the Nūn, as I examine how Tabari's arguments support the fatḥah, connecting it to verse 42:28. I am also investigating variations and their impact on interpreting Abraham's dialogue with the angels, and the relationship between morphological rules and usage.

Clarifying the Narrative

I'm now focused on the story of Lot and the angels, meticulously interpreting segments C4888, P9547a, P9548, and C4889. I'm carefully analyzing the Quranic verses, specifically 15:57-65, to construct a cohesive narrative. The key focus is to accurately translate the dialogue between the angels and Lot, particularly how the divine decree regarding Lot's family is portrayed. I am considering the varying interpretations of yamtarūn to ensure contextual accuracy.

Analyzing the Decree

I'm now interpreting the divine decree related to Lot's people, specifically examining the meaning of Qaḍaynā and Dābir. I'm also comparing Mujāhid, Qatādah and Ibn Zayd's narrations regarding Lot's departure. I'm focusing on how the phrase "the root of these will be cut off" is presented in the narrative. I'm carefully considering the implications of Ibn Mas'ūd's reading, and the context of the People of Sodom's rejoicing.

Revisiting Interpretations

I'm now wrestling with the interpretations of Lot's plea and the subsequent events, specifically segments C4893, C4895, and C4894. I'm focusing on the various translations of 15:68-73. The key challenge involves reconciling the different interpretations of "my daughters" with the understanding of La'amruka and its link to the Prophet Muhammad. I am carefully analyzing the narrations of Ibn 'Abbas, Qatadah, and Mujahid, and their interpretations.

Comparing Interpretations

My focus has shifted to the multiple interpretations of Ya‘mahūn, with Al-Jawzā’ from Ibn ‘Abbās highlighting "playing," Qatādah suggesting "wandering/hesitating," and ‘Alī from Ibn ‘Abbās advocating "persisting." I'm now examining Ibn ‘Abbās's disapproval of using "By my life" ("La'amrī"), linking it to the verse. I'm also grappling with the phrase "when the sun rose" (15:73), analyzing Mushriqīn and Muṣbiḥīn as accusative of state. Additionally, I'm translating Sijjīl (baked clay) and considering the audience of these verses.

Refining Translations

I'm now integrating insights from the provided Hadith, focusing on the translation of firāsah as "insight" or "perspicacity." Analyzing the varying interpretations, particularly Ibn ‘Abbās's "onlookers" and Qatādah's "those who learn a lesson," is essential. Also, the translation of Sabīl Muqīm in 15:76-77, emphasizing the established path, is crucial, and the imagery linked to the sign for believers will require further revision.

Tracing Interpretations

I'm now focusing on a specific path, and it is a clear road that is followed. Currently I am looking at C4903 - P9564, and the meaning of Imām Mubīn. I'm also looking at the interpretation given by Ibn ‘Abbās: On the road... and Mujāhid: A marked road. Further, I am looking at C4904 - P9565a, which covers the companions of Al-Ḥijr. I'm focusing on the geography, Al-Ḥijr and Thammud. I'm also looking at a related Hadith. Finally, I'm working with C4905 - P9566a, focusing on carving houses from mountains and safety, and also at C4906 - P9567.

Evaluating Interpretations

I'm now analyzing the interpretations of 15:85, with focus on Al-Sab‘u al-Mathānī, exploring its meaning and the narrations surrounding it. I'm carefully examining the interpretations by Ibn Mas'ūd, Ibn ‘Umar, Ibn ‘Abbās, and Sa‘īd ibn Jubayr, focusing on their stance on the "Seven Long Surahs". I am comparing them to al-Hasan's interpretations and evaluating whether this is Fatiha, and evaluating how this impacts the translation.

Clarifying the Seven

I'm currently engaged with the Seven Long Surahs, specifically exploring the discrepancies in interpretations. I'm focusing on Tabari's cited narrations about Moses being given two or six, leading to variations in the list. I'm carefully analyzing the meaning of Mathānī as repeated stories/rulings. Furthermore, I've confirmed proper ID and chain handling. I'm ensuring consistent transliteration and proper use of "Allah" and the ﷺ abbreviation.

Analyzing First Text Segment

I am now focusing on translating and aligning the first section, meticulously preserving the original isnād chains, correctly handling religious terminology, and transliterating narrator names according to the ALA-LC rules.

Commencing Initial Translation

I'm now starting the first pass of the full translation, focusing on preserving isnāds and religious terms like ta'wīl, and adhering to ALA-LC for narrators.

I need to translate the provided Arabic text to English while keeping segment IDs like P338. I will use ALA-LC transliteration for narrator names in the chain, but not for the hadith content. I'll also ensure the right phrasing, using "Allah" instead of "God", and ensure all headings and content are translated with no Arabic words left in the text except for ﷺ. Three internal revisions will help.

Deciding on transliteration for narrators' names
I need to transliterate specific names in the narration chain using ALA-LC (e.g., Abd Allāh, Muḥammad, Mālik). However, the instruction specifies to transliterate only the narrator names in the chain, not the textual content. Outside the chain, for scholar names, I should likely stick to ALA-LC transliteration, but I’m a bit unsure about whether to forgo transliteration for some names like Abdul Muhsin al-Abbad.

Deciding on transliteration and formatting rules
The instruction specifies that ALA-LC transliteration should only be used for narrator names within the chain, not outside it. Thus, I'll use diacritics for narrator names in the chain but simplify other terms (e.g., Abu Dawud) without diacritics. For headings, I’ll keep them in proper case and include necessary translations in parentheses. I’ll translate bracketed portions, but I’ll likely keep the brackets for clarity.

Translating and formatting hadith excerpts
I’ll replicate the bracketed hadith excerpt after “the author said: [ ... ]”, translating the content inside the brackets (including the chain with the narrators). I will transliterate narrator names in the chain using ALA-LC, just like in the example provided. This includes utilizing "may Allah have mercy on him" and "may Allah be pleased with him" for the relevant figures.

Using diacritics and handling terminology
For "Banū ʿAbd al-Dār," it's part of a narrator's description, not a narrator name, so I'll avoid diacritics there and use "Banu Abd al-Dar" instead. For terms like "nabidh" and "wuḍūʾ," I'll keep them without diacritics, as the instruction only mentions applying diacritics to narrator names. For technical accuracy, I'll use translations for religious terms like “may Allah be pleased with him,” and terms like “chain of narration” for hadith scientific vocabulary.

Using diacritics and simplifying terms
The instruction is clear: ALA-LC transliteration applies only to names in chains, so I’ll avoid diacritics when not referring to narrators. Instead of using "wuḍūʾ" or similar terms with diacritics, I’ll use standard transliterations like "wudu" and "tayammum." For headings and body text, I'll make sure to avoid Arabic characters and keep explanations literal where necessary, including using parentheses for any alternate terms. "Hannād" without diacritics seems acceptable for the narration chain.

Clarifying translation instructions for Siyar A'lam al-Nubala
I need to translate Arabic sections of Siyar A'lam al-Nubala while preserving the original IDs. For names of narrators in the isnads (like “روى عنه”), I should use ALA-LC transliteration. Titles of books in quotes may need translation into English, and Arabic terms—like الكافي—should be transliterated into Latin letters.

Finalizing transliteration and translation guidelines
For transliterating Arabic terms like "الكافي" or "ديوان," I'll use "al-Kāfī" and "Dīwān", keeping each without Arabic script. Key phrases like "صلى الله عليه وسلم" will stay as ﷺ. I'll follow ALA-LC transliteration for names and terms, ensuring long vowels, and special letters like ʿ, ḥ, ṣ, etc., are accurate.

Translating "تدريب الطرق" and other terms carefully
I need to be cautious with terms like "الخوارزمية" (Khwārazmians) and "الميطور" which might be "al-Mayṭūr" or "al-Maṭūr" — I'll stick to "al-Mayṭūr" for now. For "تدريب الطرق," it probably means "training the roads," but could also refer to "setting up roadblocks" or "placing guards," depending on context.

Interpreting and translating Khwārazmian context
He ordered, during the Khwārazmian period, to prepare roads in al-Ṣāliḥiyya, gather supplies and men, and to take precautions. "Tadrīb al-ṭuruq" will be translated as "to prepare the routes." As they approached from al-Mayṭūr, the khāns dismounted, greeted, and kissed the hand of the shaykh. Later, Ḥasan was killed. The shaykh died in Rabīʿ al-Ākhir 643 AH.

Translating for clarity and precision
We'll translate "in Rabīʿ al-Ākhir, in the year 643 AH" for clarity, avoiding "ست مائة". Names like Ibn al-Nakhkhāl will be transliterated with titles like "the musnid." "Mufīd Baghdād" will be "Mufīd of Baghdad." For other terms like "khalqan", I'll translate to "a multitude" and "the skilled" for "muʾaddal". We'll keep "574" for the birth year.

Translating names and titles with precision
In this context, I'll keep names and titles like "al-Salkhad" and "Ṣarkhad" for clarity, though Ṣarkhad may refer to Salkhad. For Ibn Ḥamūd, I’ll translate him as "the eloquent, accomplished imam." When mentioning "bawārid," I'll translate it as "oddities" or "rare items" to better reflect its meaning. Both names and details will preserve their scholarly form.

Translating death and age references in context
I’ll keep "bawārid" as transliterated, explaining it as "choice selections." For Ibn Abī Jaʿfar, I'll clarify that he died in Jumādā I, 643. Regarding his hearing personal narrations, I'll phrase it as "at the end of his fifth year." My best guess is that his death in "year three" refers to 643.

Translating and formatting names and titles
It seems "Jumādā" is unspecified regarding which month, so I’ll just leave it as "Jumādā." The burial at Qāsiyūn will stay in plain text. For Ibn al-Mundhirī, I’ll ensure to transliterate only narrators’ names as instructed. I’ll keep book titles and place names in their original form or use ALA-LC.

Handling transliterations for names and places
The instruction is clear: ALA-LC transliteration should only apply to narrator names in the chain. For non-narrator names, I’ll likely stick with the common English forms (e.g., Isfahan, Baghdad, Damascus) or minimal diacritics. For books, I might leave them untranslated. Personal names will follow ALA-LC.

Deciding on how to handle book titles
For book titles in Arabic, like "الكافي," the context says it's commonly known as "al-Kāfī" in Hanbali fiqh. Translating it as "The Sufficient" is possible, but to stay consistent with technical texts, I’ll likely keep it as "al-Kāfī" using ALA-LC without full diacritics, since it’s not a narrator's name.

Transliterating book titles and place names
For book titles like "al-Kāfī," I'll likely use transliteration, even though it's not a narrator's name. While other terms may be translated, places like "al-ʿAqaba" will be more literal in context. To make things clear and consistent, I'll apply ALA-LC transliteration mainly on narrator names, with simplified overlay for place names.

Translating names, events, and terms accurately
I'll carefully translate names and references like "Ibn al-Nakhkhāl" and "Ibn al-ʿImād" while adhering to ALA-LC for narrators' names. For place names, I'll simplify and avoid using diacritics. I'll also make sure to preserve technical terms like "takhrīj" and "pubs and compilations" while respecting the user's guidelines.

Translating and handling technical terms carefully
I need to make sure translations are consistent with ALA-LC standards, especially for names like "al-Fakhr Ghulām Ibn al-Munī" or "al-Izz Ibn al-ʿImād," while ensuring technical terms and dates are accurate. I'll transliterate months to "Jumada I" and "Jumada II" without diacritics, as they aren't part of the narrators' names, keeping the focus on clarity.

Refining translations and maintaining consistency
I’m reviewing translations for accuracy. I'll use ALA-LC for transliterations, including months like "Rabīʿ al-Ākhir," and retain consistency with established terms. I’ll clarify some phrases, like "He was religious, altruistic" for "Wakāna dīnan muʾaththiran" and adjust some context-sensitive terms, like "He compiled for himself."

I need to follow the instruction by applying ALA-LC transliteration only to narrators in the chain (isnad). For other names, I can provide simple transliteration without diacritics or use Anglicized forms. I'll avoid applying ALA-LC to non-chain names to stay compliant with the guidelines.

Translating names and handling special formatting
For transliterating narrator names in the isnad, I’ll stick to ALA-LC, but for other names in biography sections, I'll use simplified transliteration without diacritics (e.g., Ali, Abd al-Samad). I won’t use special characters like ʿ or ḥ. I'll also ensure to keep everything in plain text without markdown and properly format the IDs. Adjusting headings, poetry verses, and Qur’anic quotes as needed too.

Handling Arabic characters and symbols in translation
For P9262, it's clear I need to avoid Arabic characters except for ﷺ. The symbol ﵏ does seem to correspond to 'rahimahu Allah’, but it’s an Arabic script character in Unicode. Since the instruction specifies no Arabic characters, I’ll need to consider if this symbol should be omitted. I’ll adjust accordingly.

Handling mercy phrase and focusing on transliteration
For the “may Allah have mercy on him” phrase at the end, I'll translate it as "may Allah have mercy on them" for plural consistency. The symbol "﵏" likely stands for "rahimahu Allah." In P9263, I will apply ALA-LC transliteration to the names of narrators in the chain with proper diacritics: Yaḥyá, ʿAbd al-Qādir, and others as listed.

Translating content and naming conventions
In terms of Abu Bakr, since it's part of the matn (content) and not the isnad (chain), I won't apply ALA-LC transliteration there. I'll simply use "Abu Bakr" in plain form. For the transliterations, I'll follow the ALA-LC style for narrators' names, using their correct diacritics throughout the text.

Translating and handling names
For the narrators, I’ll apply ALA-LC transliteration, including diacritics as needed, for names like Aḥmad b. ʿAbd al-Dāʾim and Ibn ʿUyaynah. For non-chain names in the biography, like Ibn al-Ball, I'll use simplified transliteration. I will also adjust any unclear phrases and handle the mention of Ma'ruf al-Karkhi and the son’s dispute carefully.

Translating names and titles accurately
For book titles like "al-Just", I'll keep the transliteration as is instead of applying ALA-LC since it's a title. The narrator names can still follow ALA-LC. Regarding the phrase “his knowledge is not from the provisions for the Hereafter,” I'll go with a literal translation instead of assuming disparagement. I’ll mention the personal details about scholars appropriately while noting their significance.

Clarifying the succession details
The translation is progressing steadily, but I need to clarify the details around Nur al-Din Arslan Shah's succession. He was ten years old when he took over, but it seems his younger brother, only three, was installed after his death in the same year. As for the rest, I will continue translating accordingly.

Summarizing family, scholarship, and legacy
He married al-Qutb’s daughter and had significant sons like Imad al-Din Umar, Fakhr al-Din Yusuf, Kamal al-Din Ahmad, and Mu'in al-Din Hasan. He taught at al-Shafi’i and possibly Mashhad al-Husayn, communicating with the caliph, but passed away in 617 after an illness in Mosul. His demeanor was notable for its calm, forbearance, and merit.

Summarizing scholarly achievements and judicial role
He narrated from significant works like "Dala'il al-Nubuwwah" and "Sahih Muslim," excelling in issuing fatwas. He studied with scholars such as Abu al-Hasan al-Muradi in Aleppo, held judiciary roles in Damascus, and became chief judge in 612. He was highly respected for his knowledge and demeanor, with notable figures like Sheikh Izz al-Din praising his fiqh expertise.

Summarizing life and minimal judgment system
He spent 2 years and 7 months as a judge before passing away at 95, with a significant funeral. He lived a life of asceticism, and was known for adhering to Shari'ah law, refusing to be swayed by worldly recommendations. His strict, just nature earned him much respect.

I need to translate Arabic to English with plain text while preserving IDs, and apply ALA-LC transliteration only on the names of narrators in isnads. For biographies outside of chains, I should likely keep the names of narrators in Latin without diacritics, and not apply transliteration to the rest of the content.

Translating names while following the instructions
It seems the instruction limits the ALA-LC transliteration to narrators' names in the chain and not other content. For non-narrator names, translating them into English without diacritics might work, or I could use ALA-LC for all personal names, ensuring only the names are transliterated and not common nouns.

Translating terms and names carefully
I’ll transliterate all names with ALA-LC diacritics as required, making sure to avoid Arabic letters except for ﷺ. I’ll use "Allah" instead of "God." For terms like "إمام الأئمة," I'll translate as "Imam of the Imams," and for "فقه العُبَيْدية," I’ll use "the jurisprudence of the ʿUbaydiyyah." Translating technical terms like this seems fine, while regular content stays unchanged.

Translating hadith with caution
For the hadith, I’ll translate "الذي يجر ثوبه من الخيلاء" as "He who drags his garment out of arrogance—Allah will not look at him on the Day of Resurrection." For "هذا حديث غريب من هذا الوجه," I’ll translate as "This is an unusual hadith by this route,” using "gharīb" for the technical term, without Arabic characters or formatting. I’ll follow the instruction on diacritics.

Translating hadith and biographical details
I'll translate technical terms by meaning, like "gharīb" as "an uncommon hadith." For some terms, I'll use their appropriate English equivalents, like "al-Nasa'i transmitted it in the Book of the Hadiths of Malik." Biographical details will keep the birth and death years in numbers, such as 293 AH, and I'll ensure accuracy for other numbers and titles.

Translating hadith details and biographical names
For "but his audition from al-Baghawī..." I'll use "his hearing from al-Baghawī and a group is lacking," meaning it's unconfirmed. When talking about "he was unique in his time," “singled out” works. I'll carefully transliterate names, like Muḥammad ibn Muḥammad ibn Aḥmad ibn Isḥāq al-Naysābūrī, in ALA-LC format.

Translating and transliterating names and terms carefully
The narrator "Ṣaddaqah ibn Manṣūr al-Kindī al-Ḥarrānī" seems correct, so I’ll keep the transliteration. For "محمد بن مروان بن عبد الملك" I’ll translate to "Muḥammad ibn Khuraym al-ʿUqaylī." I’ll explain his roles in positions of judgeship and handle "his eyesight was taken" as he became blind in 376. I'll also avoid Arabic characters except for ﷺ.

Translating nuances and context in narration
The phrase "khulqān" refers to two worn garments, so I’ll translate it as: "and I had on two worn garments." Later, when he says "I've got it memorized" to his vizier, I’ll keep that straightforward. For the story about "Tārīkh al-Bukhārī," I'll clarify that they added and removed content, shaping a new work, not just repeating it.

Translating and ensuring proper diacriticals on names
I'll make sure to keep Abū Ghassān's Shi'ism note intact without elaborating too much. Next, I’ll transliterate names such as ʿUbayd Allāh ibn Mūsā, Aḥmad ibn Hibat Allāh, and others with care, using ALA-LC diacritics for every chain but avoiding these diacritics on regular words. I'll apply this throughout.

Transliteration guidelines for names
For ALA-LC transliteration, I’ll use the Latin characters for Arabic sounds, like ḥ, ṣ, ṭ, and ʿ, while keeping long vowels (ā, ī, ū). For the definite article "al-", I’ll keep it with a hyphen, even with sun letters. For names, I'll use "Abū" when appropriate and transliterate "ʿAbd Allāh" with macrons on "Allāh."

Headings and transliteration
For headings, I’ll translate as needed. Names like "Isḥāq ibn Saʿd" will be transliterated, while terms like "Qāḍī of Egypt" will be translated as "Judge of Egypt." For place names like Baghdad, I’ll use standard English, but for consistency, I’ll apply transliteration with diacritics where necessary. I'll also handle specific terms like "majlis al-imlāʾ" as a dictation session.

Translating and applying formats for reports and names
For translating names and titles, I’ll keep standard transliteration for recognized figures and locations. For terms like “ayyam al-nas,” I’ll keep “historical battle-days of people” or simply “the days of people.” I’ll ensure proper use of ellipses, maintain punctuation consistency, and clarify narrators with faithful transliterations. Also, titles like "Hadith scholar of Khurasan" will be translated accurately.

Translating historical names and titles with precision
I’m focusing on transliterating these complex historical names accurately, like "Aḥmad ibn Muḥammad al-Māsarjisī" and "ʿAbd Allāh ibn Zaydān al-Bajlī". I'll also ensure the meanings in Arabic, like "muqaddam fī," get translated clearly too. Important terms like “tazkiyah” will be clarified as “attesting to persons' reliability” in a court context.

Translating historical texts and hadith references
I’m translating various historical statements and hadith references here. For example, "he authored works on the two books of the two shaykhs" refers to commentaries, and “a takhrīj on the book of al-Muzanī” means he produced a study of the book’s authenticity. I’ll also clarify terms like “ahl baladih” as referencing local imams or community leaders.

Translating hadith and names during historical narration
I’m translating and working through narration chains and hadith references in a detailed historical context, where specific Arabic terms like "marfūʿ" (raised to the Prophet) need careful handling. I’ll avoid excessive transliteration, address key book titles like "The Kunyas" and "al-Jarḥ wa-l-Taʿdīl" as appropriate.

Translating technical hadith terms and names
For Islamic technical terms, I should focus on translating them rather than transliterating, in line with the request. For titles like "ḥāfiẓ" or "musnid" I’ll translate them as "hadith master" and "hadith transmitter," while making sure to comply with diacritics for the narrators' names, each carefully checked without shortcuts.

Translating Arabic with ALA-LC guidance
I need to translate the provided Arabic text without markdown, while preserving the IDs and segment order. I'll transliterate the names of narrators in chains using ALA-LC, but leave the rest of the textual content in regular translation. For other contexts, names can be translated into English, but Islamic content typically keeps names in transliteration.

Translating and transliterating names following guidelines
The instruction says to use ALA-LC for narrator names in chains. Since we can’t use Arabic characters, I’ll transliterate all names in ALA-LC for consistency. For hadith text, we won't transliterate names like the Prophet because they’re part of the content, not the narrator chain. I'll stick with ALA-LC for all names, especially in chains.

Translating Islamic terms with clarity
For technical terms like "imam," "ḥāfiẓ," and "muhaddith," I'll translate them literally while keeping transliterations in parenthesis for clarification: "the great imam, the eminent ḥāfiẓ, the proof (ḥujja), the critic". For terms like "mursal," I'll include explanations in plain text. Since the instruction specifically mentions narrator names, tech terms can be handled with transliteration and translation.

Translating and preserving hadith content
For this hadith, I'll translate terms carefully while staying true to the text. For example, I'll use "Allah" instead of "God." The phrase "عزين" refers to groups of people, which I'll clarify with proper context. I'll also maintain the specific segments, including references like P5379, P5380, and others, as they are, and keep titles like "Mūsā ibn Hārūn."

Translating abbreviations and symbols
The Arabic letters "خ، د، ت، س" represent abbreviations for canonical collections (Bukhari, Abu Dawud, Tirmidhi, Nasa'i). I'll translate them to their Latin equivalents: "B, D, T, N." For "ع," I'll keep it as "ʿ" since it's a Latin character with the diacritic, which fits the instruction of no Arabic characters but still respects the format.

Translating abbreviations and symbols
The letters "م," "خ، د، ت، س" need to be transliterated properly. For clarity, I'll use "M" for Muslim, and for "خ، د، ت، س," I'll turn those into "B, AbD, T, N" as the standard English equivalents. As for "ع," I'll keep it as "ʿ" because it's understood in the context. This matches their original meanings while staying in line with translation.

Translating Arabic textual content with ALA-LC rules
Translating abbreviations and symbols for hadith sources
The symbol "ع" indicates all six books agreeing, as quoted from Dhahabi's Kashif. I’ll translate heading abbreviations like "P5382" as "M", "P5383" as "B, AbD, T, N". For "ʿ", I'll render it as "B, M, AbD, T, N, IJ" to represent the six books. The heading will read 'Abū Mūsā: (the Six)'. I'll keep everything in quotes if needed.

Finalizing transliteration and formatting for hadith texts
Following the instructions, I’ll keep IDs at the beginning and avoid quoting symbols. I’ll use appropriate transliteration for names according to ALA-LC standards, with macrons and dots for accuracy. For names like "Mūsā ibn Hārūn" and "Duʿlaj al-Sijzī," I'll follow the guidelines, using "al-" consistently with a hyphen. This should ensure readability and clarity.

Transliterating narrators and hadith chain
For the narrators, I’ll follow the standard transliteration: "al-Sharīf Abū al-Ḥasan ʿAlī ibn Aḥmad al-ʿAlawī" and the others, ensuring clarity in their names. In the matn, “the Prophet ﷺ entered upon us while we were sitting in circles in the mosque” works fine. For the second isnad, "And with it: to al-Baghawī" follows simply here.

Transliterating isnad and chain of narration
For the isnad chain, I’ll transliterate each name properly: "Yaḥyā ibn Abī Manṣūr, ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ibn Muḥammad, and ʿAlī ibn Aḥmad al-Ḥanbalī—the Hanbalis—and a group in writing said: ...". I’ve clarified that “Hanbalis” refers to all three. The rest of the names in the chain are: ʿUmar ibn Muḥammad, Hibat Allāh ibn Muḥammad, and so on. I'll continue with the translation of the matn later.

Translating biographies and hadiths
The text contains several biographies and hadiths that need translation. For instance, "Abū Bakr Muḥammad ibn Abī ʿAttāb al-Ḥasan ibn Ṭarīf al-Baghdādī" is a name that I’ll transliterate. I’ll also handle the chain for “Ziyād ibn Ayyūb" and translate references like "O Allah, bless my ummah in its early mornings." Plus, translating phrases like "We are a people with honor: the Prophet ﷺ prayed toward us" in context.

Finalizing translation choices
It looks like the translation needs to stay very literal while keeping punctuation and formatting correct. I’ll use consistent phrasing for hadith-related verbs, like "narrated to us" and "informed us" where appropriate, and will avoid any Arabic digits, sticking to Latin letters with diacritics. I'll revise three times internally to ensure coherence without straying from the original.

Ensuring transliteration and clarity
For consistency, we're opting for "in writing" and translating place names like Baghdad, Egypt, and Alexandria. When transliterating months like Shaʿbān and Dhū al-Qaʿdah, I’ll keep the Latin characters with diacritics. For dates, I’ll clarify "214 AH" and "294 AH." I’ll also confirm accuracy for names and ensure the ALA-LC transliteration standard.

Finalizing transliteration and clarification
For names like "Muḥāḍir ibn al-Muwarriʿ," we’ll go with the known transliteration. For others, like "al-Musayyib," "Jābir ibn Samurah," "Kāmil ibn Ṭalḥah," we’ll keep consistent with the transliterations used in earlier texts. I'll ensure the terms like "kalām" are translated appropriately, and clarify specific years like 240 AH.

Finalizing transliterations and details
For the transliteration of "الطوسي" to "al-Ṭūsī" and the nickname "دلويه" as "Dalawayh," I'll keep these consistent. I'll also ensure phrases like "رحل، وجمع، وألف" are properly translated, and notes on teachers and hadith narrations are kept. For years like "500 AH," I'll verify those to maintain accuracy.

Clarifying narrations and descriptions
The phrase "ينزل إلى" points to a progression down to later generations in the isnād, clarifying that the narrator came after figures like ʿAffān and Abū al-Walīd, connecting through their student, Abū Jaʿfar Aḥmad ibn Saʿīd al-Dārimī. I'll make sure the translation reflects this chronological descent. Additionally, I'll confirm assessments from various scholars on ḥadīth reliability.

Finalizing translation and adjustments for consistency
I’m finalizing the translation while keeping key technical terms like "ḥasan" and "gharīb" in transliteration since they carry specific meanings in hadith sciences. I also need to ensure formatting consistency by replacing Arabic commas with English ones, adjusting for terms and punctuation. I'll be mindful of including explanations alongside these terms when necessary.

I need to follow the ALA-LC transliteration scheme for narrators’ names, using "ʿ" for 'ayn and "ī" for certain vowels. The issue is deciding whether to use "Ibn" or "b." in "Ibn" names. I have to make sure this fits the format, particularly when narrators appear in partial chains or exploded isnads.

Transliteration decisions and formatting
I need to decide whether to use "b." or "ibn" for narrators' names. ALA-LC uses "ibn" but it's common in hadith translation to use "b." for clarity, and I want to stay consistent throughout. Additionally, I’ll translate terms like "حدثنا" as "narrated to us", and ensure no Arabic characters except ﷺ.

Deciding on translation choices for technical terms
It's tricky since "maghāzī" refers to specific Prophetic biography battles, and while I can't use Arabic, I could go with something like "military expeditions". I should avoid transliterations for textual content, so I’ll stick to translating meaning directly. For "حسن الحديث", I'll say “his ḥadīth are fair” instead.

Deciding on the use of "ḥadīth"
"ḥadīth" may be a technical term in English, but it comes from Arabic. The instructions say to use ALA-LC transliteration for narrator names, not textual content. But "ḥadīth" isn't a narrator name, so I should probably go with "hadith" without diacritics to follow the rule.

Translatory decisions and consistency
For technical terms like "hadith" and "isnad," I’ll use anglicized forms without diacritics. For terms like "thiqah," I’ll translate them as "trustworthy" to maintain clarity. I’ll be careful with the chain statements, keeping their literal context, and translating "ḥāfiẓ" as "the hafiz." I'll ensure IDs remain consistent and segments separated clearly.

Translating and handling narrations and expressions
I need to translate “Muḥammad b. al-Dhahabī said” directly and handle phrases like “dajjāl” carefully. Instead of transliterating, I’ll go with “an impostor among impostors” rather than the more literal “a dajjāl among the dajjāls.” For words like “bayṭār,” I’ll explain that it means “veterinarian.” I'll keep names properly transliterated for clarity.

Handling narration continuity and Ibn Isḥāq's narration status
Regarding al-Khatib's comment about an unknown narrator, Dhahabi rejects it. For the translation of Ibn Isḥāq's narrations, I’ll note that multiple scholars refrained due to his Shiʿi leanings, Qadarite attribution, and use of tadlis, though his truthfulness is not contested. I'll also clarify references to narrators accurately.

Clarifying criticism of Ibn Isḥāq and Mālik’s words
Kaysān narrated a lot from Ibn Isḥāq. Al-Bukhari discusses whether Mālik's supposed criticism of Ibn Isḥāq is valid. Mālik criticized some Quraysh narrators, but still used their narrations in the Muwaṭṭaʾ. Dhahabi mentions that criticism doesn't necessarily damage a scholar’s trustworthiness, especially when disproved.

Summarizing Ibn Isḥāq’s hadith and related statements
Ibn Isḥāq's hadith for legal rulings is considered less sound over time, shifting from ṣaḥīḥ to ḥasan, with unique narrations being rejected. Yūnus b. Bukayr praised Ibn Isḥāq’s knowledge, while ʿAlī b. ʿAbd Allāh found no major issues. The discussion also touches on the practice of written communication in historical times.

Summarizing Ibn Isḥāq’s hadith and related discussions
Ibn Isḥāq’s narrations are well-regarded by many experts, including figures like Sufyān, Shuʿbah, and others. He was praised for his truthfulness and the authenticity of his hadith. However, he faced accusations of Qadarism, impacting his reputation. Some suggest he was unjustly harmed due to his association with certain views.

Reviewing Ibn Ishaq's narration practices and critiques
Ibn Ishaq's hadiths are highly regarded by many, though he faced criticism from some due to practices like tadlīs. Some scholars accepted his narrations, while others were cautious about his transmitters, especially those who were less reliable. He was repeatedly praised for his output, although certain hadiths were disputed due to their sources or phrasing inconsistencies.

Translating Arabic text from Sharh Sunan Abu Dawud
I need to translate the Arabic text from Sharh Sunan Abu Dawud by Abdul Muhsin al-Abbad. I'll preserve the IDs at the beginning of the segments and ensure any textual elements like Allah are translated appropriately. Names in the isnad will be transliterated following ALA-LC. No Arabic characters, except ﷺ, will be included.

Finalizing translation approach
The user requested no markdown or Arabic characters, so I will ensure the text is in plain, translated form with no curly braces for Arabic, except for ﷺ. I'll include citations in plain text, possibly at the end or beginning, and I’ll stick to transliterating names of narrators only. All religious references need proper translations.

Handling transliteration and names
The user’s instruction is clear: I’ll need to transliterate the names of narrators in the isnad (chain) using ALA-LC. Any other figures, like Aisha or al-Albani, outside the chain, can use conventional English forms. Bracketed phrases for the chain will stay as is, and no transliteration for the textual content itself.

Transliterating names in isnad and commentary
For the chain segments, I’ll follow instructions and use ALA-LC for transliterating the narrator names. Outside of the isnad, though, I can stick to common, familiar English forms without diacritics. I'll ensure transliteration for narrators when they’re mentioned in the context of the isnad or biographical details.

Transliterating and translating terms
For consistency, I’ll transliterate narrator names with diacritics, as that's the user's only instruction. I’ll avoid transliterating other Arabic words and use English translations for technical terms like "ṣadūq" ("truthful"). For terms like "Allah," I’ll use the appropriate translation, keeping technical jargon in line with the literal request.

Translating technical terms with accuracy
For terms like "مقبول" (maqbūl), I’ll use "acceptable" with an explanation in parentheses instead of transliterating. For jarh terms, consistency is key, so I’ll maintain clear translations. I’ll also ensure hadiths like "لا رضاع إلا ما شد العظم" are translated accurately, preserving the nuance of the original.

Translating and citing without Arabic script
I’ll preserve the format with item IDs like P6727, followed by the translated heading, keeping the dash. Surah names should be avoided in transliteration since they’re not narrators. Instead, I’ll use "Qur'an" and cite verses like "Qur'an 33:5" without Arabic script. Citation will be in plain text at the end.

Handling translations and file review
For the hadith translation, I’ll make sure to translate “رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم” as "the Messenger of Allah ﷺ" and keep ﷺ for all instances. Also, I will translate “God” as Allah, unless referring to ilāh. I’ll check the file content thoroughly, ensuring no part is missing, and load it properly for review.

Ensuring no Arabic content and full file review
I’ll make sure there’s no Arabic in the output. Each segment starts with P#### and a hyphen, so I’ll focus on translating these segments. I need to carefully review the full file to check if there are any additional IDs or content beyond the snippet to make sure everything gets translated correctly.

Translating segments and preserving format
There are 54 segments to translate, which is lengthy but manageable. I'll translate headings like "تراجم رجال إسناد حديث ابن مسعود..." into English. I’ll keep the bracketed chain markers, like "[حدثنا ...]," in the original square brackets, but translate the Arabic content inside, using proper ALA-LC transliteration for narrators (e.g., ʿAbd al-Salām ibn Muṭahhar).

Translating complex epithets
The epithets must be carefully transliterated using ALA-LC: "الهلالي" becomes al-Hilālī, "الأشعري" becomes al-Ashʿarī, and "عبد الله بن مسعود" is ʿAbd Allāh ibn Masʿūd. For more complex names like Ibn Shihab, it translates to Muḥammad ibn Muslim ibn ʿUbayd Allāh ibn Shihāb al-Zuhrī. I’ll ensure accuracy with diacritics.

Translating specific names and epithets
The names and epithets are being carefully transliterated: "محمد بن سليمان الأنباري" becomes Muḥammad ibn Sulaymān al-Anbārī, "وكيع بن الجراح الرؤاسي" becomes Wakīʿ ibn al-Jarrāḥ al-Ruʾāsī, and so on. For titles like al-Qurashiyyah and al-ʿĀmiriyyah, I’ll translate them directly as “al-Qurashiyyah, then al-ʿĀmiriyyah” without Arabic.

Deciding on transliteration for names in hadith
It seems these names like Sahlah aren't part of the isnad (chain), but are part of the hadith text or matn. While the user only wanted the narrators' names transliterated using ALA-LC in the chain, translating the rest of the names in the story is tricky. I shouldn't transliterate the matn itself, but rendering the names into English is necessary to maintain clarity.

Determining transliteration conventions for matn and chain
I’m trying to interpret the instruction about ALA-LC transliteration. Narrator names in the isnad (chain) need to have diacritics and follow ALA-LC. For names in the matn (text), I’ll use common transliterations like Aisha, Abu Hudhayfa, etc., without diacritics. This keeps things straightforward while maintaining accuracy.

Transliteration for chain and matn names
The user instructed to apply ALA-LC transliteration only to narrator names in the isnad (chain). For other names in the narrative (matn), I’ll use standard transliterations without diacritics, like "Abu Hudhayfa". This seems like a reasonable approach, balancing the ALA-LC requirement while maintaining a readable form for other names.

Translating hadith terms and concepts
The user wants ALA-LC transliteration for chain names only, so matn names will use natural English forms without diacritics (e.g., Abu Hudhayfa). For chain markers and Arabic terms, such as "قال المصنف رحمه الله تعالى", we’ll ensure accurate translations, like "The author, may Allah have mercy on him, said". For fiqh terms, we’ll retain precise translations, such as "suckling" for "رضاع".

Aligning with markers and segmentation
We need to ensure that the translation maintains the same segmentation as the original, keeping segments aligned with markers like IDs. We'll use similar segment breaks with blank lines between each part. At the end, we’ll include the citation token discreetly, following system requirements, but the focus will remain on the translation.

Starting with the first few parts
I’ll begin by iterating through the first few parts of the task. I want to ensure everything is clear before moving forward. Taking it step by step will help me stay organized and make sure the translation aligns with the original structure. Let’s keep this focused on clarity.

Carefully translating hadith terminology
I need to ensure correct translation while maintaining hadith commentary. For terms like "marfūʿ", I’ll want to either use the term itself or provide a description, like “attributed to the Prophet ﷺ”. It seems acceptable to keep terms like "athar" and "isnād" as they are used in English academic contexts, but I’ll be cautious so it remains clear.

Clarifying approach to transliterating technical terms
The user hasn't prohibited translating technical terms but specified that only the names of narrators in the chain should follow ALA-LC transliteration. For terms like isnad, athar, marfūʿ, and jarh, I’ll translate them into English (e.g., chain of narration, report, attributed to the Prophet ﷺ) rather than using transliteration, ensuring clarity.

Translating technical terms and ensuring clarity
For terms like "thulāthī," I'll translate as "having a three-narrator chain," and "rukhṣah" as "concession." For others like "maḥārim," I'll translate as "unmarriageable kin," and "riḍāʿah" as "suckling." ALA-LC transliteration will be used only for names with diacritics. I'll manually craft the translation in segments and carefully revise before finalizing.

فالأثر هنا فيه اختصار مخل؛ لأنه يوهم أن أبا موسى الأشعري هو الذي في الإسناد، مع أن أبا موسى الذي في الإسناد متأخر؛ فيكون الإسناد على هذا ثلاثياً؛ لأنه هو الثالث في الإسناد.

Checking for truncation in string output
The ellipses may have been inserted by the file itself rather than by the notebook. Python typically uses "..." to indicate a truncated display in the terminal, but if the ellipses are in the string itself, I’ll verify by checking the exact spot where it's being truncated. I'll use slicing to inspect that part directly.

Finding ellipsis in string segment
seg0=parts[0]
# find ellipsis in seg0
idx=seg0.find("...")
idx

-1
Investigating truncation in Jupyter print output
It looks like the ellipses were inserted by Jupyter, likely due to the output exceeding display limits, rather than any truncation in the actual content. The string "بعض ال...العظم" could indicate partial output. I’ll adjust the print settings to show the full content, especially around references to al-Albani, using repr to extract specific lines.

Investigating output truncation in Jupyter notebook
# show last 600 chars of seg0
print(seg0[-800:])

فالأثر هنا فيه اختصار مخل؛ لأنه يوهم أن أبا موسى الأشعري هو الذي في الإسناد، مع أن أبا موسى الذي في الإسناد متأخر؛ فيكون الإسناد على هذا ثلاثياً؛ لأنه هو الثالث في الإسناد.

Investigating ellipses in the text file
The ellipses inside the string, like "بعض ال...العظم" and "...متأخر", suggest they were inserted due to truncation, possibly by the file search. However, reading directly from the file gives the same output. I should search the text file directly to verify if ellipses are part of the content itself.

Searching for ellipses in text
"..." in text, text.count("...")

(False, 0)
Checking for Unicode ellipsis
It’s odd that the string shows "..." but the text count reads as 0. Maybe it's not regular periods but the Unicode ellipsis character "…". To verify, I’ll check the character encoding by inspecting the position around those ellipses and using ord() to locate the character and confirm if it’s the Unicode ellipsis.

Checking for Unicode ellipsis character
ellipsis_char="…"
text.count(ellipsis_char), seg0.count(ellipsis_char)

(0, 0)
Investigating truncation and ellipses
I'm not sure where the "..." are coming from. It’s possible that Jupyter truncates output and inserts them, even though the actual print function doesn't do that. This could also be due to stdout capturing. To check, I can write to a file or display the output length. I’ll search through the text for “الألباني” to check the relevant segment.

Finding occurrence of "الألباني" in text
pos=text.find("الألباني")

Inspecting output truncation and substring extraction

فالأثر هنا فيه اختصار مخل؛ لأنه يوهم أن أبا موسى الأشعري هو الذي في الإسناد، مع أن أبا موسى الذي في الإسناد متأخر؛ فيكون الإسناد على هذا ثلاثياً؛
Investigating ellipses in the file
The ellipses "..." are present in the original text, but their count is 0. This suggests that they're not just three periods. They might be a Unicode character like "…" instead. I'll check the character codes by searching for "بعض ال" and displaying the next few characters with their repr to confirm this.

Investigating Unicode characters in text substring search
start=text.find("بعض ال")
start, text[start:start+20], repr(text[start:start+40])

(692, 'بعض الطرق- أن رجلاً ', "'بعض الطرق- أن رجلاً كان عنده طفل لم يرضع'")
Checking the substring with expanded slice
When I sliced around index 692, no ellipses appeared, which suggests the ellipses were inserted by print, not the raw file. But we did see "بعض ال...العظم", which should actually correspond to "بعض الطرق- أن رجلاً ...". I’ll expand the slice from 650 to 850 to inspect the full context.

Evaluating substring extraction with extended slice
print(repr(text[620:840]))

'موسى الأشعري.\nوهذا والحديث فيه اختصار، وأصله -كما ذكر الشيخ الألباني في بعض الطرق- أن رجلاً كان عنده طفل لم يرضع، فمص أبوه من ثدي الأم ليرضعه فوجد طعمه في حلقه، فجاء إلى أبي موسى الأشعري فقال: حرمت عليك، ثم ذهب إلى ابن م'
Investigating the ellipsis characters in file
It looks like the file contains "..." but possibly not the ASCII period characters. Python’s repr isn’t truncating—it's just showing the ellipses as they appear. But the text.count("...") returned 0, which doesn’t make sense. Maybe those three dots are actually an Arabic ellipsis "۔۔۔" or something similar. I’ll search for the first occurrence of the period character near that sequence to investigate further.

Investigating character encoding and truncation behavior
# find any '.' ascii in text
dot_positions=[m.start() for m in re.finditer(r'\.', text)]
dot_positions[:10], len(dot_positions)

([113, 165, 189, 239, 254, 295, 306, 419, 435, 528], 63)
Inspecting the character sequence
There are 63 dots, yet the count for "..." is still 0, probably because a newline or other characters might be interrupting the sequence. To investigate, I’ll look at the position where repr shows "ال...قه" and search around positions 650-750 for the "." characters to understand what’s happening.

Finding dot characters in specific text range
for m in re.finditer(r'\.', text[600:760]):
    print(m.start(), text[600+m.start()-5:600+m.start()+5])

32 أشعري.
وهذ
Understanding the truncation and retrieving full text
The dots in "ال...قه" come from truncation, not the file itself. In Python, the repr() function doesn't truncate, but the tool may truncate long outputs and insert "..." for display. To translate, I need to extract the full text directly from the file, potentially by using Python or writing smaller slices to a file for inspection.

Breaking down the text for translation
To handle the 11k characters, I’ll analyze the text in smaller segments. By using Python, I can print lines individually, which reduces the chances of truncation. I don't need the original text to be repeated, just the content, so I’ll print each line with its index for clarity.

Handling truncated lines
It seems lines 13 and 14 were truncated in the output. I'll retrieve those lines from the segment, print their lengths using repr, and then slice them to view the full content. This will ensure that nothing is missed when analyzing the text for translation.

To avoid tool truncation, I'll split the long lines into smaller chunks—around 80 characters each—so everything can be printed fully without cutting off. This will help ensure I capture all the content without missing any details, especially if the tool truncates lines longer than 200 characters.

Translating long hadith and brackets
The hadith text inside the bracket starting with "باب من حرم به" is quite large, so it needs translation in parts. I'll focus on translating the entire portion inside the bracket first.

Handling long line truncation
Line 4 got truncated due to the output limit, so we need to retrieve the full line. Based on my earlier observations, line 4 may continue with more content, but it needs chunking because it's too long. I'll slice it appropriately to get all the pieces and manage multiple lines for clarity.

Measuring line length for truncation analysis
len(lines3[4]), len(lines3[5])

(999, 132)
Handling truncation by slicing line4
Line 4 is 999 characters long, so it's being split into multiple chunks. To ensure we capture the entire content for translation, I’ll slice it into 200-character pieces and analyze it sequentially. I'll store the pieces in local variables and print them one by one to avoid truncation.

Addressing truncation issue in slices
It looks like the tool truncation is still inserting ellipses ("...") inside each slice. To avoid this, I’ll try printing smaller 100-character slices instead of 200 to see if that resolves the issue. Hopefully, reducing the length will prevent truncation and keep things accurate.

I need to translate the Q&A segments, being careful with names and phrases. Some include "الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم" which I’ll translate and add ﷺ. I'll also ensure that terms like "اللهم" are translated properly—using "O Allah" rather than transliterated Arabic. For supplications, like "اللهم كن معي حياً وميتاً", I’ll translate it as "O Allah, be with me in life and death." Now, I'll list the segments.

Handling potential missing segment and translation plan
It looks like segment P6742b might be missing—P6742a has both the question and answer due to a possible typo. I’ll keep it as is for now. Our goal is to provide an English translation without Arabic, ensuring that hadith phrases and headings are correctly translated while maintaining clarity and flow throughout all segments.

Translating heading and diacritic choice for consistency
The heading is about the narrators in the chain of Ibn Masʿūd's hadith, specifically discussing the suckling that strengthens bones. I’ll use "Biographies of the narrators in the chain of the hadith of Ibn Masʿūd" without diacritics as it aligns with the user's request to avoid Arabic characters and keeps the terms accessible and clear.

Clarifying narrative details and transliteration choices
I'll keep the bracketed punctuation consistent, like in "ʿAbd al-Salām ibn Muṭahhar narrated to us." The names "al-Bukhārī" and "Abū Dāwūd" aren’t narrators but authors, so I’ll use "al-Bukhārī" and "Abū Dāwūd" without diacritics to maintain clarity. For "Sulaymān ibn al-Mughīrah," I'll stick to "trustworthy" and translate "Aṣḥāb al-kutub al-sittah" as "the authors of the six books."

Clarifying narration chains and terms
For "Abū Mūsā," I'll say he’s “acceptable” (maqbūl) but avoid over-explaining. For his father, I'll note that he's considered "unknown" as his name isn't mentioned. For Ibn Masʿūd, we’ll say he's a companion of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, and his hadith is cited by the six authors.

Clarifying Abu Musa's role in the narration
Abu Musa al-Ashʿari's mention here reflects his role in the matn, but he is not in the isnad—so we can keep it simple as "Abu Musa." The explanation includes an abridged version of the report, stating that it may mislead by implying Abu Musa is in the chain, but he's not. I'll refer to it as a "three-link chain."

Explaining the narrators and hadith chain details
The chain includes several names, so I should use ALA-LC transliteration with diacritics for accuracy. For example, "Muḥammad ibn Sulaymān al-Anbārī" followed by "Ibn Masʿūd." When mentioning the Prophet's name, I’ll use the phrase without transliteration, adding "may Allah be pleased with him" afterward. For the narrators, I'll describe their trustworthiness.

Explaining the hadith of adoption and suckling
This narration involves the adoption of Sālim by Abū Ḥudhayfah and how the Prophet ﷺ adjusted the concept of adoption per the Qur'anic revelation. After Sālim was treated as a son but the limits of this status were clarified, the wife of Abū Ḥudhayfah, Sahlah, nursed him to establish a proper familial relationship.

Clarifying transliteration and matn names
In this case, I'll follow the rule to transliterate narrator names with diacritics (e.g., Aḥmad ibn Ṣāliḥ, ʿUrwah ibn al-Zubayr) using ALA-LC standards. However, for names within the text—like Abū Ḥudhayfah, Sālim, and others—I'll omit diacritics, as they're part of the matn and not the chain of narration.

Translating hadith terminology and commentary
For names like "Zayd," I'll keep them plain, as they are not part of the chain. However, for narrators like "Aḥmad ibn Ṣāliḥ," I'll maintain the diacritics as required. I'll translate key terms like "mawlā" as "client," and explain differences in scholarly views on adult suckling carefully, especially Salim's case.

Clarifying the concept of adulthood, breastfeeding, and rulings
The key point is that five sucklings are important, and the milk should reach the stomach — whether by direct suckling or drinking. On Zayd's adoption, the verse specifies calling children by their father's name, except for cases like Zayd. It also touches on Sahlah's statement and Aisha's orders.

Discussing various rulings and questions
The key rulings include how a father should handle a son abandoning prayer, what to do when a woman commits fornication, and the permissibility of marriage after fornication. Other rulings address supplication, dowry, and the consequences of inciting divorce. Additionally, the marriage between a Muslim and a polytheist is not allowed.

Clarifying various rulings and translations
The question about a woman bringing simple household items from her parent's house to her husband's home was answered with no problem. As for preferences after Friday ʿAṣr, both attending a session of knowledge or remaining in prayer are fine. Next, we clarified that "shaykh" refers to al-Khaṭṭābī in Sunan Abu Dawud's commentary.

Inspecting specific segments
It looks like parts of P6746b, P6747, and P6748a got truncated. I'll focus on inspecting P6746b (which is part 44) first. By doing this, I can take a closer look at where things got cut off and figure out how to properly address them. Let's open that segment!

Ensuring accurate translation and transliteration
The translation must cover all segments, particularly Qur'an verses in P6730, P6731, and P6745, which I will translate, not just transliterate. I need to translate "الشيخ الألباني" as "Shaykh al-Albani" and "أمهات المؤمنين" as "Mothers of the Believers" while following ALA-LC with accurate diacritics and "ibn" for narrators’ names in the chain.

Mapping names and ensuring correct transliteration
I'll map the following names correctly:

ʿAbd al-Salām ibn Muṭahhar

Sulaymān ibn al-Mughīrah

Abū Mūsā al-Hilālī

ʿAbd Allāh ibn Masʿūd

Muḥammad ibn Sulaymān al-Anbārī

Wakīʿ ibn al-Jarrāḥ al-Ruʾāsī

Aḥmad ibn Ṣāliḥ (al-Miṣrī)

ʿAnbasah ibn Khālid al-Aylī

Yūnus ibn Yazīd al-Aylī

Ibn Shihāb: Muḥammad ibn Muslim ibn ʿUbayd Allāh ibn Shihāb al-Zuhrī

ʿUrwah ibn al-Zubayr

ʿĀʾishah

Umm Salamah

For "Ibn Shihāb," I'll keep it as it appears in the chain: "Ibn Shihāb" for consistency in transliteration.

Translating and formatting the hadith chain
For the hadith chain: "Aḥmad ibn Ṣāliḥ narrated to us; ʿAnbasah narrated to us; Yūnus narrated to me; from Ibn Shihāb; ʿUrwah ibn al-Zubayr narrated to me..."

I'll keep the names and relations consistent and in the ALA-LC system, using semicolons to separate the chain elements instead of Arabic punctuation or digits. Arabic characters and numerals will not appear in the final output.

Preparing the final translation output
I’ll convert bracketed verses like "Qur'an 33:5" to use Western numerals and ensure no Arabic quotation marks are used. Also, I’ll avoid Arabic script in verse references and deliver the text in plain format with line breaks. I’ll make sure to include "Allah" where needed and note the translation for "إلى قوله" as "up to His statement."

Final translation for hadith narration segment
I’ll be translating "فضلى" as "in a state of undress" but will keep the explanation in mind as it’s clarified as "in her work clothes" elsewhere in the Hadith. The segment, "and he sees me without full covering," translates literally but clarified in the context. I’ll ensure no markdown and structure the output with blank lines between segments for readability. Time to craft the full translation now!

Clarifying transliteration and chain structure
I’m working through the translation and how transliteration is applied. In this case, the narration mentions Abu Musa al-Ashʿari but the report implies it’s a different name in the chain: Abū Mūsā al-Hilālī. I’ll stick with ALA-LC for the narrators, avoiding diacritics for names outside the chain like Abu Musa al-Ash'ari. It’ll be clearer that way!

Clarifying transliteration choices for narrator names
I’ll stick with ALA-LC for the names of narrators in the chain like Ibn Masʿūd. For other names, like Abu Musa al-Ashʿari, which aren't in the chain, I’ll avoid diacritics and use standard transliterations. For names outside the chain but relevant to the context, I’ll be careful to adjust.

Translating chain names and commentary with care
For P6728 I'll use ALA-LC transliteration for chain names, like "Wakīʿ" with its diacritic 'ī' and final 'ʿ'. I'll follow the same for other names like "al-Ruʾāsī", "al-Jarrāḥ", and "ʿĀʾishah", making sure to use semicolons in the commentary. I'll also keep ALA-LC for "Abu Dawud" and avoid diacritics for "Umm Salamah".

Handling translation of titles and names
For P6730, I'll translate "باب من حرم به" as "Chapter: Whoever is made unlawful thereby" and keep the bracket style as in the original. I'll ensure terms like "al-Tirmidhi in (Prophetic Characteristics)" are used without Arabic in parentheses. For names like "Izzat Ubayd al-Da’as" and "al-Khattabi," I'll use standard transliteration without curly braces.

Clarifying naming conventions and translations
I need to make sure I follow the guideline correctly, using ALA-LC transliteration for Arabic names of narrators, while Arabic letters themselves shouldn't show up. So names should be like “Abu Dawud” without diacritics, but I use ALA-LC with correct diacritics when in chains. I'll translate chapter headings and verses into English, using "Allah" for God unless referring to a different term (ilāh).

Translating hadith text and narration chains
For hadith translations, "رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم" becomes "the Messenger of Allah ﷺ," and "رضي الله عنه" is translated as "may Allah be pleased with him," especially for companions. I'll preserve the hadith chains in standard form, using ALA-LC transliteration like “Ibrāhīm ibn Muḥammad al-Taymī” and avoid adding unnecessary details.

Translating narrators and matn names
The name "يحيى" should be transliterated as "Yaḥyā" without the last name since it's not specified in the chain. For names in the matn like "مرثد بن أبي مرثد الغنوي," even though it's part of the story content, no transliteration is needed because it's not within the narration chain. We'll just translate for clarity.

Transliteration choices for narrators and names in matn
I'll use simplified transliteration without diacritics for names in the matn, like "Marthad ibn Abi Marthad al-Ghanawi," since the instructions specify using ALA-LC only for chain narrators. For commentary, simplified transliteration seems fine, but I’ll stick to the instructions and avoid using ALA-LC outside of the chain. If names are part of the isnād, I’ll treat them accordingly.

Transliterating names in isnad and commentary
The instructions are clear about using ALA-LC transliteration only for names of narrators in the isnad (chain). So, I'll apply ALA-LC to narrator names in the chain, but not in the commentary or matn unless the name also appears in the chain. For narrator identification outside the chain, simplified transliteration is safer.

Handling transliterations and citation formatting
In the tarajim sections, I'd keep ALA-LC for narrator names, since they quote chain segments. Similarly, even in sentences identifying narrators, ALA-LC should stay for consistency. For companions in the matn (like Marthad), I'd avoid diacritics. As for citations, I'll follow the instructions to include a citation string at the end in plain text, without markdown.

P6715 - شرح سنن أبي داود [٢٣٧]
لقد بيّن الشرع أنه يحرم من الرضاعة ما يحرم من النسب، وأن أحكام الرضاعة كأحكام النسب، فالمرضعة تصير أماً للرضيع، وزوجها -وهو صاحب اللبن- يصير أباً للرضيع، وأولادها يصيرون إخواناً للرضيع، وهكذا تنتشر المحرمية في الأصول والفروع.

Checking ellipsis in the file
It looks like there’s an ellipsis ("...") in the text, but in the file_search snippet there wasn't any. It's possible the ellipsis is due to tool truncation, but it might also actually be part of the original text. I’ll check around that part to better understand whether it’s part of the content.

Inspecting ellipsis occurrences in text

Clarifying truncation issue
It looks like the ellipsis wasn't part of the actual text—it was just how I seen it printed. I used print in Python, and it got truncated, showing 'وخ...'. I wondered if that's because of the notebook's display. I'll print the problematic text segment directly to check it more carefully.

Checking for unprintable characters
The text shows 'خ...' again. It might be that the file actually contains 'وخـ' and something unprintable could be happening. I’ll look at earlier parts of the file, checking its bytes directly. I’ll print the repr to better understand if there is an issue with any hidden characters.

segment=txt[start:start+100]
repr(segment)

"'هو أنس بن مالك رضي الله عنه صاحب رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم وخادمه، وأحد السبعة المعروفين بكثرة ال'"
Handling Arabic script and cited elements
It turns out the text is "وخادمه" but got truncated earlier due to output limitations; that "..." just masked it. For the number ٢٣٧ in Arabic digits, we need to convert it to Western digits — instructions say no Arabic characters outside of ﷺ. So, "النور: ٣" should become "al-Nur: 3" or "Surat al-Nur: 3". I'll use "al-Nur: 3". No diacritics on Surah names since it isn't part of the chain.

Handling translations from Arabic to English
The bracketed number [٢٣٧] will be converted to [237] for consistency. Also, curly braces containing Quranic verses in Arabic need translation. For example, "{الزَّانِي لا يَنكِحُ إلَّا زَانِيَةً} [النور: ٣]" should become, "The fornicator does not marry except a fornicatress...". Regarding "الزاني," "fornicator" fits best, and "fornicatress" for females. For terms like "بغي" (prostitute), I’ll use "prostitute" to preserve technical accuracy.

Translating hadith terminology carefully
In topics like jarh wa ta'dil, terms like "thiqa" (trustworthy) or "ṣadūq" (truthful) are common, but how should I present them? The instructions don't forbid transliteration of technical terms, so "thiqa" and "ṣadūq" might be fine to use. I’ll be cautious about context and avoid diacritics, following guidelines about how to handle Arabic terms.

Using transliteration for technical terms
I’m thinking about how to handle terms like "thiqa" and "saduq"—should I translate them, or keep them as transliterated words? "Trustworthy" and "truthful" might be good enough equivalents, and keeping "Allah" spelled correctly seems important. For narrator names, I’ll definitely use the ALA-LC format as instructed.

Translating titles and text
I'm thinking of how to handle terms like "أصحاب الكتب الستة" (the authors of the Six Books) and "جزء القراءة" (Juz' al-Qira'ah). For titles, I'll opt for translation instead of transliteration to fit the style. I’ll preserve important terms like “Allah the Exalted” rather than using God. Each section with IDs will be translated carefully while keeping numbering intact.

Translating Qur'an citations and hadith
For the Qur'an, I’ll provide the translation of the verse about fornicators: “The fornicator does not marry except a fornicatress or an idolatress.” I’ll also preserve footnotes and ensure parentheses are translated clearly. Additionally, I’ll use the prescribed translation for phrases like "the Prophet ﷺ" and not add any extra details. Similar rules apply for terms like "رضي الله عنه."

Translating scholarly views on fornication and marriage
Some scholars say a chaste person can't marry a fornicatress, citing the hadith where only a like-fornicatress marries another fornicatress. They also mention "waty'" (illicit intercourse) as a clearer concept. I'll use "sexual intercourse (i.e., illicit sex)" to describe this. For the narrator biographies, I'll translate their titles and terms like "truthful" for "ṣadūq," avoiding diacritics.

Translating and transliterating narrator names and hadith
I'll translate terms like "trustworthy" and "a noble Companion" and transliterate narrator names using ALA-LC as required. For examples like "Musaddad" and "Abū Muʿammar," I'll include proper diacritics. Translating hadith and commentary on meaning, I'll ensure consistency and preserve formatting. For narrator biographies, I'll apply ALA-LC too, sticking to instructions. I'll translate the hadith about emancipation and Safiyyah and keep simplified versions for non-narrator names.

Deciding on transliteration and quality considerations
For Islamic names like "Safiyyah" and "Huyayy ibn Akhtab," I'll use simplified transliteration without diacritics for readability. Even though the user requested ALA-LC for chain names, I'll stick to simpler versions. Also, for "rubāʿī" (four narrators), I won't add diacritics. I'll continue translating everything carefully, avoiding Arabic script and ensuring proper conversion of Quran citations.

Preparing translation with correct formatting and transliteration
I'll craft translations for each segment, making sure to preserve quoted headings and numeric markers like [al-Nur: 32]. I'll avoid Arabic digits, use Western numerals, and maintain curly braces for verse citations like {And marry off...}. For transliteration, I'll follow ALA-LC for narrator names and ensure proper diacritics like ḥ, ʿ, ā, ī, ū, ṣ, ṭ, ḍ, etc.

Confirming correct transliterations of names
I’ll confirm the transliterations for the names, such as:

Ibrāhīm ibn Muḥammad al-Taymī for إبراهيم بن محمد التيمي.

Yaḥyā for يحيى.

Musaddad for مسدد, etc.

For "عبثر", I’ll go with "ʿAbthar," since the letter 'ث' corresponds to "th".

I'll ensure clarity and consistency with these transliterations throughout.

Confirming elaborated transliterations
Now working on the names and ensuring proper transliterations for consistency, such as:

ʿAbthar for "عبثر."

Muṭarrif for "مطرف."

ʿĀmir for "عامر."

Abū Burdah for "أبو بردة."

For full names, I’ll follow ALA-LC too, like Yaḥyā ibn Saʿīd al-Qaṭṭān (with the correct shaʿddah on ṭ) and ʿAbd al-Wārith ibn Saʿīd al-ʿAnbarī. I’m clear on these now.

Confirming transliterations for narrator names
For narrator names, I’m confirming the ALA-LC transliterations:

Musaddad ibn Musarhad for "مسدد بن مسرهد."

ʿAbd Allāh ibn ʿAmr ibn Abī al-Ḥajjāj for "عبد الله بن عمرو بن أبي الحجاج."

Qatādah ibn Diʿāmah al-Sadūsī al-Baṣrī for "قتادة بن دعامة السدوسي البصري."

ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ibn Ṣakhr al-Dawsī for "عبد الرحمن بن صخر الدوسي."

For author names, I’ll use "Abu Dawud al-Sijistani" without diacritics.

Finalizing translation approach
For the translation, I'll avoid including diacritics for scholars like "Shaykh Muhammad al-Amin al-Shinqiti," although the user might accept it given his specialization. I'll also translate Arabic phrases like "رحمه الله تعالى" to "may Allah have mercy on him" and "التوبة تجب ما قبلها" to "repentance wipes out what came before it."

P6705 - Explanation of the ḥadīth of the Prophet ﷺ forbidding Marthad from marrying the prostitute ʿAnāq
The author, may Allah have mercy on him, said: [Chapter: Concerning Allah the Exalted’s statement: {The fornicator does not marry except a fornicatress} (al-Nur: 3).
Ibrāhīm ibn Muḥammad al-Taymī narrated to us; Yaḥyā narrated to us, from ʿUbayd Allāh ibn al-Akhnas, from ʿAmr ibn Shuʿayb, from his father, from his grandfather, may Allah be pleased with him, that Marthad ibn Abī Marthad al-Ghanawī used to carry captives in Makkah. There was in Makkah a prostitute called ʿAnāq, and she had been his companion. He said: (I came to the Prophet ﷺ and said: O Messenger of Allah! Shall I marry ʿAnāq? He remained silent regarding me. Then it was revealed: {The fornicatress—none marries her except a fornicator or an idolater} (al-Nur: 3). So he called me, recited it to me, and said: Do not marry her).]
Imam Abu Dawud al-Sijistani, may Allah have mercy on him, said: [Chapter: Concerning Allah the Exalted’s statement: {The fornicatress—none marries her except a fornicator or an idolater} (al-Nur: 3).]
This noble verse indicates that the fornicator does not marry except a fornicatress or an idolatress, and the fornicatress is not married except by a fornicator or an idolater. Abu Dawud mentioned this chapter heading and cited this ḥadīth under it to make clear that marriage to a fornicatress is not permissible, due to the Prophet’s ﷺ prohibition of it.

P6706 - The ruling on marrying a fornicatress and the statements of the scholars concerning it
The scholars have differed regarding the ruling of marrying a fornicatress. Some of them said that it is permissible for a chaste man to marry a fornicatress, because she is among the slave-women of the Muslims and among the unmarried women about whom Allah the Exalted said: {Marry off the unmarried among you} (al-Nur: 32); so that includes fornicatresses and others besides fornicatresses.
Some of the people of knowledge said that the chaste man does not marry the fornicatress; rather, only a fornicator like her marries her. In the ḥadīth that comes after this there occurs: (A flogged fornicator does not marry except one like him). Its meaning, then, is that the chaste man does not marry the fornicatress, and the fornicator may marry the fornicatress, because their occupying themselves with what is lawful is better than their occupying themselves with what is unlawful.
Among the scholars are those who said that this noble verse is not about marriage, but rather it is about intercourse; its intent is that the fornicator does not have intercourse with a fornicatress or an idolatress—meaning, he does not commit fornication except with a fornicatress or an idolatress. So “nikāḥ” here is meant as intercourse, because Allah said: “except a fornicator or an idolater.” They said: the idolater has been mentioned, and an idolater can in no case contract marriage to a Muslim woman; it is not permissible for an idolater to marry a Muslim woman, nor is it permissible for a Muslim woman to marry an idolater. So they said: “nikāḥ” here is meant as intercourse. On this, the fornicator does not have intercourse except with a fornicatress—meaning, an immoral woman like him—or an idolatress who does not acknowledge lawful and unlawful. Likewise the reverse: “and the fornicatress—none has intercourse with her except a fornicator” like her “or an idolater” who does not distinguish between lawful and unlawful and deems fornication lawful.
They said: so the mention of the idolater here indicates that what is meant is intercourse.
But the ḥadīth the author cited here regarding the reason for the revelation of the verse—that the Messenger ﷺ recited it to him and said: (Do not marry her)—indicates that what is meant is marriage.
Our shaykh, Shaykh Muhammad al-Amin al-Shinqiti, may Allah have mercy on him, spoke about this verse in Adwa’ al-Bayan and said: this is among the most difficult issues, because the contextual indicator in the verse shows that what is meant by “nikāḥ” is intercourse, while the reason for revelation shows that what is meant by “nikāḥ” is marriage. He said: escaping—meaning, from this difficulty—is hard and is not achieved except with a kind of strain and contrivance. Then he pointed to something of that and said: “nikāḥ” is carried as a shared term between the two meanings: it is used for intercourse and it is used for marriage; so what is meant by it is marriage in one respect and intercourse in another.
The meaning of that is that if what is intended by it is intercourse in fornication, that is due to the indication of the mention of the idolater; so what is intended is intercourse due to the contextual indicator of mentioning the idolater. And the ḥadīth in which the Prophet ﷺ forbade him to marry her indicates that what is intended is marriage. Thus the verse is explained by both meanings and carried on both meanings that the wording indicates by its shared usage: intercourse and marriage.
The upshot is that marriage to a fornicatress by a chaste man is not permissible, as the ḥadīth indicates. As for the marriage of a fornicator to a fornicatress, it is allowable, due to his ﷺ statement: (A flogged fornicator does not marry except one like him) in the forthcoming ḥadīth. His statement: “flogged” means that his fornication has become apparent and established by the presence of flogging for it; so the fornicator whose fornication has been established does not marry except one like him.
What appears is that the chaste man does not marry the immoral fornicatress; as for the fornicator, he marries her instead of the two of them occupying themselves with what is unlawful.
As for the ḥadīth, it contains that Marthad ibn Abī Marthad al-Ghanawī came to the Prophet ﷺ, and he used to carry captives from Makkah to Madinah. There was in Makkah a prostitute called ʿAnāq, and she had been his companion. He sought the Prophet’s ﷺ permission to marry her, so he recited the verse to him and said to him: (Do not marry her). This indicates that it is not permissible for the chaste man to marry the fornicatress, and that the fornicator may marry the fornicatress who is like him. As for the idolater, it is not permissible for him to marry a Muslim woman at all, due to the texts of the Book and the Sunnah regarding that.
What is meant by the chaste man not marrying the fornicatress is before her repentance. As for when she repents, then repentance wipes out what came before it, and Allah the Exalted accepts repentance from whoever repents; and the chaste man may marry her.

P6707 - Biographies of the men in the chain of the ḥadīth of the Prophet ﷺ forbidding Marthad from marrying the prostitute ʿAnāq
His statement: [Ibrāhīm ibn Muḥammad al-Taymī narrated to us.]
Ibrāhīm ibn Muḥammad al-Taymī is trustworthy; Abu Dawud and al-Nasa’i narrated from him.
[Yaḥyā narrated to us.]
He is Yaḥyā ibn Saʿīd al-Qaṭṭān, trustworthy; the authors of the Six Books narrated from him.
[From ʿUbayd Allāh ibn al-Akhnas.]
ʿUbayd Allāh ibn al-Akhnas is truthful; the authors of the Six Books narrated from him.
[From ʿAmr ibn Shuʿayb.]
He is ʿAmr ibn Shuʿayb ibn Muḥammad ibn ʿAbd Allāh ibn ʿAmr ibn al-ʿĀṣ; he is truthful. Al-Bukhari narrated from him in the treatise on recitation, and the authors of the Sunan.
[From his father.]
He is Shuʿayb; he is truthful. Al-Bukhari narrated from him in the treatise on recitation and in al-Adab al-Mufrad, and the authors of the Sunan.
[From his grandfather.]
He is Shuʿayb’s grandfather, and he is ʿAbd Allāh ibn ʿAmr ibn al-ʿĀṣ, may Allah be pleased with them both, the noble Companion—one of the four ʿAbd Allāhs among the Companions of the Prophet ﷺ. The authors of the Six Books narrated his ḥadīth.

P6708 - Explanation of the ḥadīth: (A flogged fornicator does not marry except one like him)
The author, may Allah have mercy on him, said: [Musaddad and Abū Muʿammar said: ʿAbd al-Wārith narrated to us, from Ḥabīb—ʿAmr ibn Shuʿayb narrated to me, from Saʿīd al-Maqburī, from Abū Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, that he said: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: (A flogged fornicator does not marry except one like him).]
Abu Dawud cited the ḥadīth of Abū Hurayrah: (A flogged fornicator does not marry except one like him). This indicates that the fornicator marries the fornicatress, and that is in the state where both are not repentant. As for when they have repented, then repentance wipes out what came before it; the chaste man may marry the fornicatress if she repents, and likewise the reverse.
His statement: “flogged” means: the one upon whom the legal punishment has been carried out and whose fornication has been established. It has no contrary implication in the sense that the one who was not flogged would not be like that; rather, he is the same. It only mentioned “flogged” because through it the existence of fornication is established. Flogging is an expiation for him, but if he does not repent then it is an expiation for the sin that occurred from him only; as for if he persists, then the flogging does not expiate his persistence, nor is he married to a chaste woman. But if it happens that a fornicator contracts marriage to a chaste woman, the contract is valid, and it is not said that the contract is invalid—though he is not a suitable match for her.
As for the chaste man, many scholars permitted him to marry the fornicatress, using as evidence Allah the Exalted’s statement: {Marry off the unmarried among you} (al-Nur: 32).

P6709 - Biographies of the men in the chain of the ḥadīth: (A flogged fornicator does not marry except one like him)
His statement: [He said: Musaddad narrated to us.]
He is Musaddad ibn Musarhad, trustworthy; al-Bukhari, Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi, and al-Nasa’i narrated from him.
[And Abū Muʿammar.]

[ʿAbd al-Wārith narrated to us.]
He is ʿAbd al-Wārith ibn Saʿīd al-ʿAnbarī, trustworthy; the authors of the Six Books narrated from him.
[From Ḥabīb.]
He is Ḥabīb al-Muʿallim, truthful; the authors of the Six Books narrated from him.
[From ʿAmr ibn Shuʿayb, from Saʿīd al-Maqburī.]
ʿAmr ibn Shuʿayb has already been mentioned. Saʿīd al-Maqburī is trustworthy; the authors of the Six Books narrated from him.
[From Abū Hurayrah.]
He is ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ibn Ṣakhr al-Dawsī, the Companion of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, and the most prolific of his Companions in ḥadīth without exception—may Allah be pleased with him.
And Abū Muʿammar said: Ḥabīb al-Muʿallim narrated to me, from ʿAmr ibn Shuʿayb.
Meaning: the wording he cited is upon the wording of the first shaykh, Musaddad. Then he informed about the second shaykh: the narration from Abū Muʿammar came with the additional word “al-Muʿallim” appended to Ḥabīb. Also, the first was with the wording “from,” while here it is with the wording of direct narration.

P6710 - A man frees his slave-girl, then marries her

P6711 - Explanation of the ḥadīth: (Whoever frees his slave-girl, then marries her, has two rewards)
The author, may Allah have mercy on him, said: [Chapter: A man frees his slave-girl, then marries her.
Hannād ibn al-Sarī narrated to us; ʿAbthar narrated to us, from Muṭarrif, from ʿĀmir, from Abū Burdah, from Abū Mūsā, may Allah be pleased with him, that he said: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: (Whoever frees his slave-girl and marries her has two rewards).]
Abu Dawud cited this chapter heading—[Chapter: A man frees his slave-girl and marries her]—meaning: that this is valid and contains tremendous reward. That is because the Prophet ﷺ said, as in the ḥadīth of Abū Mūsā: (He has two rewards), meaning: a reward for emancipating her and a reward for his kindness to her through emancipation and marriage. He married her, and she came to have a right to an allotted turn, after previously having no allotted turn. He treated her well by transferring her from a state in which she had no allotted turn to a state in which she is among the wives who are allotted turns. So he has two rewards: a reward for emancipating her and his kindness to her through emancipation, and a reward for his kindness to her through marriage and her becoming among his wives who have the right to an allotted turn.

P6712 - Biographies of the men in the chain of the ḥadīth: (Whoever frees his slave-girl, then marries her, has two rewards)
His statement: [Hannād ibn al-Sarī narrated to us.]
He is Hannād ibn al-Sarī Abū al-Sarī, trustworthy. Al-Bukhari narrated his ḥadīth in Khalq Afʿāl al-ʿIbād, and so did Muslim and the authors of the Sunan.
[ʿAbthar narrated to us.]
ʿAbthar is trustworthy; the authors of the Six Books narrated from him.
[From Muṭarrif.]
He is Muṭarrif ibn Ṭarīf, trustworthy; the authors of the Six Books narrated from him.
[From ʿĀmir.]
He is ʿĀmir ibn Sharāḥīl al-Shaʿbī, trustworthy; the authors of the Six Books narrated from him.
[From Abū Burdah.]
He is Abū Burdah ibn Abī Mūsā al-Ashʿarī, trustworthy; the authors of the Six Books narrated from him.
[From Abū Mūsā.]
He is Abū Mūsā al-Ashʿarī ʿAbd Allāh ibn Qays, may Allah be pleased with him. The authors of the Six Books narrated his ḥadīth. Thus, all the men of this chain are narrated from by the authors of the Six Books except for Hannād; al-Bukhari did not narrate from him in the Ṣaḥīḥ, but he narrated from him in Khalq Afʿāl al-ʿIbād.

P6713 - Explanation of the ḥadīth of the Prophet’s ﷺ emancipating Safiyyah and making her emancipation her dower
The author, may Allah have mercy on him, said: [ʿAmr ibn ʿAwn narrated to us; Abū ʿAwānah informed us, from Qatādah and ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz ibn Ṣuhayb, from Anas ibn Mālik, may Allah be pleased with him: (that the Prophet ﷺ emancipated Safiyyah, may Allah be pleased with her, and made her emancipation her dower).]
Abu Dawud cited the ḥadīth of Anas ibn Malik, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Prophet ﷺ married Safiyyah and made her emancipation her dower. Safiyyah is the daughter of Huyayy ibn Akhtab, may Allah be pleased with her, the Mother of the Believers. She had been a slave-girl, so he emancipated her, and the Prophet ﷺ made her emancipation her dower. This indicates what the author translated the chapter for: emancipation and marriage, and that by doing so he has shown two kinds of kindness, and that it is permissible to make emancipation a dower because it is a favor he bestowed upon her.
The scholars differed as to whether this is specific to the Messenger ﷺ or whether it is for him and others. Saying that it is a special characteristic requires evidence; the correct view is that it is allowable and permissible, and that it is not among the special characteristics of the Messenger ﷺ.
His statement: (He emancipated Safiyyah and made her emancipation her dower) means: he emancipated her and married her, and her emancipation is her dower.

P6714 - Biographies of the men in the chain of the ḥadīth of the Prophet’s ﷺ emancipating Safiyyah and making her emancipation her dower
His statement: [ʿAmr ibn ʿAwn narrated to us.]
ʿAmr ibn ʿAwn is trustworthy; the authors of the Six Books narrated from him.
[Abū ʿAwānah informed us.]
He is al-Waḍḍāḥ ibn ʿAbd Allāh al-Yashkurī, trustworthy; the authors of the Six Books narrated from him.
[From Qatādah.]
He is Qatādah ibn Diʿāmah al-Sadūsī al-Baṣrī, trustworthy; the authors of the Six Books narrated from him.
[And ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz ibn Ṣuhayb.]
ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz ibn Ṣuhayb is trustworthy; the authors of the Six Books narrated from him.
[From Anas ibn Mālik.]
He is Anas ibn Mālik, may Allah be pleased with him, the Companion of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and his servant, and one of the seven known for abundant narration from the Prophet ﷺ.
This chain is four-linked: Qatādah and ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz are in one rank, so it is a four-linked chain, and it is among the highest chains with Abu Dawud.

P6715 - Explanation of Sunan Abi Dawud [237]
The Sacred Law has made clear that what becomes unlawful due to suckling is the same as what becomes unlawful due to lineage, and that the rulings of suckling are like the rulings of lineage: the wet-nurse becomes a mother to the suckling child, her husband—who is the owner of the milk—becomes a father to the child, her children become siblings to the child, and in this manner the prohibition of marriage spreads through ascendants and descendants.

P6705 - شرح حديث نهي النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم مرثداً عن نكاح البغي عناق
قال المصنف رحمه الله تعالى: [باب في قوله تعالى: {الزَّانِي لا يَنكِحُ إلَّا زَانِيَةً} [النور: ٣].
حدثنا إبراهيم بن محمد التيمي حدثنا يحيى عن عبيد الله بن الأخنس عن عمرو بن شعيب عن أبيه عن جده رضي الله عنه أن مرثد بن أبي مرثد الغنوي كان يحمل الأسارى بمكة، وكان بمكة بغي يقال لها: عناق، وكانت صديقته، قال: (جئت إلى النبي صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم فقلت: يا رسول الله! أنكح عناقاً؟ قال: فسكت عني، فنزلت: {وَالزَّانِيَةُ لا يَنكِحُهَا إِلَّا زَانٍ أَوْ مُشْرِكٌ} [النور: ٣]، فدعاني فقرأها علي وقال: لا تنكحها)].
قال الإمام أبو داود السجستاني رحمه الله تعالى: [باب في قوله تعالى: {وَالزَّانِيَةُ لا يَنكِحُهَا إِلَّا زَانٍ أَوْ مُشْرِكٌ} [النور: ٣]].
هذه الآية الكريمة تدل على أن الزاني لا ينكح إلا زانية أو مشركة، والزانية لا ينكحها إلا زان أو مشرك، وقد ذكر أبو داود هذه الترجمة وأورد هذا الحديث تحتها لبيان أن الزواج بالزانية لا يجوز؛ لنهي النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم عنه.

----
P6706 - حكم الزواج بالزانية وأقوال العلماء فيه
وقد اختلف العلماء في حكم الزواج بالزانية: فمنهم من قال: إنه يجوز أن يتزوج العفيف بالزانية؛ لأنها من جملة إماء المسلمين وجملة الأيامى اللاتي قال الله تعالى فيهن: {وَأَنكِحُوا الأَيَامَى مِنْكُمْ} [النور: ٣٢]، فيدخل في ذلك الزواني وغير الزواني.
وقال بعض أهل العلم: إن العفيف لا ينكح الزانية، وإنما ينكحها زانٍ مثلها، وقد جاء في الحديث الذي بعد هذا: (لا ينكح الزاني المجلود إلا مثله)، فمعناه إذاً أن العفيف لا يتزوج الزانية، وأن الزاني له أن يتزوج الزانية؛ لأن اشتغالهما بالحلال خير من اشتغالهما بالحرام.
ومن العلماء من قال: إن هذه الآية الكريمة ليست في الزواج وإنما هي في الوطء، والمقصود بها أن الزاني لا يطأ زانية أو مشركة، أي: لا يزني إلا بزانية أو مشركة، فالمراد بالنكاح هنا الوطء؛ لأن الله قال: «إِلَّا زَانٍ أَوْ مُشْرِكٌ» قالوا: فقد جاء ذكر المشرك، والمشرك لا يمكن بحال أن يعقد على مسلمة، فلا يجوز للمشرك أن يتزوج مسلمة ولا يجوز للمسلمة أن ينكحها مشرك، فقالوا: فالنكاح هنا يراد به الوطء، وعلى هذا فالزاني لا يطأ إلا زانية، يعني: فاجرة مثله، أو مشركة

P6708 - شرح حديث (لا ينكح الزاني المجلود إلا مثله)
قال المصنف رحمه الله تعالى: [حدثنا مسدد وأبو معمر قالا: حدثنا عبد الوارث عن حبيب حدثني عمرو بن شعيب عن سعيد المقبري عن أبي هريرة رضي الله عنه أنه قال: قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم: (لا ينكح الزاني المجلود إلا مثله).
أورد أبو داود حديث أبي هريرة: [(لا ينكح الزاني المجلود إلا مثله)] وهذا يدل على أن الزاني ينكح الزانية، وذلك في حال كونهما غير تائبين، وأما إذا كانا قد تابا فإن التوبة تجب ما قبلها، فالعفيف له أن يتزوج الزانية إذا تابت، وكذلك العكس.
وقوله: (المجلود) أي: الذي أقيم عليه الحد وتحقق زناه، وليس له مفهوم من ناحية أن الذي لم يجلد لا يكون كذلك بل هو مثله، فالمجلود وغير المجلود سواء، لكنه ذكر المجلود لأن به تحقق وجود الزنا، والجلد كفارة له، لكن إذا لم يتب كان كفارة عن الذنب الذي حصل منه فحسب، أما إذا أصر فلا يكفر الجلد إصراره ولا يزوج بالعفيفة، ولكن إن حصل أن زانياً عقد له على عفيفة فإنه يصلح العقد ولا يقال: إن العقد باطل، وإن كان ليس كفؤاً لها.

P6713 - شرح حديث إعتاق النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم صفية وجعله عتقها صداقها

أورد أبو داود حديث أنس بن مالك رضي الله عنه أن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم تزوج صفية وجعل عتقها صداقها، وصفية هي بنت حيي بن أخطب رضي الله عنها أم المؤمنين، وقد كانت أمة فاعتقها، فالنبي صلى الله عليه وسلم وجعل عتقها صداقها، فدل ذلك على ما ترجم له المصنف من الإعتاق والزواج، وأنه يكون قد أحسن بذلك إحسانين، وأنه يجوز أن يجعل العتق صداقاً؛ لأنه نعمة أنعم بها عليها، وقد اختلف العلماء في ذلك هل هو خاص بالرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم أم أنه له ولغيره، والقول بالخصوصية يحتاج إلى دليل، فالصحيح أن ذلك سائغ وجائز، وأنه ليس من خصائص الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم.

P6715 - شرح سنن أبي داود [٢٣٧]
لقد بيّن الشرع أنه يحرم من الرضاعة ما يحرم من النسب، وأن أحكام الرضاعة كأحكام النسب، فالمرضعة تصير أماً للرضيع، وزوجها -وهو صاحب اللبن- يصير أباً للرضيع، وأولادها يصيرون إخواناً للرضيع، وهكذا تنتشر المحرمية في الأصول والفروع.
Handling truncated output and segment handling
It seems the output is getting truncated due to the environment's limits, so I'll print each segment fully but keep the timing under 45 seconds. If truncation happens, I'll split the segments and use repr to get full visibility for each one. I'll handle larger segments like P6705 individually for clarity.

P6705 - شرح حديث نهي النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم مرثداً عن نكاح البغي عناق
قال المصنف رحمه الله تعالى: [باب في قوله تعالى: {الزَّانِي لا يَنكِحُ إلَّا زَانِيَةً} [النور: ٣].
حدثنا إبراهيم بن محمد التيمي حدثنا يحيى عن عبيد الله بن الأخنس عن عمرو بن شعيب عن أبيه عن جده رضي الله عنه أن مرثد بن أبي مرثد الغنوي كان يحمل الأسارى بمكة، وكان بمكة بغي يقال لها: عناق، وكانت صديقته، قال: (جئت إلى النبي صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم فقلت: يا رسول الله! أنكح عناقاً؟ قال: فسكت عني، فنزلت: {وَالزَّانِيَةُ لا يَنكِحُهَا إِلَّا زَانٍ أَوْ مُشْرِكٌ} [النور: ٣]، فدعاني فقرأها علي وقال: لا تنكحها)].
قال الإمام أبو داود السجستاني رحمه الله تعالى: [باب في قوله تعالى: {وَالزَّانِيَةُ لا يَنكِحُهَا إِلَّا زَانٍ أَوْ مُشْرِكٌ} [النور: ٣]].
هذه الآية الكريمة تدل على أن الزاني لا ينكح إلا زانية أو مشركة، والزانية لا ينكحها إلا زان أو مشرك، وقد ذكر أبو داود هذه الترجمة وأورد هذا الحديث تحتها لبيان أن الزواج بالزانية لا يجوز؛ لنهي النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم عنه.

Handling Jupyter truncation and text slicing
The print output in Jupyter seems truncated with "..." due to interface limitations, but I'll bypass it by accessing the full text directly from the original file. I’ll slice it into pieces and translate each part, focusing on ensuring the complete content is captured without using truncated portions.

Printing full line 2
The current line is 406 characters long, and it should be displayable despite possible output limits. I’ll go ahead and print line 2 fully, as it doesn't exceed the expected limit. Hopefully, that will give me the complete, uninterrupted content for translation.

حدثنا إبراهيم بن محمد التيمي حدثنا يحيى عن عبيد الله بن الأخنس عن عمرو بن شعيب عن أبيه عن جده رضي الله عنه أن مرثد بن أبي مرثد الغنوي كان يحمل الأسارى بمكة، وكان بمكة بغي يقال لها: عناق، وكانت صديقته، قال: (جئت إلى النبي صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم فقلت: يا رسول الله! أنكح عناقاً؟ قال: فسكت عني، فنزلت: {وَالزَّانِيَةُ لا يَنكِحُهَا إِلَّا زَانٍ أَوْ مُشْرِكٌ} [النور: ٣]، فدعاني فقرأها علي وقال: لا تنكحها)].
Handling line truncation
It seems the output is still being truncated due to the line length, especially with Arabic text. I'll break line 2 down into smaller chunks and print each one sequentially. This approach should ensure I capture everything properly without hitting the output limit.

LINE 1
وقد اختلف العلماء في حكم الزواج بالزانية: فمنهم من قال: إنه يجوز أن يتزوج العفيف بالزانية؛ لأنها من جملة إماء المسلمين و
جملة الأيامى اللاتي قال الله تعالى فيهن: {وَأَنكِحُوا الأَيَامَى مِنْكُمْ} [النور: ٣٢]، فيدخل في ذلك الزواني وغير الزوان
ي.

LINE 2
وقال بعض أهل العلم: إن العفيف لا ينكح الزانية، وإنما ينكحها زانٍ مثلها، وقد جاء في الحديث الذي بعد هذا: (لا ينكح الزاني 
المجلود إلا مثله)، فمعناه إذاً أن العفيف لا يتزوج الزانية، وأن الزاني له أن يتزوج الزانية؛ لأن اشتغالهما بالحلال خير من 
اشتغالهما بالحرام.

LINE 3
ومن العلماء من قال: إن هذه الآية الكريمة ليست في الزواج وإنما هي في الوطء، والمقصود بها أن الزاني لا يطأ زانية أو مشركة،
 أي: لا يزني إلا بزانية أو مشركة، فالمراد بالنكاح هنا الوطء؛ لأن الله قال: «إِلَّا زَانٍ أَوْ مُشْرِكٌ» قالوا: فقد جاء ذ
كر المشرك، والمشرك لا يمكن بحال أن يعقد على مسلمة، فلا يجوز للمشرك أن يتزوج مسلمة ولا يجوز للمسلمة أن ينكحها مشرك، فقالو
ا: فالنكاح هنا يراد به الوطء، وعلى هذا فالزاني لا يطأ إلا زانية، يعني: فاجرة مثله، أو مشركة لا تعترف بحلال ولا حرام، وكذ
لك العكس: «وَالزَّانِيَةُ لا يَنكِحُهَا إِلَّا زَانٍ» مثلها «أَوْ مُشْرِكٌ» لا يفرق بين الحلال والحرام، ويستحل الزنا.

LINE 4
قالوا: فذكر المشرك هنا يدل على أن المراد به الوطء.

LINE 5
ولكن الحديث الذي أورده المصنف هنا في سبب نزول الآية وهو: أن الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم تلاها عليه وقال: [(لا تنكحها)] يدل
 على أن المقصود بذلك الزواج.

LINE 6
وقد تكلم شيخنا الشيخ محمد الأمين الشنقيطي رحمه الله تعالى على هذه الآية في (أضواء البيان) وقال: إن هذه من أصعب المسائل؛ 
لأن القرينة التي في الآية تدل على أن المراد بالنكاح الوطء، وسبب النزول يدل على أن المراد بالنكاح الزواج، قال: والتخلص -ي
عني: من هذا الإشكال- صعب ولا يتم إلا بنوع من التكلف والتعسف، ثم أشار إلى شيء من ذلك وقال: إن النكاح يحمل على أنه مشترك ف
ي المعنيين، فيطلق على الوطء وعلى النكاح، فيكون المراد به النكاح باعتبار والوطء باعتبار.

LINE 7
ومعنى ذلك أنه إن قصد به الوطء في الزنا فذلك لدلالة ذكر المشرك عليه، فيكون المراد به الوطء لقرينة ذكر المشرك، والحديث الذ
ي ورد بأن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم نهاه عن أن يتزوجها يدل على أن المراد بذلك الزواج، فتكون الآية تفسر بالمعنيين، فتحمل ع
لى المعنيين الذين يدل عليهما اللفظ بالاشتراك، وهما: الوطء والزواج.

LINE 8
والحاصل أن الزواج بالزانية من العفيف لا يجوز كما يدل عليه الحديث، وأما زواج الزاني بالزانية فإنه سائغ، لقوله صلى الله عل
يه وسلم: (لا ينكح الزاني المجلود إلا مثله) في الحديث الآتي، وقوله: (المجلود) يعني: أنه ظهر زناه وتحقق لوجود الجلد فيه، ف
الزاني الذي تحقق زناه لا ينكح إلا مثله.

LINE 9
فالذي يظهر أن العفيف لا يتزوج الفاجرة الزانية، وأما الزاني فإنه يتزوجها بدلاً من أن يشتغلا بالحرام.

LINE 10
وأما الحديث ففيه أن مرثد بن أبي مرثد الغنوي جاء إلى النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم، وكان يحمل الأسارى من مكة إلى المدينة، وكان
 هناك بغي بمكة يقال لها: عناق، وكانت صاحبته، فاستأذن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم في زواجها فتلا عليه الآية وقال له: [(لا تن
كحها)]، فيدل على أن العفيف لا يجوز له أن ينكح الزانية، وأن الزاني له أن ينكح الزانية التي تكون مثله، وأما المشرك فإنه لا
 يجوز له أن ينكح المسلمة مطلقاً لما جاء من نصوص الكتاب والسنة في ذلك.

LINE 11
والمراد بكون العفيف لا يتزوج الزانية هو قبل توبتها، وأما إذا تابت فالتوبة تجب ما قبلها، والله تعالى يتوب على من تاب، ولل
عفيف أن يتزوجها.
Resolving truncated output for line 3
It seems that line 3 got cut off due to the output limit, showing "..." that's not actually part of the content. To handle this, I’ll print the line in smaller slices and make sure I capture the full content. I’ll focus on line 3 specifically to get accurate results.

Managing truncated lines
It looks like line 12 is getting cut off by the output limit since it shows an ellipsis ("..."). I'll slice this line into smaller chunks to ensure I capture everything. This way, I can guarantee that I'm working with the full content for translation.

Investigating the ellipsis character
It seems like the "..." might be inserted into the string due to truncation while using the file search. I earlier didn't spot an ellipsis in the original text, but now the line has it. Could the ellipsis be a Unicode character, like "…", instead of three dots? I'll search the file for "…".

Searching for unicode ellipsis in text
# search for unicode ellipsis
import re
matches=[m.start() for m in re.finditer('…', txt)]
len(matches), matches[:10]

(0, [])
Checking for actual characters in the string
It seems the "..." in the string isn't the ellipsis character. It might have been inserted as a placeholder in my environment when printing. Since I assigned l=... and got '...', I'll check for '.' characters around it, and use repr to inspect the exact characters in the string.

Checking string representation and dot characters
repr(l)

"'هو جد شعيب، وهو عبد الله بن عمرو بن العاص رضي الله عنهما الصحابي الجليل، أحد العبادلة الأربعة من أصحاب النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم، وحديثه أخرجه أصحاب الكتب الستة.'"
Verifying the dots in the string
It looks like the three dots might just be regular periods, after all. But earlier my regex didn't find them. I ran the search on the original text, so it should have been caught. I’ll check if the dots are really periods or a similar-looking character, like ellipsis. I’ll inspect their Unicode values.

Checking for hidden characters in ellipsis
idx=l.find('...')
idx, [ord(c) for c in l[idx:idx+3]]

Identifying string truncation
Okay, it seems like the issue is related to string truncation. Repr displays "...", but that's not actually part of the string—it’s likely Jupyter truncating the output for large strings. I'll slice the string into smaller pieces and view the full content to make sure everything is there.

Crafting precise translation and handling details
Okay, now it’s time to craft the final translation, making sure there are no truncations. I need to ensure every segment is fully translated. For the Hadith reference, I’ll translate "al-zani al-majlud" as "the fornicator who has been flogged" and keep the parentheses intact. I'll also translate the bracketed section in P6705 accurately.

Reconstructing full chain Hadith translation
Alright, I’m going to fully reconstruct the chain Hadith in P6705, starting from line 2: "Ibrāhīm ibn Muḥammad al-Taymī narrated to us...". This narrative describes how Marthad ibn Abī Marthad al-Ghanawī used to carry captives in Makkah, and how he asked the Prophet if he could marry ʿAnāq, a prostitute who had been his friend.

Translating Hadith and verses accurately
The translation needs to be precise here. The Prophet ﷺ's response, when Marthad asked about marrying ʿAnāq, is recounted: He remained silent, then the verse "And the fornicatress is not married except by a fornicator or an idolater" was revealed (al-Nur 3), and he told Marthad not to marry her. We’ll translate the Arabic verse accurately without including Arabic script. Then, we’ll ensure other quoted parts are translated without Arabic, reflecting their meaning.

Clarifying terminology and translation approach
I need to mention terms like "waty'" and "nikah." Also, there are words like "takhallus" (escape) and "takalluf" (strain) to translate. For P6708, "ليس كفؤاً لها" will be translated as "not a suitable match for her." For P6711, "حق القسم" will be translated as "right to her turn." As for "isnād," I’ll use the transliteration with diacritics, since it's an acceptable term.

Adjusting transliteration for consistency
I'll avoid diacritics on non-name words like "hadith" and "nikah," as per ALA-LC guidelines. For narrator names, like "Ibrahim," I'll keep the diacritics. For titles like "Khalq Af'al al-Ibad," I will avoid diacritics and use apostrophes. I'll revise my previous translations to align with these rules.

Adjusting transliteration and formatting for consistency
I’m converting Arabic terms like "Ṣaḥīḥ" to "Sahih," and titles like "Adwa’ al-Bayan" will have no diacritics. In narration chains, names such as "ʿUbayd Allāh" will remain with the macron, but "Allah" will be plain. I’ll also make sure there are no Arabic numerals or specific formatting, and we’ll translate book titles when needed.

Translating and formatting hadith text
translation = """P6704 - Allah the Exalted’s statement: (The fornicator does not marry except a fornicatress or an idolatress)

P6705 - Explanation of the hadith of the Prophet ﷺ forbidding Marthad from marrying the prostitute ʿAnaq
The author, may Allah have mercy on him, said: [Chapter: Concerning Allah the Exalted’s statement: {The fornicator does not marry except a fornicatress} (al-Nur: 3).
Ibrāhīm ibn Muḥammad al-Taymī narrated to us; Yaḥyā narrated to us, from ʿUbayd Allāh ibn al-Akhnas, from ʿAmr ibn Shuʿayb, from his father, from his grandfather, may Allah be pleased with him, that Marthad ibn Abi Marthad al-Ghanawi used to carry captives in Makkah. In Makkah there was a prostitute called ʿAnaq, and she had been his friend. He said: (I came to the Prophet ﷺ and said: O Messenger of Allah! Shall I marry ʿAnaq? He remained silent toward me. Then it was revealed: {And the fornicatress is not married except by a fornicator or an idolater} (al-Nur: 3). Then he called me and recited it to me and said: Do not marry her.)].
Imam Abu Dawud al-Sijistani, may Allah have mercy on him, said: [Chapter: Concerning Allah the Exalted’s statement: {And the fornicatress is not married except by a fornicator or an idolater} (al-Nur: 3).]
This noble verse indicates that the fornicator does not marry except a fornicatress or an idolatress, and the fornicatress is not married except by a fornicator or an idolater. Abu Dawud mentioned this chapter heading and cited this hadith under it to make clear that marriage to a fornicatress is not permissible, due to the Prophet’s ﷺ prohibition of it.

P6706 - The ruling on marrying a fornicatress and the statements of the scholars concerning it
The scholars have differed regarding the ruling of marrying a fornicatress. Some of them said that it is permissible for a chaste man to marry a fornicatress, because she is among the slave-women of the Muslims and among the unmarried women about whom Allah the Exalted said: {Marry off the unmarried among you} (al-Nur: 32); so that includes fornicatresses and others besides fornicatresses.
Some of the people of knowledge said that the chaste man does not marry the fornicatress; rather, a fornicator like her marries her. In the hadith that comes after this there occurs: (A flogged fornicator does not marry except one like him). Its meaning, then, is that the chaste man does not marry the fornicatress, and that the fornicator may marry the fornicatress, because their occupying themselves with what is lawful is better than their occupying themselves with what is unlawful.
Among the scholars are those who said that this noble verse is not about marriage; rather, it is about intercourse. Its intent is that the fornicator does not have intercourse with a fornicatress or an idolatress—meaning, he does not commit fornication except with a fornicatress or an idolatress. So “nikah” here is meant as intercourse, because Allah said: “except a fornicator or an idolater.” They said: the idolater has been mentioned, and an idolater can in no case contract marriage to a Muslim woman; it is not permissible for an idolater to marry a Muslim woman, and it is not permissible for a Muslim woman to be married by an idolater. So they said: “nikah” here is meant as intercourse. On this basis, the fornicator does not have intercourse except with a fornicatress—meaning, an immoral woman like him—or an idolatress who does not acknowledge what is lawful or unlawful. Likewise, the reverse: “And the fornicatress is not ‘nikah-ed’ except by a fornicator” like her “or an idolater” who does not distinguish between lawful and unlawful and deems fornication permissible.
They said: so mentioning the idolater here indicates that what is meant is intercourse.
But the hadith the author cited here regarding the reason for the revelation of the verse—that the Messenger ﷺ recited it to him and said: (Do not marry her)—indicates that what is meant is marriage.
Our shaykh, Shaykh Muhammad al-Amin al-Shinqiti, may Allah have mercy on him, spoke about this verse in Adwa’ al-Bayan and said: this is among the most difficult issues, because the contextual indicator in the verse shows that what is meant by “nikah” is intercourse, while the reason for revelation shows that what is meant by “nikah” is marriage. He said: escaping—meaning, from this difficulty—is hard, and it is not achieved except with a kind of strain and contrivance. Then he pointed to something of that and said: “nikah” is taken as a shared word between the two meanings: it is used for intercourse and it is used for marriage; so what is meant is marriage in one respect and intercourse in another respect.
The meaning of that is that if what is intended by it is intercourse in fornication, that is due to the indication of mentioning the idolater; so what is intended is intercourse because of the contextual indicator of mentioning the idolater. And the hadith in which the Prophet ﷺ forbade him to marry her indicates that what is intended is marriage. Thus the verse is explained by both meanings and carried on both meanings that the wording indicates by shared usage: intercourse and marriage.
The upshot is that marriage to a fornicatress by a chaste man is not permissible, as the hadith indicates. As for the marriage of a fornicator to a fornicatress, it is allowable, due to his ﷺ statement: (A flogged fornicator does not marry except one like him) in the forthcoming hadith. His statement: “flogged” means that his fornication has become apparent and established by the presence of flogging for it; so the fornicator whose fornication has been established does not marry except one like him.
What appears is that the chaste man does not marry the immoral fornicatress; as for the fornicator, he marries her instead of the two of them occupying themselves with what is unlawful.
As for the hadith, it contains that Marthad ibn Abi Marthad al-Ghanawi came to the Prophet ﷺ, and he used to carry captives from Makkah to Madinah. There was in Makkah a prostitute called ʿAnaq, and she had been his companion. He sought the Prophet’s ﷺ permission to marry her, so he recited the verse to him and said to him: (Do not marry her). This indicates that it is not permissible for the chaste man to marry the fornicatress, and that the fornicator may marry the fornicatress who is like him. As for the idolater, it is not permissible for him to marry a Muslim woman at all, due to the texts of the Book and the Sunnah regarding that.
What is meant by the chaste man not marrying the fornicatress is before her repentance. As for when she repents, then repentance wipes out what came before it, and Allah the Exalted accepts repentance from whoever repents; and the chaste man may marry her.

P6707 - Biographies of the men in the chain of the hadith of the Prophet ﷺ forbidding Marthad from marrying the prostitute ʿAnaq
His statement: [Ibrāhīm ibn Muḥammad al-Taymī narrated to us.]
Ibrāhīm ibn Muḥammad al-Taymī is trustworthy; Abu Dawud and al-Nasa’i narrated from him.
[Yaḥyā narrated to us.]
He is Yaḥyā ibn Saʿīd al-Qaṭṭān, trustworthy; the authors of the Six Books narrated from him.
[From ʿUbayd Allāh ibn al-Akhnas.]
ʿUbayd Allāh ibn al-Akhnas is truthful; the authors of the Six Books narrated from him.
[From ʿAmr ibn Shuʿayb.]
He is ʿAmr ibn Shuʿayb ibn Muḥammad ibn ʿAbd Allāh ibn ʿAmr ibn al-ʿĀṣ, and he is truthful. Al-Bukhari narrated from him in (Juz’ al-Qira’ah) and the authors of the Sunan.
[From his father.]
He is Shuʿayb, and he is truthful. Al-Bukhari narrated from him in (Juz’ al-Qira’ah) and (al-Adab al-Mufrad), and the authors of the Sunan.
[From his grandfather.]
He is Shuʿayb’s grandfather, and he is ʿAbd Allāh ibn ʿAmr ibn al-ʿĀṣ, may Allah be pleased with them both, the noble Companion, one of the four Abd Allahs among the Companions of the Prophet ﷺ. The authors of the Six Books narrated his hadith.

P6708 - Explanation of the hadith: (A flogged fornicator does not marry except one like him)
The author, may Allah have mercy on him, said: [Musaddad and Abū Muʿammar said: ʿAbd al-Wārith narrated to us, from Ḥabīb—ʿAmr ibn Shuʿayb narrated to me—from Saʿīd al-Maqburī, from Abū Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, that he said: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: (A flogged fornicator does not marry except one like him).]
Abu Dawud cited the hadith of Abū Hurayrah: (A flogged fornicator does not marry except one like him). This indicates that the fornicator marries the fornicatress, and that is when both are not repentant. As for when they have repented, then repentance wipes out what came before it; the chaste man may marry the fornicatress if she repents, and likewise the reverse.
His statement: “flogged” means: the one upon whom the legal punishment has been carried out and whose fornication has been established. It has no contrary implication in the sense that the one who was not flogged would not be like that; rather, he is the same. The flogged and the non-flogged are equal in that regard. It only mentioned “flogged” because through it the existence of fornication is established. Flogging is an expiation for him; but if he does not repent, it is only an expiation for the sin that occurred from him. As for if he persists, then the flogging does not expiate his persistence, and he is not married to a chaste woman. However, if it happens that a fornicator has a marriage contract conducted for him with a chaste woman, then the contract is valid, and it is not said that the contract is invalid, even though he is not a suitable match for her.
As for the chaste man, many scholars permitted him to marry the fornicatress, using as evidence Allah the Exalted’s statement: {Marry off the unmarried among you} (al-Nur: 32).

P6709 - Biographies of the men in the chain of the hadith: (A flogged fornicator does not marry except one like him)
His statement: [He said: Musaddad narrated to us.]
He is Musaddad ibn Musarhad, trustworthy; al-Bukhari, Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi, and al-Nasa’i narrated from him.
[And Abū Muʿammar.]
He is ʿAbd Allāh ibn ʿAmr ibn Abī al-Ḥajjāj, trustworthy; the authors of the Six Books narrated from him.
[ʿAbd al-Wārith narrated to us.]
He is ʿAbd al-Wārith ibn Saʿīd al-ʿAnbarī, trustworthy; the authors of the Six Books narrated from him.
[From Ḥabīb.]
He is Ḥabīb al-Muʿallim, truthful; the authors of the Six Books narrated from him.
[From ʿAmr ibn Shuʿayb, from Saʿīd al-Maqburī.]
ʿAmr ibn Shuʿayb has already been mentioned, and Saʿīd al-Maqburī is trustworthy; the authors of the Six Books narrated from him.
[From Abū Hurayrah.]
He is ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ibn Ṣakhr al-Dawsī, the Companion of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, and the most prolific of his Companions in hadith without exception—may Allah be pleased with him and grant him pleasure.
[And Abū Muʿammar said: Ḥabīb al-Muʿallim narrated to me, from ʿAmr ibn Shuʿayb.]
Meaning: the wording he cited is upon the wording of the first shaykh, Musaddad, then he informed about the second shaykh. The narration from Abū Muʿammar came with the additional word “al-Muʿallim” appended to Ḥabīb; also, the first came with the wording “from,” whereas here it is with the wording of direct narration.

P6710 - A man frees his slave-girl, then marries her

P6711 - Explanation of the hadith: (Whoever frees his slave-girl, then marries her, has two rewards)
The author, may Allah have mercy on him, said: [Chapter: A man frees his slave-girl, then marries her.
Hannād ibn al-Sarī narrated to us; ʿAbthar narrated to us, from Muṭarrif, from ʿĀmir, from Abū Burdah, from Abū Mūsā, may Allah be pleased with him, that he said: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: (Whoever frees his slave-girl and marries her has two rewards).]
Abu Dawud cited this chapter heading—[Chapter: A man frees his slave-girl and marries her]—meaning: that this is valid and that it contains tremendous reward. That is because the Prophet ﷺ said, as in the hadith of Abū Mūsā: (He has two rewards), meaning: a reward for emancipating her and a reward for his kindness to her through emancipation and marriage. He married her, and she came to have a right to an allotted turn after previously having no allotted turn; he treated her well by transferring her from a state in which she had no allotted turn to a state in which she is among the wives who receive allotted turns. Thus he has two rewards: a reward for emancipating her and treating her well through emancipation, and a reward for treating her well through marriage, and for her becoming among his wives who have a right to an allotted turn.

P6712 - Biographies of the men in the chain of the hadith: (Whoever frees his slave-girl, then marries her, has two rewards)
His statement: [Hannād ibn al-Sarī narrated to us.]
He is Hannād ibn al-Sarī, Abū al-Sarī, trustworthy. Al-Bukhari narrated his hadith in (Khalq Af‘al al-‘Ibad), and Muslim and the authors of the Sunan.
[ʿAbthar narrated to us.]
ʿAbthar is trustworthy; the authors of the Six Books narrated from him.
[From Muṭarrif.]
He is Muṭarrif ibn Ṭarīf, trustworthy; the authors of the Six Books narrated from him.
[From ʿĀmir.]
He is ʿĀmir ibn Sharāḥīl al-Shaʿbī, trustworthy; the authors of the Six Books narrated from him.
[From Abū Burdah.]
He is Abū Burdah ibn Abū Mūsā al-Ashʿarī, trustworthy; the authors of the Six Books narrated from him.
[From Abū Mūsā.]
He is Abū Mūsā al-Ashʿarī, ʿAbd Allāh ibn Qays, may Allah be pleased with him. The authors of the Six Books narrated his hadith. Thus, all the men of this chain are narrated from by the authors of the Six Books except for Hannād: al-Bukhari did not narrate from him in the Sahih; rather, he narrated from him in (Khalq Af‘al al-‘Ibad).

P6713 - Explanation of the hadith of the Prophet ﷺ emancipating Safiyyah and making her emancipation her dower
The author, may Allah have mercy on him, said: [ʿAmr ibn ʿAwn narrated to us; Abū ʿAwānah informed us, from Qatādah and ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz ibn Ṣuhayb, from Anas ibn Mālik, may Allah be pleased with him: (that the Prophet ﷺ emancipated Safiyyah, may Allah be pleased with her, and made her emancipation her dower).]
Abu Dawud cited the hadith of Anas ibn Malik, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Prophet ﷺ married Safiyyah and made her emancipation her dower. Safiyyah is the daughter of Huyayy ibn Akhtab, may Allah be pleased with her, the Mother of the Believers. She had been a slave-girl, so he emancipated her, and the Prophet ﷺ made her emancipation her dower. This indicates what the author wrote the chapter heading for: emancipation and marriage, and that by doing so he has shown two kinds of kindness, and that it is permissible to make emancipation a dower, because it is a blessing he bestowed upon her. The scholars have differed regarding whether this is specific to the Messenger ﷺ or whether it is for him and others besides him. Saying that it is specific requires evidence; the correct view is that it is allowable and permissible, and that it is not among the special characteristics of the Messenger ﷺ.
His statement: (He emancipated Safiyyah and made her emancipation her dower) means: he emancipated her and married her, and her emancipation is her dower.

P6714 - Biographies of the men in the chain of the hadith of the Prophet ﷺ emancipating Safiyyah and making her emancipation her dower
His statement: [ʿAmr ibn ʿAwn narrated to us.]
ʿAmr ibn ʿAwn is trustworthy; the authors of the Six Books narrated from him.
[Abū ʿAwānah informed us.]
He is al-Waḍḍāḥ ibn ʿAbd Allāh al-Yashkurī; he is trustworthy; the authors of the Six Books narrated from him.
[From Qatādah.]
He is Qatādah ibn Diʿāmah al-Sadūsī al-Baṣrī; he is trustworthy; the authors of the Six Books narrated from him.
[And ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz ibn Ṣuhayb.]
ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz ibn Ṣuhayb is trustworthy; the authors of the Six Books narrated from him.
[From Anas ibn Mālik.]
He is Anas ibn Mālik, may Allah be pleased with him, the Companion of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and his servant, and one of the seven known for abundant narration from the Prophet ﷺ.
This chain is four-link, for Qatādah and ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz are in one rank; thus it is a four-link chain, and it is among the highest chains with Abu Dawud.

P6715 - Explanation of Sunan Abu Dawud [237]
The Sacred Law has made clear that what becomes unlawful due to suckling is the same as what becomes unlawful due to lineage, and that the rulings of suckling are like the rulings of lineage: the wet-nurse becomes a mother to the suckling child, her husband—who is the owner of the milk—becomes a father to the child, her children become siblings to the child, and in this manner the prohibition of marriage spreads through ascendants and descendants.

Removing truncations and adjusting diacritics
I need to remove the ellipsis ("...") I’d inserted for cell output limits, as I should provide the full translation. Regarding diacritics, it’s fine for book titles like "Khalq Af‘al al-‘Ibad," but I’ll switch to straight apostrophes for consistency. Also, I should avoid using ALA-LC transliteration for the name "ʿAnaq," since it isn't part of the narration chain.

Correcting diacritics for non-narrator names
I need to remove diacritics from names like "Anaq" and "Marthad" because they aren't part of the narrator chain, and only narrator names should have diacritics. For example, "ʿAnaq" should become "Anaq," even though "ʿ" is technically part of ALA-LC. If the names aren’t in the chain or narration, they shouldn't have diacritics.

Correcting diacritics and placeholders
In P6705, the name "Marthad ibn Abi Marthad al-Ghanawi" is part of the matn, not the chain, so it should appear plain with no diacritics. Similarly, "ʿAnaq" should be updated to "Anaq" everywhere unless it’s part of the chain. Also, reference placeholders like "..." should be replaced with full sentences or translations from Arabic. I'll ensure these updates are made.

Updating P6705 and P6706 translations
In P6705, I'll replace the ellipsis with the full translation of the verse from al-Nur (3) and the subsequent call to action: "Do not marry her." In P6706, I’ll add the missing part after "woman" and ensure the rest of the context is included for clarity and completeness. I'll revise accordingly.

Fixing truncations and adjustments for translations
In P6705, I'll update where truncations occurred in Shinqiti's reconciliation, and ensure all relevant parts are fully translated. Similarly, for P6708, I’ll fill in the missing translation for flogging as expiation and address the contract issue with a fornicator. I'll ensure full translations for commentary in P6711 and P6713, and adjust apostrophes for proper names.

Finalizing transliteration consistency
To simplify, I'll maintain diacritics only for narrators in the chain (like "Ibrāhīm," "ʿĀmir," and "Abu Mūsā"). For names not in the chain (like "Abu Dawud"), we’ll keep them plain without diacritics. This will apply consistently, even outside the chain, before I complete the final translation without ellipses.

Ibrāhīm ibn Muḥammad al-Taymī narrated to us; Yaḥyā narrated to us, from ʿUbayd Allāh ibn al-Akhnas, from ʿAmr ibn Shuʿayb, from his father, from his grandfather, may Allah be pleased with him, that Marthad ibn Abi Marthad al-Ghanawi used to carry captives in Makkah. In Makkah there was a prostitute called Anaq, and she had been his companion. He said: (I came to the Prophet ﷺ and said: O Messenger of Allah! Shall I marry Anaq? He remained silent toward me. Then it was revealed: {And the fornicatress is not married except by a fornicator or an idolater} (al-Nur: 3). Then he called me, recited it to me, and said: Do not marry her.)].
Imam Abu Dawud al-Sijistani, may Allah have mercy on him, said: [Chapter: Concerning Allah the Exalted’s statement: {And the fornicatress is not married except by a fornicator or an idolater} (al-Nur: 3).]
This noble verse indicates that the fornicator does not marry except a fornicatress or an idolatress, and the fornicatress is not married except by a fornicator or an idolater. Abu Dawud mentioned this chapter heading and cited this hadith under it to make clear that marriage to a fornicatress is not permissible, due to the Prophet’s ﷺ prohibition of it.

P6706 - The ruling on marrying a fornicatress and the statements of the scholars concerning it
The scholars have differed regarding the ruling of marrying a fornicatress. Some of them said that it is permissible for a chaste man to marry a fornicatress, because she is among the slave-women of the Muslims and among the unmarried women about whom Allah the Exalted said: {Marry off the unmarried among you} (al-Nur: 32); so that includes fornicatresses and others besides fornicatresses.
Some of the people of knowledge said that the chaste man does not marry the fornicatress; rather, a fornicator like her marries her. In the hadith that comes after this there occurs: (A flogged fornicator does not marry except one like him). Its meaning, then, is that the chaste man does not marry the fornicatress, and that the fornicator may marry the fornicatress, because their occupying themselves with what is lawful is better than their occupying themselves with what is unlawful.
Among the scholars are those who said that this noble verse is not about marriage; rather, it is about intercourse. Its intent is that the fornicator does not have intercourse with a fornicatress or an idolatress—meaning, he does not commit fornication except with a fornicatress or an idolatress. So “nikah” here is meant as intercourse, because Allah said: “except a fornicator or an idolater.” They said: the idolater has been mentioned, and an idolater can in no case contract marriage to a Muslim woman; thus it is not permissible for an idolater to marry a Muslim woman, and it is not permissible for a Muslim woman to be married by an idolater. So they said: “nikah” here is intended as intercourse. On this basis, the fornicator does not have intercourse except with a fornicatress—meaning, one immoral like him—or with an idolatress who does not acknowledge what is lawful and unlawful. Likewise the reverse: “And the fornicatress is not married except by a fornicator”—one like her—“or an idolater,” who does not distinguish between what is lawful and unlawful and considers fornication permissible.
They said: so mentioning the idolater here indicates that what is meant is intercourse.
But the hadith the author cited here regarding the reason for the revelation of the verse—that the Messenger ﷺ recited it to him and said: (Do not marry her)—indicates that what is meant is marriage.
Our shaykh, Shaykh Muhammad al-Amin al-Shinqiti, may Allah have mercy on him, spoke about this verse in (Adwa’ al-Bayan) and said: this is among the most difficult issues, because the contextual indicator in the verse shows that what is meant by “nikah” is intercourse, while the reason for revelation shows that what is meant by “nikah” is marriage. He said: escaping—meaning, from this difficulty—is hard and is not achieved except with a kind of strain and contrivance. Then he pointed to something of that and said: “nikah” is taken as a word shared between the two meanings: it is used for intercourse and it is used for marriage. Thus what is meant is marriage in one respect and intercourse in another respect.
The meaning of that is that if what is intended by it is intercourse in fornication, that is due to the indication of mentioning the idolater; so what is intended is intercourse because of the contextual indicator of mentioning the idolater. And the hadith in which the Prophet ﷺ forbade him to marry her indicates that what is intended is marriage. Thus the verse is explained by both meanings and carried on both meanings that the wording indicates by shared usage: intercourse and marriage.
The upshot is that marriage to a fornicatress by a chaste man is not permissible, as the hadith indicates. As for the marriage of a fornicator to a fornicatress, it is allowable, due to his ﷺ statement: (A flogged fornicator does not marry except one like him) in the forthcoming hadith. His statement: “flogged” means that his fornication has become apparent and established by the presence of flogging for it; so the fornicator whose fornication has been established does not marry except one like him.
What appears is that the chaste man does not marry the immoral fornicatress; as for the fornicator, he marries her instead of the two of them occupying themselves with what is unlawful.
As for the hadith, it contains that Marthad ibn Abi Marthad al-Ghanawi came to the Prophet ﷺ, and he used to carry captives from Makkah to Madinah. There was in Makkah a prostitute called Anaq, and she had been his companion. He sought the Prophet’s ﷺ permission to marry her, so he recited the verse to him and said to him: (Do not marry her). This indicates that it is not permissible for the chaste man to marry the fornicatress, and that the fornicator may marry the fornicatress who is like him. As for the idolater, it is not permissible for him to marry a Muslim woman at all, due to what has come in the texts of the Book and the Sunnah concerning that.
What is meant by the chaste man not marrying the fornicatress is before her repentance. As for when she repents, then repentance wipes out what came before it, and Allah the Exalted accepts repentance from whoever repents; and the chaste man may marry her.

His statement: [Ibrāhīm ibn Muḥammad al-Taymī narrated to us.]
Ibrāhīm ibn Muḥammad al-Taymī is trustworthy; Abu Dawud and al-Nasa'i narrated from him.
[Yaḥyā narrated to us.]
He is Yaḥyā ibn Saʿīd al-Qaṭṭān, trustworthy; the authors of the Six Books narrated from him.
[From ʿUbayd Allāh ibn al-Akhnas.]

[From ʿAmr ibn Shuʿayb.]
He is ʿAmr ibn Shuʿayb ibn Muḥammad ibn ʿAbd Allāh ibn ʿAmr ibn al-ʿĀṣ, and he is truthful. Al-Bukhari narrated from him in (Juz' al-Qira'ah), and the authors of the Sunan.
[From his father.]
He is Shuʿayb, and he is truthful. Al-Bukhari narrated from him in (Juz' al-Qira'ah) and (al-Adab al-Mufrad), and the authors of the Sunan.
[From his grandfather.]
He is Shuʿayb’s grandfather, and he is ʿAbd Allāh ibn ʿAmr ibn al-ʿĀṣ, may Allah be pleased with them both, the noble Companion, one of the four Abd Allahs among the Companions of the Prophet ﷺ. The authors of the Six Books narrated his hadith.

P6708 - Explanation of the hadith: (A flogged fornicator does not marry except one like him)
The author, may Allah have mercy on him, said: [Musaddad and Abū Muʿammar said: ʿAbd al-Wārith narrated to us, from Ḥabīb, who narrated to me: ʿAmr ibn Shuʿayb, from Saʿīd al-Maqburī, from Abū Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, that he said: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: (A flogged fornicator does not marry except one like him).]
Abu Dawud cited the hadith of Abū Hurayrah: (A flogged fornicator does not marry except one like him). This indicates that the fornicator marries the fornicatress, and that is when both are not repentant. As for when they have repented, then repentance wipes out what came before it; the chaste man may marry the fornicatress if she repents, and likewise the reverse.
His statement: “flogged” means: the one upon whom the legal punishment has been carried out and whose fornication has been established. It has no contrary implication in the sense that the one who was not flogged would not be like that; rather, he is the same. The flogged and the non-flogged are equal in that regard, but it mentioned “flogged” because through it the existence of fornication is established. Flogging is an expiation for him; but if he does not repent, it is an expiation for the sin that occurred from him only. As for if he persists, then the flogging does not expiate his persistence, and he is not married to a chaste woman. However, if it happens that a fornicator is contracted in marriage to a chaste woman, the contract is valid and it is not said that the contract is void, even if he is not a suitable match for her.
As for the chaste man, many scholars permitted him to marry the fornicatress, using as evidence Allah the Exalted’s statement: {Marry off the unmarried among you} (al-Nur: 32).

He is ʿAbd al-Wārith ibn Saʿīd al-ʿAnbarī, and he is trustworthy; the authors of the Six Books narrated from him.
[From Ḥabīb.]
He is Ḥabīb al-Muʿallim, and he is truthful; the authors of the Six Books narrated from him.
[From ʿAmr ibn Shuʿayb, from Saʿīd al-Maqburī.]

[And Abū Muʿammar said: Ḥabīb al-Muʿallim narrated to me, from ʿAmr ibn Shuʿayb.]
Meaning: the wording he cited is upon the wording of the first shaykh, Musaddad; then he informed about the second shaykh. The narration from Abū Muʿammar came with the additional word “al-Muʿallim” appended to Ḥabīb; also, the first was with the wording “from,” while here it is with the wording of direct narration.

P6710 - A man frees his slave-girl, then marries her

P6711 - Explanation of the hadith: (Whoever frees his slave-girl, then marries her, has two rewards)
The author, may Allah have mercy on him, said: [Chapter: A man frees his slave-girl, then marries her.
Hannād ibn al-Sarī narrated to us; ʿAbthar narrated to us, from Muṭarrif, from ʿĀmir, from Abū Burdah, from Abū Mūsā, may Allah be pleased with him, that he said: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: (Whoever frees his slave-girl and marries her has two rewards).]
Abu Dawud cited this chapter heading—[Chapter: A man frees his slave-girl and marries her]—meaning: that this is valid and that it contains tremendous reward. That is because the Prophet ﷺ said, as in the hadith of Abū Mūsā: (He has two rewards), meaning: a reward for emancipating her and a reward for his kindness to her through emancipation and marriage. He married her, and she came to have a right to an allotted turn after previously having no allotted turn. Thus he treated her well by transferring her from the state of having no allotted turn to the state of being among the wives for whom turns are allotted. So he has two rewards: a reward for emancipating her and being kind to her through emancipation, and a reward for being kind to her through marriage, and for her becoming among his wives who have the right to an allotted turn.

P6712 - Biographies of the men in the chain of the hadith: (Whoever frees his slave-girl, then marries her, has two rewards)
His statement: [Hannād ibn al-Sarī narrated to us.]
He is Hannād ibn al-Sarī, Abū al-Sarī, and he is trustworthy. Al-Bukhari narrated his hadith in (Khalq Af'al al-'Ibad), and Muslim and the authors of the Sunan.
[ʿAbthar narrated to us.]
ʿAbthar is trustworthy; the authors of the Six Books narrated from him.

He is Muṭarrif ibn Ṭarīf, and he is trustworthy; the authors of the Six Books narrated from him.
[From ʿĀmir.]
He is ʿĀmir ibn Sharāḥīl al-Shaʿbī, and he is trustworthy; the authors of the Six Books narrated from him.
[From Abū Burdah.]
He is Abū Burdah ibn Abī Mūsā al-Ashʿarī, and he is trustworthy; the authors of the Six Books narrated from him.
[From Abū Mūsā.]
He is Abū Mūsā al-Ashʿarī, ʿAbd Allāh ibn Qays, may Allah be pleased with him, and the authors of the Six Books narrated his hadith. Thus, all the men of this chain are narrated from by the authors of the Six Books except for Hannād: al-Bukhari did not narrate from him in the Sahih; rather, he narrated from him in (Khalq Af'al al-'Ibad).

P6713 - Explanation of the hadith of the Prophet ﷺ emancipating Safiyyah and making her emancipation her dower
The author, may Allah have mercy on him, said: [ʿAmr ibn ʿAwn narrated to us; Abū ʿAwānah informed us, from Qatādah and ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz ibn Ṣuhayb, from Anas ibn Mālik, may Allah be pleased with him: (that the Prophet ﷺ emancipated Safiyyah, may Allah be pleased with her, and made her emancipation her dower).]
Abu Dawud cited the hadith of Anas ibn Malik, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Prophet ﷺ married Safiyyah and made her emancipation her dower. Safiyyah is the daughter of Huyayy ibn Akhtab, may Allah be pleased with her, the Mother of the Believers. She had been a slave-girl, so he emancipated her, and the Prophet ﷺ made her emancipation her dower. This indicates what the author wrote the chapter heading for: emancipation and marriage, and that by doing so he has shown two kinds of kindness. It also indicates that it is permissible to make emancipation a dower, because it is a blessing he bestowed upon her. The scholars have differed over whether this is specific to the Messenger ﷺ or whether it is for him and others. Saying that it is a special characteristic requires evidence; the correct view is that it is permissible and allowable, and that it is not among the special characteristics of the Messenger ﷺ.
His statement: (He emancipated Safiyyah and made her emancipation her dower) means: he emancipated her and married her, and her emancipation is her dower.

P6714 - Biographies of the men in the chain of the hadith of the Prophet ﷺ emancipating Safiyyah and making her emancipation her dower
His statement: [ʿAmr ibn ʿAwn narrated to us.]
ʿAmr ibn ʿAwn is trustworthy; the authors of the Six Books narrated from him.
[Abū ʿAwānah informed us.]
He is al-Waḍḍāḥ ibn ʿAbd Allāh al-Yashkurī; he is trustworthy; the authors of the Six Books narrated from him.
[From Qatādah.]
He is Qatādah ibn Diʿāmah al-Sadūsī al-Baṣrī, and he is trustworthy; the authors of the Six Books narrated from him.
[And ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz ibn Ṣuhayb.]
ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz ibn Ṣuhayb is trustworthy; the authors of the Six Books narrated from him.
[From Anas ibn Mālik.]
He is Anas ibn Mālik, may Allah be pleased with him, the Companion of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and his servant, and one of the seven known for abundant narration from the Prophet ﷺ.
This chain is four-narrator, for Qatādah and ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz are in one rank; thus it is a four-narrator chain, and it is among the highest chains with Abu Dawud.

P6715 - Explanation of Sunan Abu Dawud [237]
The Sacred Law has made clear that what becomes unlawful due to suckling is the same as what becomes unlawful due to lineage, and that the rulings of suckling are like the rulings of lineage: the wet-nurse becomes a mother to the suckling child, her husband—who is the owner of the milk—becomes a father to the suckling child, her children become siblings to the suckling child, and in this manner the prohibition of marriage spreads through ascendants and descendants.

P6705 - Explanation of the hadith of the Prophet ﷺ forbidding Marthad from marrying the prostitute Anaq
The author, may Allah have mercy on him, said: [Chapter: Concerning Allah the Exalted’s statement: {The fornicator does not marry except a fornicatress} (al-Nur: 3).
Ibrāhīm ibn Muḥammad al-Taymī narrated to us; Yaḥyā narrated to us, from ʿUbayd Allāh ibn al-Akhnas, from ʿAmr ibn Shuʿayb, from his father, from his grandfather, may Allah be pleased with him, that Marthad ibn Abi Marthad al-Ghanawi used to carry captives in Makkah. In Makkah there was a prostitute called Anaq, and she had been his companion. He said: (I came to the Prophet ﷺ and said: O Messenger of Allah! Shall I marry Anaq? He remained silent toward me. Then it was revealed: {And the fornicatress is not married except by a fornicator or an idolater} (al-Nur: 3). Then he called me, recited it to me, and said: Do not marry her.)]
Imam Abu Dawud al-Sijistani, may Allah have mercy on him, said: [Chapter: Concerning Allah the Exalted’s statement: {And the fornicatress is not married except by a fornicator or an idolater} (al-Nur: 3).]
This noble verse indicates that the fornicator does not marry except a fornicatress or an idolatress, and the fornicatress is not married except by a fornicator or an idolater. Abu Dawud mentioned this chapter heading and cited this hadith under it to make clear that marriage to a fornicatress is not permissible, due to the Prophet’s ﷺ prohibition of it.

P6706 - The ruling on marrying a fornicatress and the statements of the scholars concerning it
The scholars have differed regarding the ruling of marrying a fornicatress. Some of them said that it is permissible for a chaste man to marry a fornicatress, because she is among the slave-women of the Muslims and among the unmarried women about whom Allah the Exalted said: {Marry off the unmarried among you} (al-Nur: 32); so that includes fornicatresses and others besides fornicatresses.
Some of the people of knowledge said that the chaste man does not marry the fornicatress; rather, a fornicator like her marries her. In the hadith that comes after this there occurs: (A flogged fornicator does not marry except one like him). Its meaning, then, is that the chaste man does not marry the fornicatress, and that the fornicator may marry the fornicatress, because their occupying themselves with what is lawful is better than their occupying themselves with what is unlawful.
Among the scholars are those who said that this noble verse is not about marriage; rather, it is about intercourse. Its intent is that the fornicator does not have intercourse with a fornicatress or an idolatress—meaning, he does not commit fornication except with a fornicatress or an idolatress. So “nikah” here is meant as intercourse, because Allah said: “except a fornicator or an idolater.” They said: the idolater has been mentioned, and an idolater can in no case contract marriage to a Muslim woman; so it is not permissible for an idolater to marry a Muslim woman, nor is it permissible for a Muslim woman to be married by an idolater. So they said: “nikah” here is intended as intercourse. On that basis, the fornicator does not have intercourse except with a fornicatress—meaning, an immoral woman like him—or with an idolatress who does not acknowledge what is lawful or unlawful. Likewise, the reverse: “And the fornicatress is not married except by a fornicator,” one like her, “or an idolater,” who does not distinguish between the lawful and the unlawful and deems fornication permissible.
They said: so mentioning the idolater here indicates that what is meant is intercourse.
But the hadith the author cited here regarding the reason for the revelation of the verse—that the Messenger ﷺ recited it to him and said: (Do not marry her)—indicates that what is meant is marriage.
Our shaykh, Shaykh Muhammad al-Amin al-Shinqiti, may Allah have mercy on him, spoke about this verse in (Adwa’ al-Bayan) and said: this is among the most difficult issues, because the contextual indicator in the verse shows that what is meant by “nikah” is intercourse, while the reason for revelation shows that what is meant by “nikah” is marriage. He said: escaping—meaning, from this difficulty—is hard and is not achieved except with a kind of strain and contrivance. Then he pointed to something of that and said: “nikah” is taken as a shared term for the two meanings: it is used for intercourse and it is used for marriage; so what is intended by it is marriage in one respect and intercourse in another respect.
The meaning of that is that if what is intended by it is intercourse in fornication, that is due to the indication of mentioning the idolater; so what is intended is intercourse because of the contextual indicator of mentioning the idolater. And the hadith in which the Prophet ﷺ forbade him to marry her indicates that what is intended is marriage. Thus the verse is explained by both meanings and carried on both meanings that the wording indicates by shared usage: intercourse and marriage.
The upshot is that marriage to a fornicatress by a chaste man is not permissible, as the hadith indicates. As for the marriage of a fornicator to a fornicatress, it is allowable, due to his ﷺ statement: (A flogged fornicator does not marry except one like him) in the forthcoming hadith.

As for the idolater, it is not permissible for him to marry a Muslim woman at all, due to the texts of the Book and the Sunnah that have come concerning that.
What is meant by the chaste man not marrying the fornicatress is before her repentance. As for when she repents, then repentance wipes out what came before it, and Allah the Exalted accepts repentance from whoever repents; and the chaste man may marry her.

P6708 - Explanation of the hadith: (A flogged fornicator does not marry except one like him)
The author, may Allah have mercy on him, said: [Musaddad and Abū Muʿammar said: ʿAbd al-Wārith narrated to us, from Ḥabīb; ʿAmr ibn Shuʿayb narrated to me, from Saʿīd al-Maqburī, from Abū Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, that he said: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: (A flogged fornicator does not marry except one like him).]
Abu Dawud cited the hadith of Abū Hurayrah: (A flogged fornicator does not marry except one like him). This indicates that the fornicator marries the fornicatress, and that is when both are not repentant. As for when they have repented, then repentance wipes out what came before it; the chaste man may marry the fornicatress if she repents, and likewise the reverse.
His statement: “flogged” means: the one upon whom the legal punishment has been carried out and whose fornication has been established. It has no contrary implication in the sense that the one who was not flogged would not be like that; rather, he is the same. The flogged and the non-flogged are equal in that regard; it mentioned “flogged” because through it the existence of fornication is established. Flogging is an expiation for him; but if he does not repent, it is an expiation for the sin that occurred from him only. As for if he persists, the flogging does not expiate his persistence, and he is not married to a chaste woman. However, if it happens that a fornicator has a marriage contract concluded for him with a chaste woman, then the contract is valid, and it is not said: the contract is void, even if he is not a suitable match for her.
As for the chaste man, many scholars permitted him to marry the fornicatress, using as evidence Allah the Exalted’s statement: {Marry off the unmarried among you} (al-Nur: 32).

Hannād ibn al-Sarī narrated to us; ʿAbthar narrated to us, from Muṭarrif, from ʿĀmir, from Abū Burdah, from Abū Mūsā, may Allah be pleased with him, that he said: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: (Whoever frees his slave-girl and marries her has two rewards).]
Abu Dawud cited this chapter heading—[Chapter: A man frees his slave-girl and marries her]—meaning: that this is valid and that it contains tremendous reward. That is because the Prophet ﷺ said, as in the hadith of Abū Mūsā: (He has two rewards), meaning: a reward for emancipating her and a reward for his kindness to her through emancipation and marriage. He married her, and she came to have a right to an allotted turn after previously having no allotted turn. Thus he treated her well by transferring her from a state in which she had no allotted turn to a state in which she was among the wives who are allotted turns. Therefore he has two rewards: a reward for emancipating her and treating her well by emancipation, and a reward for treating her well by marriage and for her becoming among his wives who have the right to an allotted turn.

P6712 - Biographies of the men in the chain of the hadith: (Whoever frees his slave-girl, then marries her, has two rewards)
His statement: [Hannād ibn al-Sarī narrated to us.]
He is Hannād ibn al-Sarī, Abū al-Sarī, and he is trustworthy. Al-Bukhari narrated his hadith in (Khalq Af'al al-'Ibad), and Muslim and the authors of the Sunan.
[ʿAbthar narrated to us.]
ʿAbthar is trustworthy; the authors of the Six Books narrated from him.
[From Muṭarrif.]
He is Muṭarrif ibn Ṭarīf, and he is trustworthy; the authors of the Six Books narrated from him.
[From ʿĀmir.]
He is ʿĀmir ibn Sharāḥīl al-Shaʿbī, and he is trustworthy; the authors of the Six Books narrated from him.

He is Abū Burdah ibn Abī Mūsā al-Ashʿarī, and he is trustworthy; the authors of the Six Books narrated from him.
[From Abū Mūsā.]
He is Abū Mūsā al-Ashʿarī, ʿAbd Allāh ibn Qays, may Allah be pleased with him, and the authors of the Six Books narrated his hadith. Thus, all the men of this chain are narrated from by the authors of the Six Books except for Hannād: al-Bukhari did not narrate from him in the Sahih; rather, he narrated from him in (Khalq Af'al al-'Ibad).

P6713 - Explanation of the hadith of the Prophet ﷺ emancipating Safiyyah and making her emancipation her dower
The author, may Allah have mercy on him, said: [ʿAmr ibn ʿAwn narrated to us; Abū ʿAwānah informed us, from Qatādah and ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz ibn Ṣuhayb, from Anas ibn Mālik, may Allah be pleased with him: (that the Prophet ﷺ emancipated Safiyyah, may Allah be pleased with her, and made her emancipation her dower).]
Abu Dawud cited the hadith of Anas ibn Malik, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Prophet ﷺ married Safiyyah and made her emancipation her dower. Safiyyah is the daughter of Huyayy ibn Akhtab, may Allah be pleased with her, the Mother of the Believers. She had been a slave-girl, so he emancipated her, and the Prophet ﷺ made her emancipation her dower. This indicates what the author wrote the chapter heading for regarding emancipation and marriage: that by doing so he has shown two kindnesses, and that it is permissible to make emancipation a dower, because it is a blessing he bestowed upon her. The scholars have differed regarding whether this is specific to the Messenger ﷺ or whether it is for him and others; saying that it is a special characteristic requires evidence, so the correct view is that it is allowable and permissible, and that it is not among the special characteristics of the Messenger ﷺ.
His statement: (He emancipated Safiyyah and made her emancipation her dower) means: he emancipated her and married her, and her emancipation is her dower.

P6714 - Biographies of the men in the chain of the hadith of the Prophet ﷺ emancipating Safiyyah and making her emancipation her dower

[And ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz ibn Ṣuhayb.]
ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz ibn Ṣuhayb is trustworthy; the authors of the Six Books narrated from him.
[From Anas ibn Mālik.]
He is Anas ibn Mālik, may Allah be pleased with him, the Companion of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and his servant, and one of the seven known for abundant narration from the Prophet ﷺ.
This chain is four-narrator: Qatādah and ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz are in one rank, so it is a four-narrator chain, and it is among the highest chains with Abu Dawud.

P6715 - Explanation of Sunan Abu Dawud [237]
The Sacred Law has made clear that what becomes unlawful due to suckling is the same as what becomes unlawful due to lineage, and that the rulings of suckling are like the rulings of lineage: the wet-nurse becomes a mother to the suckling child, her husband—who is the owner of the milk—becomes a father to the suckling child, her children become siblings to the suckling child, and in this manner the prohibition of marriage spreads through ascendants and descendants.

Alright, I just need to check for the trailing "is ..." and make sure there are no incomplete phrases left. It seems I might’ve used the three dots by accident.

It seems like the truncation is happening in the environment, not within the translation string itself. I’ll double-check by examining the length and slicing in known segments.

Okay, it’s complete. But there are other parts where I might have unintentionally included "..." in previous drafts.

Inspecting incomplete truncations
In the latest translation, there seem to be places like "tha..." where I might have unintentionally truncated things during writing.

It looks like the output's still being truncated, probably because the content is lengthy. I'll handle this by targeting specific indices for the start and end of the paragraph.

The scholars have differed regarding whether this is specific to the Messenger ﷺ or whether it is for him and others; saying that it is a special characteristic requires evidence, so the correct view is that it is allowable and permissible, and that it is not among the special characteristics of the Messenger ﷺ.

Okay, the output is still being truncated, but it seems like the full substring is there despite the limitation. I'm thinking about how to get around this issue—maybe I can adjust the range for the text to ensure I capture the full content while avoiding the cut-off.

Investigating output truncation
It seems like Jupyter is truncating output, replacing parts of the string with "..." even within a 200-character chunk. This might be because the string contains non-ASCII characters or newlines. I’ll check whether the translation string genuinely has "..." or if’s just the interface showing truncation due to line breaks.

It looks like the "reg..." display is just truncation in the interface and not an issue with the translation itself. However, I did intently truncate some parts of sentences, like “As for t...”. I’ll check if I missed any content by searching for "As for t" or similar patterns with line breaks.

Checking for incomplete placeholders
It seems that there are still parts in the text where I used "..." as placeholders, like in the sentence about an idolater marrying a Muslim woman. I’ll verify if this is part of the translation, and check the full context surrounding "Muslim woman;" to ensure no piece is missing and produce a more complete translation.

Rewriting incomplete translations
It looks like I need to address several incomplete translations where I used ellipses ("..."). I'm missing parts of the translation for certain paragraphs, such as those about idolater marriage, Shinqiti, and the hadith of Marthad. I’ll make sure to start again and use the full, accurate Arabic lines to provide the complete and correct translation.

Including full translation details
I’ll need to ensure that the translation of P6705 contains both the author's and Imam Abu Dawud’s statements, as the Arabic provides separate headings. For the translation of P6706, I need to include all the details and translate quoted Arabic in a way that makes sense in English, ensuring accuracy. I’ll start by double-checking these phrases and translating exactly.

Clarifying translation intent
The intent behind the statement is that fornication is only permissible between a fornicator and another fornicator, or between an idolater and an idolater. Since an idolater cannot marry a Muslim woman, "nikah" here refers to intercourse rather than marriage. The emphasis is on the shared immorality of these individuals.

Fine-tuning translation details
I’m ensuring I translate carefully and not too interpretively. The reverse situation—where a fornicatress can only marry a fornicator or an idolater—is important to note. I’ll also ensure to include the hadith and Shinqiti's explanation, especially about the dual meaning of nikah as both marriage and intercourse. I’ll focus on translating accurately, ensuring completeness for each section, especially the part about the idolater’s prohibition and relevant texts from the Book and Sunnah.

Finalizing translation completion
I need to ensure I account for variations like the one using "هـــ" and the full naming details. I'll translate all Arabic terms properly, keeping the consistency in formatting, including "Sunnah" and names like "Ṣakhr," "Safiyyah," and "Madinah," without diacritics when necessary. For completeness, I’ll rewrite the translation, ensuring no truncation with ellipses. I'll make sure everything matches the original text.

P6705 - Explanation of the hadith of the Prophet ﷺ forbidding Marthad from marrying the prostitute Anaq
The author, may Allah have mercy on him, said: [Chapter: Concerning Allah the Exalted’s statement: {The fornicator does not marry except a fornicatress} (al-Nur: 3).
Ibrāhīm ibn Muḥammad al-Taymī narrated to us; Yaḥyā narrated to us, from ʿUbayd Allāh ibn al-Akhnas, from ʿAmr ibn Shuʿayb, from his father, from his grandfather, may Allah be pleased with him, that Marthad ibn Abi Marthad al-Ghanawi used to carry captives in Makkah. In Makkah there was a prostitute called Anaq, and she had been his companion. He said: (I came to the Prophet ﷺ and said: O Messenger of Allah! Shall I marry Anaq? He remained silent toward me. Then it was revealed: {And the fornicatress is not married except by a fornicator or an idolater} (al-Nur: 3). Then he called me, recited it to me, and said: Do not marry her.)]
Imam Abu Dawud al-Sijistani, may Allah have mercy on him, said: [Chapter: Concerning Allah the Exalted’s statement: {And the fornicatress is not married except by a fornicator or an idolater} (al-Nur: 3).]
This noble verse indicates that the fornicator does not marry except a fornicatress or an idolatress, and the fornicatress is not married except by a fornicator or an idolater. Abu Dawud mentioned this chapter heading and cited this hadith under it to make clear that marriage to a fornicatress is not permissible, due to the Prophet’s ﷺ prohibition of it.

P6706 - The ruling on marrying a fornicatress and the statements of the scholars concerning it
The scholars have differed regarding the ruling of marrying a fornicatress. Some of them said that it is permissible for a chaste man to marry a fornicatress, because she is among the slave-women of the Muslims and among the unmarried women about whom Allah the Exalted said: {Marry off the unmarried among you} (al-Nur: 32); so that includes fornicatresses and others besides fornicatresses.
Some of the people of knowledge said that the chaste man does not marry the fornicatress; rather, a fornicator like her marries her. In the hadith that comes after this there occurs: (A flogged fornicator does not marry except one like him). Its meaning, then, is that the chaste man does not marry the fornicatress, and that the fornicator may marry the fornicatress, because their occupying themselves with what is lawful is better than their occupying themselves with what is unlawful.
Among the scholars are those who said that this noble verse is not about marriage; rather, it is about intercourse. Its intent is that the fornicator does not have intercourse with a fornicatress or an idolatress—meaning: he does not commit fornication except with a fornicatress or an idolatress. So “nikah” here is meant as intercourse, because Allah said: “except a fornicator or an idolater.” They said: the idolater has been mentioned, and an idolater can in no case contract marriage to a Muslim woman; it is not permissible for an idolater to marry a Muslim woman, and it is not permissible for a Muslim woman to be married to an idolater. They said: therefore “nikah” here is intended as intercourse, and accordingly the fornicator does not have intercourse except with a fornicatress—meaning: an immoral woman like him—or an idolatress who does not acknowledge what is lawful and what is unlawful. And likewise the reverse: “And the fornicatress is not married except by a fornicator” like her, “or an idolater” who does not distinguish lawful from unlawful and deems fornication permissible.
They said: so mentioning the idolater here indicates that what is meant is intercourse.
But the hadith the author cited here regarding the reason for the revelation of the verse—that the Messenger ﷺ recited it to him and said: (Do not marry her)—indicates that what is meant is marriage.
Our shaykh, Shaykh Muhammad al-Amin al-Shinqiti, may Allah have mercy on him, spoke about this verse in (Adwa' al-Bayan) and said: this is among the most difficult issues, because the contextual indicator in the verse shows that what is meant by “nikah” is intercourse, while the reason for revelation shows that what is meant by “nikah” is marriage. He said: escaping—meaning, from this difficulty—is hard and is not achieved except with a kind of strain and contrivance. Then he pointed to something of that and said: “nikah” is a word shared between the two meanings: it is used for intercourse and for marriage; so it is intended as marriage in one consideration and as intercourse in another.
The meaning of that is that if what is intended by it is intercourse in fornication, that is due to the indication of mentioning the idolater; so what is intended is intercourse because of the contextual indicator of mentioning the idolater. And the hadith in which the Prophet ﷺ forbade him to marry her indicates that what is intended is marriage. Thus the verse is explained by both meanings and carried on both meanings that the wording indicates by shared usage: intercourse and marriage.
The upshot is that marriage to a fornicatress by a chaste man is not permissible, as the hadith indicates. As for the marriage of a fornicator to a fornicatress, it is allowable, due to his ﷺ statement: (A flogged fornicator does not marry except one like him) in the forthcoming hadith. His statement: “flogged” means that his fornication has become apparent and established by the presence of flogging for it; so the fornicator whose fornication has been established does not marry except one like him.
What appears is that the chaste man does not marry the immoral fornicatress; as for the fornicator, he marries her instead of the two of them occupying themselves with what is unlawful.
As for the hadith, it contains that Marthad ibn Abi Marthad al-Ghanawi came to the Prophet ﷺ, and he used to carry captives from Makkah to Madinah. There was in Makkah a prostitute called Anaq, and she had been his companion. He sought the Prophet’s ﷺ permission to marry her, so he recited the verse to him and said to him: (Do not marry her). This indicates that it is not permissible for the chaste man to marry the fornicatress, and that the fornicator may marry the fornicatress who is like him. As for the idolater, it is not permissible for him to marry a Muslim woman at all, due to the texts of the Book and the Sunnah regarding that.
What is meant by the chaste man not marrying the fornicatress is before her repentance. As for when she repents, then repentance wipes out what came before it, and Allah the Exalted accepts repentance from whoever repents; and the chaste man may marry her.

He is Shuʿayb, and he is truthful. Al-Bukhari narrated from him in (Juz' al-Qira'ah) and (al-Adab al-Mufrad), and the authors of the Sunan.
[From his grandfather.]
He is Shuʿayb’s grandfather, and he is ʿAbd Allāh ibn ʿAmr ibn al-ʿĀṣ, may Allah be pleased with them both, the noble Companion, one of the four Abd Allahs among the Companions of the Prophet ﷺ, and his hadith was narrated by the authors of the Six Books.

P6708 - Explanation of the hadith: (A flogged fornicator does not marry except one like him)
The author, may Allah have mercy on him, said: [Musaddad and Abū Muʿammar said: ʿAbd al-Wārith narrated to us, from Ḥabīb, who narrated to me: ʿAmr ibn Shuʿayb, from Saʿīd al-Maqburī, from Abū Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, that he said: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: (A flogged fornicator does not marry except one like him).]
Abu Dawud cited the hadith of Abū Hurayrah: (A flogged fornicator does not marry except one like him). This indicates that the fornicator marries the fornicatress, and that is when both are not repentant. As for when they have repented, then repentance wipes out what came before it; the chaste man may marry the fornicatress if she repents, and likewise the reverse.
His statement: “flogged” means: the one upon whom the legal punishment has been carried out and whose fornication has been established. It has no contrary implication in the sense that the one who was not flogged would not be like that; rather, he is the same. The flogged and the non-flogged are equal in that regard, but it mentioned “flogged” because through it the existence of fornication is established. Flogging is an expiation for him; but if he does not repent, it is an expiation for the sin that occurred from him only. As for if he persists, then the flogging does not expiate his persistence, and he is not married to a chaste woman. But if it happens that a fornicator is contracted in marriage to a chaste woman, the contract is valid and it is not said: the contract is void, even if he is not a suitable match for her.
As for the chaste man, many scholars permitted him to marry the fornicatress, using as evidence Allah the Exalted’s statement: {Marry off the unmarried among you} (al-Nur: 32).

P6709 - Biographies of the men in the chain of the hadith: (A flogged fornicator does not marry except one like him)

[And Abū Muʿammar said: Ḥabīb al-Muʿallim narrated to me, from ʿAmr ibn Shuʿayb.]
Meaning: the wording he cited is upon the wording of the first shaykh, Musaddad; then he informed about the second shaykh. The narration from Abū Muʿammar came with the additional word “al-Muʿallim” appended to Ḥabīb; also, the first was with the wording “from,” while here it is with the wording of direct narration.

P6710 - A man frees his slave-girl, then marries her

P6711 - Explanation of the hadith: (Whoever frees his slave-girl, then marries her, has two rewards)
The author, may Allah have mercy on him, said: [Chapter: A man frees his slave-girl, then marries her.
Hannād ibn al-Sarī narrated to us; ʿAbthar narrated to us, from Muṭarrif, from ʿĀmir, from Abū Burdah, from Abū Mūsā, may Allah be pleased with him, that he said: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: (Whoever frees his slave-girl and marries her has two rewards).]
Abu Dawud cited this chapter heading—[Chapter: A man frees his slave-girl and marries her]—meaning: that this is valid and that it contains tremendous reward. That is because the Prophet ﷺ said, as in the hadith of Abū Mūsā: (He has two rewards), meaning: a reward for his emancipation and a reward for his kindness to her through emancipation and marriage. He married her, and she came to have a right to an allotted turn after previously having no allotted turn. Thus he treated her well by transferring her from a state in which she had no allotted turn to a state in which she is among the wives for whom turns are allotted; so he has two rewards: a reward for his emancipation and his kindness to her by emancipating her, and a reward for his kindness to her by marrying her, and for her becoming among his wives who have the right to an allotted turn.

P6712 - Biographies of the men in the chain of the hadith: (Whoever frees his slave-girl, then marries her, has two rewards)
His statement: [Hannād ibn al-Sarī narrated to us.]
He is Hannād ibn al-Sarī, Abū al-Sarī, and he is trustworthy. Al-Bukhari narrated his hadith in (Khalq Af'al al-'Ibad), and Muslim and the authors of the Sunan.
[ʿAbthar narrated to us.]
ʿAbthar is trustworthy; the authors of the Six Books narrated from him.
[From Muṭarrif.]
He is Muṭarrif ibn Ṭarīf, and he is trustworthy; the authors of the Six Books narrated from him.
[From ʿĀmir.]
He is ʿĀmir ibn Sharāḥīl al-Shaʿbī, and he is trustworthy; the authors of the Six Books narrated from him.
[From Abū Burdah.]
He is Abū Burdah ibn Abī Mūsā al-Ashʿarī, and he is trustworthy; the authors of the Six Books narrated from him.
[From Abū Mūsā.]
He is Abū Mūsā al-Ashʿarī, ʿAbd Allāh ibn Qays, may Allah be pleased with him, and the authors of the Six Books narrated his hadith. Thus, all the men of this chain are narrated from by the authors of the Six Books except for Hannād: al-Bukhari did not narrate from him in the Sahih; rather, he narrated from him in (Khalq Af'al al-'Ibad).

P6713 - Explanation of the hadith of the Prophet ﷺ emancipating Safiyyah and making her emancipation her dower
The author, may Allah have mercy on him, said: [ʿAmr ibn ʿAwn narrated to us; Abū ʿAwānah informed us, from Qatādah and ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz ibn Ṣuhayb, from Anas ibn Mālik, may Allah be pleased with him: (that the Prophet ﷺ emancipated Safiyyah, may Allah be pleased with her, and made her emancipation her dower).]
Abu Dawud cited the hadith of Anas ibn Malik, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Prophet ﷺ married Safiyyah and made her emancipation her dower. Safiyyah is the daughter of Huyayy ibn Akhtab, may Allah be pleased with her, the Mother of the Believers. She had been a slave-girl, so he emancipated her, and the Prophet ﷺ made her emancipation her dower. This indicates what the author wrote the chapter heading for regarding emancipation and marriage: that by doing so he has shown two kindnesses, and that it is permissible to make emancipation a dower, because it is a blessing he bestowed upon her. The scholars differed regarding whether this is specific to the Messenger ﷺ or whether it is for him and others; claiming that it is a special characteristic requires evidence, so the correct view is that it is allowable and permissible, and that it is not among the special characteristics of the Messenger ﷺ.
His statement: (He emancipated Safiyyah and made her emancipation her dower) means: he emancipated her and married her, and her emancipation is her dower.

P6715 - Explanation of Sunan Abu Dawud [237]
The Sacred Law has made clear that what becomes unlawful due to suckling is the same as what becomes unlawful due to lineage, and that the rulings of suckling are like the rulings of lineage: the wet-nurse becomes a mother to the suckling child, her husband—who is the owner of the milk—becomes a father to the suckling child, her children become siblings to the suckling child, and in this manner the prohibition of marriage spreads through ascendants and descendants.

Completing truncated paragraphs
I noticed truncations in P6706 and other sections. In P6711, I left "Thus he treated her well by transferring her..." incomplete. P6708 also ended abruptly after "sin that oc...", and P6713 got cut off at "and tha...". I need to refer to the Arabic lines to fully translate and complete these paragraphs.

Translating Arabic text
I have the Arabic text: "والجلد كفارة له...(etc.)" that talks about flogging as an expiation for sin. If the person doesn’t repent, it only covers the sin they committed, and it doesn’t expiate ongoing sin. I’ll translate it like this:

"Flogging is an expiation for him; but if he does not repent, it is only an expiation for the sin he committed... and he is not to marry a chaste woman." It’s clearer now!

Translating Arabic text from P6711
The Arabic text talks about how the man treated her well by changing her status, giving her a rightful share among the wives. The translation I settle on is:

"Thus he treated her well by transferring her from a state in which she had no share of the allotted turns to a state in which she is among the wives for whom turns are allotted. So he has two rewards: a reward for his emancipation and his kindness to her by emancipation, and a reward for his kindness to her by marriage, and for the fact that she became among his wives who have the right to the allotted turn."

Translating Arabic text from P6713
The Arabic text talks about the author’s intended meaning for a chapter about emancipation and marriage, specifically how those two acts are considered acts of kindness. Here's how I translate it:

"This indicates what the author set the chapter heading for: emancipation and marriage, and that by emancipating her and marrying her, two acts of kindness have come together for him; and that it is permissible that emancipation be a dower, because it is a blessing he bestowed upon her. The scholars differed: is this specific to the Messenger ﷺ, or is it for him and others?"

Fixing translation truncations and adjustments
I realized there are several truncated translations that need to be completed. For example, in the P6705 section, the hadith bracket should reflect the full translation, especially the Qur'an verse. Similarly, I need to fix the cutoff sections in P6706, P6708, P6711, and P6713. I'll ensure all the placeholders and truncations are replaced with the full translations. Also, I’ve slightly adjusted the translation of the phrase about the fornicator not marrying a fornicatress.

P6705 - Explanation of the hadith of the Prophet ﷺ forbidding Marthad from marrying the prostitute Anaq
The author, may Allah have mercy on him, said: [Chapter: Concerning Allah the Exalted’s statement: {The fornicator does not marry except a fornicatress} (al-Nur: 3).
Ibrāhīm ibn Muḥammad al-Taymī narrated to us; Yaḥyā narrated to us, from ʿUbayd Allāh ibn al-Akhnas, from ʿAmr ibn Shuʿayb, from his father, from his grandfather, may Allah be pleased with him, that Marthad ibn Abi Marthad al-Ghanawi used to carry captives in Makkah. In Makkah there was a prostitute called Anaq, and she had been his companion. He said: (I came to the Prophet ﷺ and said: O Messenger of Allah! Shall I marry Anaq? He remained silent toward me. Then it was revealed: {And the fornicatress is not married except by a fornicator or an idolater} (al-Nur: 3). Then he called me, recited it to me, and said: Do not marry her.)]

Imam Abu Dawud al-Sijistani, may Allah have mercy on him, said: [Chapter: Concerning Allah the Exalted’s statement: {And the fornicatress is not married except by a fornicator or an idolater} (al-Nur: 3).]
This noble verse indicates that the fornicator does not marry except a fornicatress or an idolatress, and that the fornicatress is not married except by a fornicator or an idolater. Abu Dawud mentioned this chapter heading and cited this hadith under it to make clear that marriage to a fornicatress is not permissible, due to the Prophet’s ﷺ prohibition of it.

P6706 - The ruling on marrying a fornicatress and the statements of the scholars concerning it
The scholars have differed regarding the ruling of marrying a fornicatress. Some of them said that it is permissible for a chaste man to marry a fornicatress, because she is among the slave-women of the Muslims and among the unmarried women about whom Allah the Exalted said: {Marry off the unmarried among you} (al-Nur: 32); so that includes fornicatresses and others besides fornicatresses.
Some of the people of knowledge said that the chaste man does not marry the fornicatress; rather, a fornicator like her marries her. In the hadith that comes after this there occurs: (A flogged fornicator does not marry except one like him). Its meaning, then, is that the chaste man does not marry the fornicatress, and that the fornicator may marry the fornicatress, because their occupying themselves with what is lawful is better than their occupying themselves with what is unlawful.
Among the scholars are those who said that this noble verse is not about marriage; rather, it is about intercourse. Its intent is that the fornicator does not have intercourse with a fornicatress or an idolatress—meaning: he does not commit fornication except with a fornicatress or an idolatress. So “nikah” here is meant as intercourse, because Allah said: “except a fornicator or an idolater.” They said: the idolater has been mentioned, and an idolater can in no case contract marriage to a Muslim woman; it is not permissible for an idolater to marry a Muslim woman, and it is not permissible for a Muslim woman to be married to an idolater. They said: therefore “nikah” here is intended as intercourse, and accordingly the fornicator does not have intercourse except with a fornicatress—meaning: an immoral woman like him—or an idolatress who does not acknowledge what is lawful and what is unlawful. And likewise the reverse: “And the fornicatress is not married except by a fornicator” like her, “or an idolater” who does not distinguish lawful from unlawful and deems fornication permissible.
They said: so mentioning the idolater here indicates that what is meant is intercourse.
But the hadith the author cited here regarding the reason for the revelation of the verse—that the Messenger ﷺ recited it to him and said: (Do not marry her)—indicates that what is meant is marriage.
Our shaykh, Shaykh Muhammad al-Amin al-Shinqiti, may Allah have mercy on him, spoke about this verse in (Adwa' al-Bayan) and said: this is among the most difficult issues, because the contextual indicator in the verse shows that what is meant by “nikah” is intercourse, while the reason for revelation shows that what is meant by “nikah” is marriage. He said: escaping—meaning, from this difficulty—is hard and is not achieved except with a kind of strain and contrivance. Then he pointed to something of that and said: “nikah” is a word shared between the two meanings: it is used for intercourse and for marriage; so it is intended as marriage in one consideration and as intercourse in another.
The meaning of that is that if what is intended by it is intercourse in fornication, that is due to the indication of mentioning the idolater; so what is intended is intercourse because of the contextual indicator of mentioning the idolater. And the hadith in which the Prophet ﷺ forbade him to marry her indicates that what is intended is marriage. Thus the verse is explained by both meanings and carried on both meanings that the wording indicates by shared usage: intercourse and marriage.
The upshot is that marriage to a fornicatress by a chaste man is not permissible, as the hadith indicates. As for the marriage of a fornicator to a fornicatress, it is allowable, due to his ﷺ statement: (A flogged fornicator does not marry except one like him) in the forthcoming hadith. His statement: “flogged” means that his fornication has become apparent and established by the presence of flogging for it; so the fornicator whose fornication has been established does not marry except one like him.
What appears is that the chaste man does not marry the immoral fornicatress; as for the fornicator, he marries her instead of the two of them occupying themselves with what is unlawful.
As for the hadith, it contains that Marthad ibn Abi Marthad al-Ghanawi came to the Prophet ﷺ, and he used to carry captives from Makkah to Madinah. There was in Makkah a prostitute called Anaq, and she had been his companion. He sought the Prophet’s ﷺ permission to marry her, so he recited the verse to him and said to him: (Do not marry her). This indicates that it is not permissible for the chaste man to marry the fornicatress, and that the fornicator may marry the fornicatress who is like him. As for the idolater, it is not permissible for him to marry a Muslim woman at all, due to the texts of the Book and the Sunnah regarding that.
What is meant by the chaste man not marrying the fornicatress is before her repentance. As for when she repents, then repentance wipes out what came before it, and Allah the Exalted accepts repentance from whoever repents; and the chaste man may marry her.

P6707 - Biographies of the men in the chain of the hadith of the Prophet ﷺ forbidding Marthad from marrying the prostitute Anaq
His statement: [Ibrāhīm ibn Muḥammad al-Taymī narrated to us.]
Ibrāhīm ibn Muḥammad al-Taymī is trustworthy; Abu Dawud and al-Nasa'i narrated from him.
[Yaḥyā narrated to us.]
He is Yaḥyā ibn Saʿīd al-Qaṭṭān, trustworthy; the authors of the Six Books narrated from him.
[From ʿUbayd Allāh ibn al-Akhnas.]
ʿUbayd Allāh ibn al-Akhnas is truthful; the authors of the Six Books narrated from him.
[From ʿAmr ibn Shuʿayb.]
He is ʿAmr ibn Shuʿayb ibn Muḥammad ibn ʿAbd Allāh ibn ʿAmr ibn al-ʿĀṣ, and he is truthful. Al-Bukhari narrated from him in (Juz' al-Qira'ah), and the authors of the Sunan.
[From his father.]
He is Shuʿayb, and he is truthful. Al-Bukhari narrated from him in (Juz' al-Qira'ah) and (al-Adab al-Mufrad), and the authors of the Sunan.
[From his grandfather.]
He is Shuʿayb’s grandfather, and he is ʿAbd Allāh ibn ʿAmr ibn al-ʿĀṣ, may Allah be pleased with them both, the noble Companion, one of the four Abd Allahs among the Companions of the Prophet ﷺ, and his hadith was narrated by the authors of the Six Books.

P6708 - Explanation of the hadith: (A flogged fornicator does not marry except one like him)
The author, may Allah have mercy on him, said: [Musaddad and Abū Muʿammar said: ʿAbd al-Wārith narrated to us, from Ḥabīb; he narrated to me: ʿAmr ibn Shuʿayb, from Saʿīd al-Maqburī, from Abū Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, that he said: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: (A flogged fornicator does not marry except one like him).]
Abu Dawud cited the hadith of Abū Hurayrah: (A flogged fornicator does not marry except one like him). This indicates that the fornicator marries the fornicatress, and that is when both are not repentant. As for when they have repented, then repentance wipes out what came before it; the chaste man may marry the fornicatress if she repents, and likewise the reverse.
His statement: “flogged” means: the one upon whom the legal punishment has been carried out and whose fornication has been established. It has no contrary implication in the sense that the one who was not flogged would not be like that; rather, he is the same. The flogged and the non-flogged are equal in that regard, but it mentioned “flogged” because through it the existence of fornication is established. Flogging is an expiation for him; but if he does not repent, it is an expiation for the sin that occurred from him only. As for if he persists, then the flogging does not expiate his persistence, and he does not marry a chaste woman. Nevertheless, if it happens that a fornicator contracts marriage with a chaste woman, the marriage contract is valid, and it is not said that the contract is invalid, even if he is not a suitable match for her.
As for the chaste man, many scholars permitted him to marry the fornicatress, using as evidence Allah the Exalted’s statement: {Marry off the unmarried among you} (al-Nur: 32).

P6709 - Biographies of the men in the chain of the hadith: (A flogged fornicator does not marry except one like him)

He is ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ibn Ṣakhr al-Dawsī, the Companion of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, and the most prolific of his Companions in hadith without exception—may Allah be pleased with him and grant him pleasure.
[And Abū Muʿammar said: Ḥabīb al-Muʿallim narrated to me, from ʿAmr ibn Shuʿayb.]
Meaning: the wording he cited is upon the wording of the first shaykh, Musaddad; then he informed about the second shaykh. The narration from Abū Muʿammar came with the additional word “al-Muʿallim” appended to Ḥabīb; also, the first was with the wording “from,” while here it is with the wording of direct narration.

P6710 - A man frees his slave-girl, then marries her

P6711 - Explanation of the hadith: (Whoever frees his slave-girl, then marries her, has two rewards)
The author, may Allah have mercy on him, said: [Chapter: A man frees his slave-girl, then marries her.
Hannād ibn al-Sarī narrated to us; ʿAbthar narrated to us, from Muṭarrif, from ʿĀmir, from Abū Burdah, from Abū Mūsā, may Allah be pleased with him, that he said: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: (Whoever frees his slave-girl and marries her has two rewards).]
Abu Dawud cited this chapter heading—[Chapter: A man frees his slave-girl and marries her]—meaning: that this is valid and that it contains tremendous reward. That is because the Prophet ﷺ said, as in the hadith of Abū Mūsā: (He has two rewards), meaning: a reward for his emancipation and a reward for his kindness to her through emancipation and marriage. He married her, and she came to have a right to an allotted turn after previously having no allotted turn. Thus he treated her well by transferring her from a state in which she had no share of the allotted turns to a state in which she is among the wives for whom turns are allotted. So he has two rewards: a reward for his emancipation and his kindness to her by emancipation, and a reward for his kindness to her by marriage, and for the fact that she became among his wives who have the right to the allotted turn.

P6712 - Biographies of the men in the chain of the hadith: (Whoever frees his slave-girl, then marries her, has two rewards)
His statement: [Hannād ibn al-Sarī narrated to us.]
He is Hannād ibn al-Sarī, Abū al-Sarī, and he is trustworthy. Al-Bukhari narrated his hadith in (Khalq Af'al al-'Ibad), and Muslim and the authors of the Sunan.
[ʿAbthar narrated to us.]
ʿAbthar is trustworthy; the authors of the Six Books narrated from him.
[From Muṭarrif.]
He is Muṭarrif ibn Ṭarīf, and he is trustworthy; the authors of the Six Books narrated from him.
[From ʿĀmir.]
He is ʿĀmir ibn Sharāḥīl al-Shaʿbī, and he is trustworthy; the authors of the Six Books narrated from him.
[From Abū Burdah.]
He is Abū Burdah ibn Abī Mūsā al-Ashʿarī, and he is trustworthy; the authors of the Six Books narrated from him.
[From Abū Mūsā.]
He is Abū Mūsā al-Ashʿarī, ʿAbd Allāh ibn Qays, may Allah be pleased with him, and the authors of the Six Books narrated his hadith. Thus, all the men of this chain are narrated from by the authors of the Six Books except for Hannād: al-Bukhari did not narrate from him in the Sahih; rather, he narrated from him in (Khalq Af'al al-'Ibad).

P6713 - Explanation of the hadith of the Prophet ﷺ emancipating Safiyyah and making her emancipation her dower
The author, may Allah have mercy on him, said: [ʿAmr ibn ʿAwn narrated to us; Abū ʿAwānah informed us, from Qatādah and ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz ibn Ṣuhayb, from Anas ibn Mālik, may Allah be pleased with him: (that the Prophet ﷺ emancipated Safiyyah, may Allah be pleased with her, and made her emancipation her dower).]
Abu Dawud cited the hadith of Anas ibn Malik, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Prophet ﷺ married Safiyyah and made her emancipation her dower. Safiyyah is the daughter of Huyayy ibn Akhtab, may Allah be pleased with her, the Mother of the Believers. She had been a slave-girl, so he emancipated her, and the Prophet ﷺ made her emancipation her dower. This indicates what the author wrote the chapter heading for regarding emancipation and marriage: that by emancipating her and marrying her, two kindnesses have come together for him; and that it is permissible for emancipation to be a dower, because it is a blessing he bestowed upon her. The scholars differed regarding whether this is specific to the Messenger ﷺ or whether it is for him and others. To claim it as a special characteristic requires evidence, so the correct view is that it is permissible and legislated, and that it is not among the special characteristics by which the Messenger ﷺ was singled out.
His statement: (He emancipated Safiyyah and made her emancipation her dower) means: he emancipated her and married her, and her emancipation is her dower.

P6714 - Biographies of the men in the chain of the hadith of the Prophet ﷺ emancipating Safiyyah and making her emancipation her dower
His statement: [ʿAmr ibn ʿAwn narrated to us.]
ʿAmr ibn ʿAwn is trustworthy; the authors of the Six Books narrated from him.
[Abū ʿAwānah informed us.]
He is al-Waḍḍāḥ ibn ʿAbd Allāh al-Yashkurī; he is trustworthy; the authors of the Six Books narrated from him.
[From Qatādah.]
He is Qatādah ibn Diʿāmah al-Sadūsī al-Baṣrī, and he is trustworthy; the authors of the Six Books narrated from him.
[And ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz ibn Ṣuhayb.]
ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz ibn Ṣuhayb is trustworthy; the authors of the Six Books narrated from him.
[From Anas ibn Mālik.]
He is Anas ibn Mālik, may Allah be pleased with him, the Companion of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and his servant, and one of the seven known for abundant narration from the Prophet ﷺ.
This chain is four-narrator: Qatādah and ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz are in one rank, so it is a four-narrator chain, and it is among the highest chains with Abu Dawud.

P6715 - Explanation of Sunan Abu Dawud [237]
The Sacred Law has made clear that what becomes unlawful due to suckling is the same as what becomes unlawful due to lineage, and that the rulings of suckling are like the rulings of lineage: the wet-nurse becomes a mother to the suckling child, her husband—who is the owner of the milk—becomes a father to the suckling child, her children become siblings to the suckling child, and in this manner the prohibition of marriage spreads through ascendants and descendants.

I see now that I may have left some paragraphs unfinished in the translation, particularly where I had the curly braces and ellipses, such as in "Then it was revealed: {And the fornicatress is ...". I should complete these sections properly to avoid incomplete or missing parts from the final translation.

Checking for missing content in final translation
I realized that I mistakenly truncated part of the text, particularly with the “Then it was revealed: {And the fornicatress is ...” ending. This isn’t acceptable. I need to check and ensure the full hadith text is included. I’ll look for “Then he called me” and verify if it’s fully in the translation.

Verifying verse completeness in translation
a = final_translation.find("Then it was revealed:")
b = final_translation.find("Then he called me")
a,b

(843, 954)
Verifying completeness of hadith and verse
The hadith does include "Then he called me," so it's complete. However, the verse could have been truncated during output. I’ll carefully check the substring between the indices to confirm if the verse has been fully included. This should help ensure everything is in place.

Inspecting substring between specified indices
sub = final_translation[a:b]
sub

'Then it was revealed: {And the fornicatress is not married except by a fornicator or an idolater} (al-Nur: 3). '
Clarifying placeholder issues and checking substring
The translation's complete, but I noticed some remaining placeholder segments like “an idolater can in no case contract marriage to a Muslim woman; ...”. I thought I removed the ellipsis, but there's still a trailing “...”? I’ll double-check the substring around it to verify if it’s actually using ellipses or something else that’s causing confusion.

Troubleshooting truncated words and ellipsis replacement
idx=final_translation.find("Muslim woman")
print(final_translation[idx:idx+300])

Muslim woman; it is not permissible for an idolater to marry a Muslim woman, and it is not permissible for a Muslim woman to be married to an idolater. They said: therefore “nikah” here is intended as intercourse, and accordingly the fornicator does not have intercourse except with a fornicatress—me
Verifying truncation and handling "..."
Okay, it looks like the output's showing "M...rnicator," which might be Jupyter truncation due to output formatting, not actual content. Since we used a 300-slice, I’ll check if the slice contains "..." by counting the characters, and I’ll verify if there are unprintable symbols involved. Let’s see if we can clarify this.

Verifying truncation and ellipsis in slice output
slice300=final_translation[idx:idx+300]
slice300.count("..."), "..." in slice300

(0, False)
Addressing truncated paragraphs and placeholders
It looks like I've left placeholders like "sin that oc..." and incomplete phrases in P6708, P6711, and P6713, because I intended to come back to them later. I used "oc..." instead of writing the full word "occurred." I’ll need to correct these and fill in the full translations properly. Let's search for "oc..." and confirm.

Searching for incomplete translations in final_translation
"sin that oc" in final_translation

True
Fixing truncated phrases in translations
Looks like I'm still seeing truncation with phrases like "sin that oc..." and "Thus he treated her well by transferring her...". These need to be corrected, as they're incomplete. I'll search for "transferring her" to find the full text and ensure I fill in the gaps properly.

Correcting truncated phrases in translation
"transferring her..." in final_translation, "transferring her" in final_translation

(False, True)
Expanding incomplete translations
It has "transferring her," but that part might be cut off, so I'll need to expand it properly. I’ll search for "two kindne" next to address truncation in that part too and fill in any necessary details to make sure everything is complete and accurate.

Searching for phrase "two kindne" in text
"two kindne" in final_translation

True
Fixing truncated translations
There are still truncated sections that need to be fixed by replacing them with the full, complete translation. For P6708, I'll replace the truncated sentence starting with "Flogging is an expiation..." with the full text. Same for the others in P6711 and P6713. Additionally, I'll check P6705 for any potential truncation at the start of the bracketed part.

Fixing truncated sentences and replacing with full text
import re
m=re.search(r"Then it was revealed: \{.*?\}\s*\(al-Nur: 3\)", final_translation)
m.group(0)[:200]

'Then it was revealed: {And the fornicatress is not married except by a fornicator or an idolater} (al-Nur: 3)'
Patching truncated sections
I’ll fix these truncated sections in final_translation by replacing the placeholders with the full text. In P6708, I will update from "Flogging is an expiation for him..." to the section ending just before "As for the chaste man." For P6711, I'll replace the text after "Thus he treated her well by transferring her..." until the end of the paragraph. P6713 will also be patched from "two kindne..." until just before "His statement: (He emancipated Safiyyah." As for P6706, it's already complete.

Checking for missing phrases in P6706
In P6706, I see the phrase "Then he pointed to something of that..."—was this incomplete? I might have missed the final part about "nikah" being a shared word. I need to verify if I left it out. I’ll search for occurrences of "shared between" or "common" to make sure it’s complete.

Checking translation for missing "shared" text
"shared" in final_translation

True
Verifying truncation in P6706
It looks like I might have missed some important details around "Then he pointed to something of that..." since the translation doesn't follow through. I need to double-check and make sure the full suggestion about "shared word" is included. I'll look up "Then he pointed to something of that" to verify if there's more context.

Verifying translation of truncated Shinqiti text
start=final_translation.find("Then he pointed to something of that")
end=final_translation.find("The meaning of that is", start)
final_translation[start:end]

'Then he pointed to something of that and said: “nikah” is a word shared between the two meanings: it is used for intercourse and for marriage; so it is intended as marriage in one consideration and as intercourse in another.\n'
Checking for output truncation issue
It seems the string might be truncated based on the "wor..." segment. I should verify this by searching for "wor..." and check how the output is being cut off. I'll do this by looking at smaller slices of the string to pinpoint where the truncation happens.

Checking substring for truncation presence
chunk=final_translation[start:end]
chunk.count("..."), "..." in chunk, len(chunk)

(0, False, 225)
Verifying missing explanation in chunk
There isn't an ellipsis, but I'm wondering if the chunk includes the explanation that seems to be missing. To check, I'll split the chunk and display it in smaller parts, like slicing it into pieces of

Displaying chunk by slicing in segments
for i in range(0,len(chunk),75):
    print(chunk[i:i+75])

Then he pointed to something of that and said: “nikah” is a word shared bet
ween the two meanings: it is used for intercourse and for marriage; so it i
s intended as marriage in one consideration and as intercourse in another.

Patching truncated paragraphs
It looks like we’re almost there! Now, I’ll focus on patching the remaining truncated paragraphs. Using Python’s replace functions, I can make sure to restore those missing parts and complete the translations accurately. Time to get everything finalized and polished!

Patching truncated paragraphs with Python replace
patched = final_translation

# Patch P6708 expiation paragraph truncated
start = patched.find("Flogging is an expiation for him;")
end = patched.find("As for the chaste man,", start)
segment = patched[start:end]
segment[:200], segment[-100:]

('Flogging is an expiation for him; but if he does not repent, it is an expiation for the sin that occurred from him only. As for if he persists, then the flogging does not expiate his persistence, and ',
 'valid, and it is not said that the contract is invalid, even if he is not a suitable match for her.\n')
Inspecting text for truncation
It looks like there might be a truncation issue. The segment shows "i...ists," but it could actually be complete. I’ll check the substring "oc" to see if it matches "occurred" or other words fully, and confirm if any words were cut off. Let’s check the actual segment carefully.

Evaluating string truncation and completeness
# check if segment includes "oc" incomplete
"oc..." in segment, "oc" in segment[:100]

(False, True)
Checking for "occur" in segment
"occur" in segment, segment.find("occur")

(True, 97)
Checking for occurrence of "occur" in segment
pos=segment.find("occur")
segment[pos:pos+30]

'occurred from him only. As for'
The instructions say I should only transliterate the names of narrators in the chain using ALA-LC, without Arabic characters, except for ﷺ. For names outside the chain, I should leave them in English without transliteration. I'll follow this guidance strictly, focusing on the text as specified.

Deciding on transliteration consistency
Okay, so the instructions say to only use ALA-LC transliteration for narrator names in the isnād chain. Outside of that, I shouldn't transliterate general words like "ḥadīth" or "al-wakālah." Even if names appear in an explanation, I'll have to stick to only transliterating them in the isnād context, not elsewhere.

Handling non-narrator Arabic terms and translations
I need to stick to the guidelines. For technical terms like "ḥadīth" or "fiqh" terms, I’ll write them without diacritics in English — for example, "hadith" instead of "ḥadīth." For narrator names, I can keep the diacritics, like "Muḥammad." Any Arabic brackets will be translated into English, including their meaning. No Arabic script is allowed in translations.

Deciding on diacritics and transliteration for non-chain names
For names in explanatory text outside the isnād chain, I should simplify to common English spellings, like "Ahmad ibn..." without diacritics. Keeping diacritics outside the chain might cause confusion, so I'm sticking to the instruction of only using them for narrator names inside the chain.

Deciding on translation and transliteration of terms
For the chain, I'll transliterate each narrator's name using ALA-LC with diacritics, like "Aḥmad ibn Thābit al-Marwazī." For technical terms, I'll translate them directly into English (e.g., "truthful," "trustworthy," "narration using 'ʿan'"), avoiding transliteration unless it’s for a narrator’s name.

Translating Qur'anic verses and citations
For Qur'anic verses, I'll use "Quran 4:2" instead of transliterating the Surah name to avoid diacritics. I'll translate the verse content directly, like “And give the orphans their property,” and include citations in plain text. I'll place citations at the end, being careful about format and file references.

Retrieving needed file segments
I need to retrieve all the segments between P6846 and P6868 for translation. While the initial snippet helps, I’ll need the full content, including P6847, P6848, and others, which might not have appeared in the msearch. I’ll try running another search to get everything I need.

Acquiring remaining segments and translation

We might need to open the whole file from P6846 to P6868, using the file from /mnt/data/pasted.txt.

Translating full content and maintaining structure
Okay, seems like we need to translate the entire file content since the user referred to "Translate the following Arabic text." I’ll ensure that each segment maintains its ID (like P6846), followed by the heading and translation. We’ll remove Arabic text but preserve transliteration for names and citations. Hadith chains won’t have Arabic script either.

Handling Arabic in hadith and translating terms
For hadith and isnad sections, I’ll transliterate names with diacritics and leave phrases like "صلى الله عليه وسلم" as ﷺ. Terms like "رضي الله عنه" will be translated as "may Allah be pleased with him." I’ll convert Arabic-Indic digits to Western digits and ensure no Arabic characters are left except for ﷺ. I'll translate all segments carefully.

Considering revisions and transliteration rules
I need to revise the translation three times internally to ensure accuracy. For the chains of narration, I’ll follow the ALA-LC transliteration for narrator names but not for textual content. For example, "مسلم بن إبراهيم" becomes "Muslim ibn Ibrāhīm," while "عن أبيه" translates as "from his father" without transliteration for the father’s name. I'll use "narrated to us" or "narrated to me" based on the context.

Translating the "ḥāʾ" transition in hadith
The "ḥāʾ" in hadith notation typically indicates "and" or a transition. Since the instructions specify transliteration only for narrator names, I think it's best to translate it by meaning. I'll use "Another chain:" or "A shift:" instead of transliterating it as "ḥ:" or "Ḥ:". This keeps the meaning intact.

Translating the hadith quote
For the quote "(لا تنكح الثيب حتى تستأمر...)", I’ll translate it as: “A previously married woman is not to be married off until she is consulted, and a virgin not except with her permission. They said: O Messenger of Allah, and what is her permission? He said: That she remains silent.”

I’ll use “previously married woman” for "thayyib" and “virgin” for "bikr," and “until she is asked for her command/approval” for "tustamr." The phrase "لا جواز عليها" will translate to "she is not to be compelled." I'll keep these terms simple while aiming for accuracy.

وإذا رجع المتأمل إلى التقريب للبحث عن أحمد بن ثابت لا يجد أحداً روى له أبو داود بهذا الاسم، وإنما يجد شخصاً واحداً روى له ابن ماجة هو أحمد بن ثابت.
فالشخص قد يكون منسوباً إلى جده كما حصل هنا، لأنه منسوب إلى جده، فإذا بحث عنه وحصل اسم أبيه فإنه يجد الترجمة عند ذكر اسم أبيه.
ويقال له: أحمد بن شبويه كما جاء في الإسناد الثاني؛ لأن أحمد بن ثابت هو أحمد بن شبويه فهو شخص واحد عبر عنه في الإسناد بـ أحمد بن ثابت منسوباً إلى جده وعبر عنه بـ ابن شبويه بهذا الذي اشتهر به، وهو ثقة أخرج له أبو داود.

P6849 - الأسئلة

P6850 - الإذن في الوكالة عن الولي في الزواج

P6850a - السؤال
هل يلزم الوكيل عن الولي أن يحصل على الإذن من الولي في التوكيل؟

P6850b - الجواب
الوكيل لا يكون وكيلاً إلا بإذن من الولي، والوكالة العامة هنا لا تكفي، فتولي العقد للمرأة يحتاج إلى توكيل خاص.

P6851 - حكم الدخول بالمعقود عليها دون ولي

P6851a - السؤال
إذا أصاب رجل امرأة قد عقد عليها بدون ولي فهل يفسخ العقد ويعيده مرة أخرى مع وجود الولي، أو إن رضي الولي كفى العقد الأول؟

P6851b - الجواب
لا يكفي العقد الأول، بل لو تزوجت بغير إذن مواليها فنكاحها باطل، فهي لو زوجت نفسها فلا يصح لها ذلك؛ لأن هذا مخالف لما جاءت به السنة ولما جاء في القرآن الكريم، ولكنه يكون -كما هو معلوم- نكاح شبهة، حيث قال صلى الله عليه وسلم: (فإن دخل بها فلها المهر بما أصاب منها).

P6852 - حكم ولاية الابن لأمه في الزواج

P6852a - السؤال
هل الابن يكون ولياً لأمه؟

P6852b - الجواب
نعم يكون ولياً إذا كان بالغاً؛ لأنه من عصبتها.

P6853 - استواء الولاية على البكر والولاية على الثيب

P6853a - السؤال
هل يفرق في الولاية بين البكر والثيب؟

P6853b - الجواب
ولي البكر هو ولي الثيب، والولاية على الثيب والولاية على البكر واحدة.

P6854 - حكم ولاية تارك الصلاة

P6854a - السؤال
إذا كان أبو المرأة تاركاً للصلاة فهل يكون ولياً؟

P6854b - الجواب
لا يكون ولياً إذا كان تاركاً للصلاة، بل تنتقل الولاية إلى غيره.

P6855 - حكم عقد الرجل النكاح لأخت زوجته وما يصنع فيه

P6855a - السؤال
لي عمة في جِدَّة لم يعقد لها وليها، وإنما عقد لها زوج أختها، وهو أجنبي عنها، ولها الآن بنت عمرها ثمان سنوات، وإخوانها خارج المملكة، وقد مات أبوها ولا ابن لها، فمن يعقد لها؟ وهل يجوز لي أن أعقد لها؟

P6855b - الجواب
يرجع الأمر في هذا إلى المحكمة، وهي التي تتخذ ما تراه حول الزواج السابق وحول الذي حصل وحول ما يستقبل.

P6856 - حكم تزويج القاضي المرأة لرجل رفضه وليها

P6856a - السؤال
تزوج رجل من امرأة بغير إذن وليها، وكان القاضي هو وليها، والسبب أن وليها رفض الزواج بسبب التزامه وأنه ذو لحية، فهل يصح هذا النكاح؟

P6856b - الجواب
إذا كان القاضي قد زوجها فالزواج صحيح؛ لأن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم قال: (فالسلطان ولي من لا ولي له) وإذا كان العضل قد حصل من الأب لأشياء معينة في الزوج فليراجع في ذلك القاضي، وإذا كان هناك اعتراض على هذا فليراجع من فوق القاضي.

P6857 - الترتيب في ولاية الأولياء

P6857a - السؤال
قوله صلى الله عليه وسلم: (أيما امرأة زوجها وليان فهي للأول منهما)، أليس فيه اعتبار الترتيب بين الأولياء كالأب والأخ مثلاً؟

P6857b - الجواب
الأصل هو اعتبار الترتيب، فليس لأحد أن يتعدى، لكن من حيث العموم فالأخ يعتبر ولياً، ولكن ولايته متأخرة.

P6858 - شرح سنن أبي داود [٢٤١]
حفظ الإسلام حق المرأة في اختيار الزوج والرضا به، فلا يجوز إجبارها على أن تنكح رجلاً لا ترضاه، بل يجب على الولي أن يستأذنها في أمر نكاحها، ويكفي للدلالة على رضا البكر سكوتها.

P6859 - استئمار الثيب والبكر في النكاح

P6860 - شرح حديث (لا تنكح الثيب حتى تستأمر ولا البكر إلا بإذنها)
قال المصنف رحمه الله تعالى: [باب في الاستئمار.
حدثنا مسلم بن إبراهيم حدثنا أبان حدثنا يحيى عن أبي سلمة عن أبي هريرة رضي الله عنه عن النبي صلى الله عليه وعلى آله وسلم قال: (لا تنكح الثيب حتى تستأمر، ولا البكر إلا بإذنها.
قالوا: يا رسول الله! وما إذنها؟ قال: أن تسكت)].
يقول الإمام أبو داود رحمه الله: [باب في الاستئمار].
والاستئمار هو طلب الأمر من المرأة حين يعرض عليها الأزواج بأن توافق أو ترفض.
والاستئمار غالباً يأتي مع الثيبات؛ لأنهن اللاتي لابد لهن من أن ينطقن وأن يتكلمن بما يردنه من الرغبة فيمن يعرض عليهن أو الرفض، وأما الأبكار فقد جاء كثيراً التعبير في حقهن بالاستئذان، وجاء في بعض الأحاديث الاستئمار، لكن لا يلزم في حق البكر أنها تنطق كما هو مطلوب من الثيب، وإنما يكفي أن تصمت وأن تسكت؛ لأن الأبكار يغلب عليهن الحياء؛ لأن هذا شيء جديد عليهن، بخلاف الثيبات، فقد سبق لهن أن عاشرن الأزواج واتصلن بالأزواج فصارت الثيب يعبر عن طلب رأيها بالاستئمار، وأنه لابد من نطقها بما تريد، وأما الأبكار فيعبر في حقهن بالاستئذان، ويعبر بالاستئمار، لكنه لا يلزمها ما يلزم الثيب من النطق، بل إن نطقت فقد تبين مرادها بنطقها، وإن لم تنطق ولكنها سكتت لما يغلب عليها من الحياء فإن ذلك يكون كافياً، كما جاء بيان ذلك في حديث الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم.
وقد أورد الإمام أبو داود رحمه الله حديث أبي هريرة رضي الله عنه أن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم قال: (لا تنكح الثيب حتى تستأمر، ولا البكر إلا بإذنها.
قالوا: يا رسول الله! وما أذنها؟ قال: أن تسكت)، فهذا الحديث فيه الحكم المتعلق بالثيبات والحكم المتعلق بالأبكار، وفيه التفريق بين الثيبات والأبكار؛ لأن الثيبات مطلوب نطقهن وإفصاحهن بما يردن من الرغبة أو الامتناع، وأما الأبكار فإن حصل منهن النطق فقد اتضح مرادهن بنطقهن، وإن لم يحصل منهن وسكتن فسكوتهن يعتبر دليلاً على رضاهن.
وقد بين رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم في هذا الحديث أن إذنها أن تصمت، وأنه لا يلزم أن تنطق كما يلزم في حق الثيب، وعلى هذا فالحديث واضح في التفريق بين الثيبات والأبكار؛ لأن الثيبات لابد لهن من النطق، ولهذا يأتي التعبير بالاستئمار أو بالأمر بأنها تستأمر، وأما الأبكار فإنه يأتي التعبير في حقهن بالإذن والتعبير بالاستئمار أو بالأمر، ولكن نطقهن ليس بلازم، بل يكفي السكوت والصمت، فهو دليل على موافقتها وعدم امتناعها، وأما إن رفضت وتكلمت وقالت: إنها لا تريد فإنها لا تجبر ولا تلزم.

P6862 - شرح حديث (تستأمر اليتيمة في نفسها)
قال المصنف رحمه الله تعالى: [حدثنا أبو كامل حدثنا يزيد -يعني ابن زريع -.
ح: حدثنا موسى بن إسماعيل حدثنا حماد -المعنى- حدثني محمد بن عمرو حدثنا أبو سلمة عن أبي هريرة رضي الله عنه قال: قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وعلى آله وسلم: (تستأمر اليتيمة في نفسها، فإن سكتت فهو إذنها، وإن أبت فلا جواز عليها) والإخبار في حديث يزيد].
أورد أبو داود حديث أبي هريرة رضي الله عنه أن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم قال: [(تستأمر اليتيمة في نفسها)]، والمقصود باليتيمة التي مات أبوها ووليها غيره، فإنه يستأمرها، يعني: يطلب منها أن تخبر بالرغبة فيمن يعرض عليها من الأزواج أو الرفض، والمقصود باليتيمة باعتبار ما كان؛ لأنها لا تستأذن وهي في حال يتمها، ولكنه باعتبار ما كان لها من اليتم، وإنما يكون ذلك بعد البلوغ، فبعد بلوغها تستأمر وتستأذن، ولا يلزم أن تنطق، بل يكفي أن تصمت، وعبر عنها باليتم باعتبار ما كان، وهو ما قبل البلوغ؛ لأن هذا الوصف كان معها، فعوملت بعد بلوغها معاملة ما كان قبل البلوغ من إطلاق اليتم عليها.
وهذا نظير قول الله عز وجل: {وَآتُوا الْيَتَامَى أَمْوَالَهُمْ} [النساء: ٢]، ومعلوم أن اليتيم لا يعطى ماله إلا بعد أن يبلغ ويرشد، ولهذا يقول الله عز وجل: {وَابْتَلُوا الْيَتَامَى حَتَّى إِذَا بَلَغُوا النِّكَاحَ فَإِنْ آنَسْتُمْ مِنْهُمْ رُشْدًا فَادْفَعُوا إِلَيْهِمْ أَمْوَالَهُمْ} [النساء: ٦]، ومعناه أنه بعد البلوغ، ولكنه أطلق اليتم باعتبار ما كان لا باعتبار الحال، أي أنه كان يتيماً فيما مضى فاستعمل معه هذا الوصف بعد البلوغ.
قوله: [(تستأمر اليتيمة في نفسها فإن سكتت فهو إذنها)].
هذا يدل على أن سكوت الأبكار إذن منهن، وأنه لا يلزم النطق، وهذا فيه -كما أشرت- أن الاستئمار يطلق أيضاً في حق من لا يلزمه النطق.
قوله: [(وإن أبت فلا جواز عليها)].
يعني: لا تجبر على الزواج، فما دام أنها رفضت وأنها لم توافق وامتنعت عن الزواج بمن عرض عليها فإنه لا جواز عليها، فلا يجوز أن تجبر على تزويجها.

Handling ellipses in file content
It looks like the ellipses ("...") may have been inserted either by the user when pasting the text or as a truncation in the file due to a length limit. Since the ellipses indicate omitted content in Arabic, I’ll keep them in the translation to preserve the meaning. The full context may have been omitted in the file.

Investigating file truncation mystery
It seems there's a mismatch. The file snippet earlier had the full chain, but the local file seems truncated with ellipses. I think the file at /mnt/data/pasted.txt may have originated from a developer message, with ellipses inserted to shorten the content. I’ll inspect the file further to clarify.

قوله: [حدثنا أحمد بن شبويه المروزي].
هو أحمد بن محمد بن ثابت المروزي الذي مر في الإسناد السابق، وهو منسوب إلى جده ثابت في الإسناد الأول؛ لأنه قال: أحمد بن ثابت وهو: [أحمد بن محمد بن ثابت].
وإذا رجع المتأمل إلى التقريب للبحث عن أحمد بن ثابت لا يجد أحداً روى له أبو داود بهذا الاسم، وإنما يجد شخصاً واحداً روى له ابن ماجة هو أحمد بن ثابت.
فالشخص قد يكون منسوباً إلى جده كما حصل هنا، لأنه منسوب إلى جده، فإذا بحث عنه وحصل اسم أبيه فإنه يجد الترجمة عند ذكر اسم أبيه.
ويقال له: أحمد بن شبويه كما جاء في الإسناد الثاني؛ لأن أحمد بن ثابت هو أحمد بن شبويه فهو شخص واحد عبر عنه في الإسناد بـ أحمد بن ثابت منسوباً إلى جده وعبر عنه بـ ابن شبويه بهذا الذي اشتهر به، وهو ثقة أخرج له أبو داود.

P6849 - الأسئلة

P6850 - الإذن في الوكالة عن الولي في الزواج

P6850a - السؤال
هل يلزم الوكيل عن الولي أن يحصل على الإذن من الولي في التوكيل؟

P6850b - الجواب
الوكيل لا يكون وكيلاً إلا بإذن من الولي، والوكالة العامة هنا لا تكفي، فتولي العقد للمرأة يحتاج إلى توكيل خاص.

P6851 - حكم الدخول بالمعقود عليها دون ولي

P6851a - السؤال
إذا أصاب رجل امرأة قد عقد عليها بدون ولي فهل يفسخ العقد ويعيده مرة أخرى مع وجود الولي، أو إن رضي الولي كفى العقد الأول؟

P6851b - الجواب
لا يكفي العقد الأول، بل لو تزوجت بغير إذن مواليها فنكاحها باطل، فهي لو زوجت نفسها فلا يصح لها ذلك؛ لأن هذا مخالف لما جاءت به السنة ولما جاء في القرآن الكريم، ولكنه يكون -كما هو معلوم- نكاح شبهة، حيث قال صلى الله عليه وسلم: (فإن دخل بها فلها المهر بما أصاب منها).

P6852 - حكم ولاية الابن لأمه في الزواج

P6852a - السؤال
هل الابن يكون ولياً لأمه؟

P6852b - الجواب
نعم يكون ولياً إذا كان بالغاً؛ لأنه من عصبتها.

P6853 - استواء الولاية على البكر والولاية على الثيب

P6853a - السؤال
هل يفرق في الولاية بين البكر والثيب؟

P6853b - الجواب
ولي البكر هو ولي الثيب، والولاية على الثيب والولاية على البكر واحدة.

P6854 - حكم ولاية تارك الصلاة

P6854a - السؤال
إذا كان أبو المرأة تاركاً للصلاة فهل يكون ولياً؟

P6854b - الجواب
لا يكون ولياً إذا كان تاركاً للصلاة، بل تنتقل الولاية إلى غيره.

P6855 - حكم عقد الرجل النكاح لأخت زوجته وما يصنع فيه

P6855a - السؤال
لي عمة في جِدَّة لم يعقد لها وليها، وإنما عقد لها زوج أختها، وهو أجنبي عنها، ولها الآن بنت عمرها ثمان سنوات، وإخوانها خارج المملكة، وقد مات أبوها ولا ابن لها، فمن يعقد لها؟ وهل يجوز لي أن أعقد لها؟

P6855b - الجواب
يرجع الأمر في هذا إلى المحكمة، وهي التي تتخذ ما تراه حول الزواج السابق وحول الذي حصل وحول ما يستقبل.

P6856 - حكم تزويج القاضي المرأة لرجل رفضه وليها

P6856a - السؤال
تزوج رجل من امرأة بغير إذن وليها، وكان القاضي هو وليها، والسبب أن وليها رفض الزواج بسبب التزامه وأنه ذو لحية، فهل يصح هذا النكاح؟

P6856b - الجواب
إذا كان القاضي قد زوجها فالزواج صحيح؛ لأن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم قال: (فالسلطان ولي من لا ولي له) وإذا كان العضل قد حصل من الأب لأشياء معينة في الزوج فليراجع في ذلك القاضي، وإذا كان هناك اعتراض على هذا فليراجع من فوق القاضي.

P6857 - الترتيب في ولاية الأولياء

P6857a - السؤال
قوله صلى الله عليه وسلم: (أيما امرأة زوجها وليان فهي للأول منهما)، أليس فيه اعتبار الترتيب بين الأولياء كالأب والأخ مثلاً؟

P6857b - الجواب
الأصل هو اعتبار الترتيب، فليس لأحد أن يتعدى، لكن من حيث العموم فالأخ يعتبر ولياً، ولكن ولايته متأخرة.

P6858 - شرح سنن أبي داود [٢٤١]
حفظ الإسلام حق المرأة في اختيار الزوج والرضا به، فلا يجوز إجبارها على أن تنكح رجلاً لا ترضاه، بل يجب على الولي أن يستأذنها في أمر نكاحها، ويكفي للدلالة على رضا البكر سكوتها.

P6859 - استئمار الثيب والبكر في النكاح

P6860 - شرح حديث (لا تنكح الثيب حتى تستأمر ولا البكر إلا بإذنها)
قال المصنف رحمه الله تعالى: [باب في الاستئمار.
حدثنا مسلم بن إبراهيم حدثنا أبان حدثنا يحيى عن أبي سلمة عن أبي هريرة رضي الله عنه عن النبي صلى الله عليه وعلى آله وسلم قال: (لا تنكح الثيب حتى تستأمر، ولا البكر إلا بإذنها.
قالوا: يا رسول الله! وما إذنها؟ قال: أن تسكت)].
يقول الإمام أبو داود رحمه الله: [باب في الاستئمار].
والاستئمار هو طلب الأمر من المرأة حين يعرض عليها الأزواج بأن توافق أو ترفض.
والاستئمار غالباً يأتي مع الثيبات؛ لأنهن اللاتي لابد لهن من أن ينطقن وأن يتكلمن بما يردنه من الرغبة فيمن يعرض عليهن أو الرفض، وأما الأبكار فقد جاء كثيراً التعبير في حقهن بالاستئذان، وجاء في بعض الأحاديث الاستئمار، لكن لا يلزم في حق البكر أنها تنطق كما هو مطلوب من الثيب، وإنما يكفي أن تصمت وأن تسكت؛ لأن الأبكار يغلب عليهن الحياء؛ لأن هذا شيء جديد عليهن، بخلاف الثيبات، فقد سبق لهن أن عاشرن الأزواج واتصلن بالأزواج فصارت الثيب يعبر عن طلب رأيها بالاستئمار، وأنه لابد من نطقها بما تريد، وأما الأبكار فيعبر في حقهن بالاستئذان، ويعبر بالاستئمار، لكنه لا يلزمها ما يلزم الثيب من النطق، بل إن نطقت فقد تبين مرادها بنطقها، وإن لم تنطق ولكنها سكتت لما يغلب عليها من الحياء فإن ذلك يكون كافياً، كما جاء بيان ذلك في حديث الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم.
وقد أورد الإمام أبو داود رحمه الله حديث أبي هريرة رضي الله عنه أن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم قال: (لا تنكح الثيب حتى تستأمر، ولا البكر إلا بإذنها.
قالوا: يا رسول الله! وما أذنها؟ قال: أن تسكت)، فهذا الحديث فيه الحكم المتعلق بالثيبات والحكم المتعلق بالأبكار، وفيه التفريق بين الثيبات والأبكار؛ لأن الثيبات مطلوب نطقهن وإفصاحهن بما يردن من الرغبة أو الامتناع، وأما الأبكار فإن حصل منهن النطق فقد اتضح مرادهن بنطقهن، وإن لم يحصل منهن وسكتن فسكوتهن يعتبر دليلاً على رضاهن.
وقد بين رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم في هذا الحديث أن إذنها أن تصمت، وأنه لا يلزم أن تنطق كما يلزم في حق الثيب، وعلى هذا فالحديث واضح في التفريق بين الثيبات والأبكار؛ لأن الثيبات لابد لهن من النطق، ولهذا يأتي التعبير بالاستئمار أو بالأمر بأنها تستأمر، وأما الأبكار فإنه يأتي التعبير في حقهن بالإذن والتعبير بالاستئمار أو بالأمر، ولكن نطقهن ليس بلازم، بل يكفي السكوت والصمت، فهو دليل على موافقتها وعدم امتناعها، وأما إن رفضت وتكلمت وقالت: إنها لا تريد فإنها لا تجبر ولا تلزم.

P6862 - شرح حديث (تستأمر اليتيمة في نفسها)
قال المصنف رحمه الله تعالى: [حدثنا أبو كامل حدثنا يزيد -يعني ابن زريع -.
ح: حدثنا موسى بن إسماعيل حدثنا حماد -المعنى- حدثني محمد بن عمرو حدثنا أبو سلمة عن أبي هريرة رضي الله عنه قال: قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وعلى آله وسلم: (تستأمر اليتيمة في نفسها، فإن سكتت فهو إذنها، وإن أبت فلا جواز عليها) والإخبار في حديث يزيد].
أورد أبو داود حديث أبي هريرة رضي الله عنه أن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم قال: [(تستأمر اليتيمة في نفسها)]، والمقصود باليتيمة التي مات أبوها ووليها غيره، فإنه يستأمرها، يعني: يطلب منها أن تخبر بالرغبة فيمن يعرض عليها من الأزواج أو الرفض، والمقصود باليتيمة باعتبار ما كان؛ لأنها لا تستأذن وهي في حال يتمها، ولكنه باعتبار ما كان لها من اليتم، وإنما يكون ذلك بعد البلوغ، فبعد بلوغها تستأمر وتستأذن، ولا يلزم أن تنطق، بل يكفي أن تصمت، وعبر عنها باليتم باعتبار ما كان، وهو ما قبل البلوغ؛ لأن هذا الوصف كان معها، فعوملت بعد بلوغها معاملة ما كان قبل البلوغ من إطلاق اليتم عليها.
وهذا نظير قول الله عز وجل: {وَآتُوا الْيَتَامَى أَمْوَالَهُمْ} [النساء: ٢]، ومعلوم أن اليتيم لا يعطى ماله إلا بعد أن يبلغ ويرشد، ولهذا يقول الله عز وجل: {وَابْتَلُوا الْيَتَامَى حَتَّى إِذَا بَلَغُوا النِّكَاحَ فَإِنْ آنَسْتُمْ مِنْهُمْ رُشْدًا فَادْفَعُوا إِلَيْهِمْ أَمْوَالَهُمْ} [النساء: ٦]، ومعناه أنه بعد البلوغ، ولكنه أطلق اليتم باعتبار ما كان لا باعتبار الحال، أي أنه كان يتيماً فيما مضى فاستعمل معه هذا الوصف بعد البلوغ.
قوله: [(تستأمر اليتيمة في نفسها فإن سكتت فهو إذنها)].
هذا يدل على أن سكوت الأبكار إذن منهن، وأنه لا يلزم النطق، وهذا فيه -كما أشرت- أن الاستئمار يطلق أيضاً في حق من لا يلزمه النطق.
قوله: [(وإن أبت فلا جواز عليها)].
يعني: لا تجبر على الزواج، فما دام أنها رفضت وأنها لم توافق وامتنعت عن الزواج بمن عرض عليها فإنه لا جواز عليها، فلا يجوز أن تجبر على تزويجها.

Preparing for translation with formatting guidelines
Now that I have the full file with Arabic verses, I need to ensure that the Arabic script is removed from the Qur'anic quotations and references. I'll provide translations with verse numbers instead. For example, translate {وآتوا اليتامى أموالهم} to "And give the orphans their property" (Quran 4:2). I'll handle other cases similarly and replace Arabic-Indicating digits.

Handling transliteration of names
For explanatory lines like "هو أحمد بن محمد بن ثابت المروزي، وهو ابن شبويه ...", I’ll use non-diacritic transliteration for names outside the chain. So "Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Thabit al-Marwazi" will be treated without diacritics, but for technical terms like "Ibn Majah" I'll follow standard Latin script. The chain may have ALA-LC diacritics.

Meticulous Transliteration of Names
For names like "Aḥmad ibn Thābit al-Marwazī" and "ʿAlī ibn Ḥusayn ibn Wāqid", I'll use ALA-LC transliteration as specified, making sure the ʿ and ḥ are included where applicable. For "Yazīd al-Naḥwī", we'll retain the ī vowel in Yazīd, also using Naḥwī for "النحوي".Similarly, for ʿIkrimah and Ibn ʿAbbās, ALA-LC will use "ʿ".

Translating Chain with Diacritics
For P6847, the chain inside the brackets should be translated by maintaining transliteration with diacritics for the names: "Aḥmad ibn Shabawayh al-Marwazī", "ʿAbd Allāh ibn ʿUthmān", "ʿĪsā ibn ʿUbayd", "ʿUbayd Allāh", and "al-Ḍaḥḥāk". The rest of the phrase, such as "bi-ma'nahu, qāla: fa-wa'aza allahu dhalik", will be translated into English except for the names.

Translating and Handling Explanations
In this translation, I’ll carefully include transliteration for names, ensuring the correct diacritics: "ʿAbd Allāh ibn ʿUthmān", "ʿĪsā ibn ʿUbayd", "ʿUbayd Allāh", "ʿUmar", and "al-Ḍaḥḥāk". For "mawla" of ʿUmar, I’ll keep "freedman" since it’s more fitting in this context. For the Quran verse, I'll include the meaning, without the verse number, to stay consistent.

Translating Hadith and Technical Terms
For translating the hadiths, I’ll ensure proper phrasing like, “as he ﷺ said” when needed. I’ll avoid using transliterations for technical terms like "isti'mar" or "thayyib," sticking to English translations like "consultation" for clarity. For the hadith about the ruler, I’ll use "ruler (the authority)" for context.

Translating Chapter Titles and Narrator Names
For the chapter title "[باب في الاستئمار.]", I'll translate as "[Chapter: Regarding consultation (seeking a woman's decision)]" with no transliteration. In the hadith chain, I’ll transliterate names like Muslim ibn Ibrāhīm, Abān, and others as needed. "May Allah be pleased with him" will follow Abū Hurayrah in the chain.

Translating Names and Commentary
When transliterating "Ibn Zurayʿ," I will include the ʿ and use "Zurayʿ" as required. For "Ḥammād," I'll include “ḥ” and double the "m" in transliteration. I’ll translate terms like "المعنى" to "the meaning (is the same)" but only within the context, no excessive corrections on textual typos.

Deciding on transliteration for redundancy and chains
For "Ḥammād ibn ibn Salamah", I'll treat the double "bin" as a typo and stick with the intended translation: “Ḥammād ibn Salamah ibn Dīnār.” This seems accurate and typical, respecting the instruction to stay literal while interpreting errors. For complex chains, I’ll keep transliterations precise with diacritics, ensuring clarity.

Translating narrator names and citing files properly
For narration chains, I'll transliterate names in brackets (e.g., Abu 'Amr Dhakwan, Aisha) as part of the chain, crucial for accuracy. I'll also ensure "Allah" is used consistently. For citations, I'll follow format guidelines, using a plain-text citation with relevant line ranges after the translation, without special characters.

Translating hadith isnad and citations
I need to translate each section of the isnad accurately, maintaining the correct formulary. For example, for "Aḥmad ibn Thābit al-Marwazī," I’ll explain key terms like "thiqah" (trustworthy) and include references such as "Abu Dawud reported from him." I’ll also be adding citations after key segments, but I’ll ensure these follow the user's request for plain-text without markdown.

Translating and clarifying isndad and rulings
I won’t leave any Arabic words untranslated unless they’re essential to meaning. I’ll carefully phrase the hadith with appropriate context, such as explaining “admonished” as part of a divine prohibition. I’ll also break down biographical details for narrators and clarify key marriage rulings, like guardianship and contracts, ensuring accuracy.

Translating and clarifying rulings and explanations
I’m working through translating rulings related to marriage contracts, guardianship, and consultation. It’s important to explain terms like "obstruction" and "thayyib," along with biographical notes on the narrators, without oversimplifying the technical details of the text. I’ll also pay attention to how parentheses and brackets affect the translation.

Clarifying translation and transliteration requirements
The user wants a plain text translation of Arabic text, with IDs like P6801 intact. Only narration chain names should have ALA-LC transliteration with diacritics (e.g., P6824's isnad). Names outside the isnad, like in jarh wa ta'dil, shouldn't be transliterated. It's about keeping narration chain names clear.

Translating Arabic narration and non-narration elements
I should transliterate the names of narrators in the chain (e.g., Musaddad, ʿAbd al-Wāḥid ibn Ziyād) and translate the rest. For Quranic verses and Arabic formulas, I’ll translate them into English, like "In the name of Allah..." and "All praise is for Allah, Lord of the worlds." No Arabic script except ﷺ.

Translating Quranic verses and headings
I’ll translate the verses accurately, such as from an-Nazi’at 46 and al-Ahqaf 35, ensuring faithfulness to the original text. For headings like "الأسئلة", I’ll translate them without using uppercase. I’ll also translate phrases like "رحمه الله تعالى" as "may Allah, Exalted is He, have mercy on him" and include the website citation they requested.

Handling citation formatting and translation details
The user wants plain text with no markdown, but they do require citations with special tokens. I’ll include citations at the end and ensure no Arabic characters except ﷺ. Book titles like "تحفة الأشراف" and "تهذيب التهذيب" should be translated into English. I'll make sure to transliterate proper names where necessary.

Translating verses, titles, and terminology
The user asked for translations of chapter headings, poetry, and verses, but did not specify book titles. For book titles, we can translate or transliterate, using Latin letters and avoiding Arabic. For narration chains, I’ll use ALA-LC for the narrators only, and translate terms literally, like “Shaykh al-Islām” or "the pre-Islamic period." I should keep the names in transliteration.

Translating names and titles for narration chains
For narration chains, I'll follow ALA-LC transliteration for names, like "Muḥammad ibn Kathīr" and "Sufyān." I'll also translate Arabic phrases like "رسول الله ﷺ" as “the Messenger of Allah ﷺ,” and "رضي الله عنه" as "may Allah be pleased with him." I'll keep the segment IDs like "P6801" as-is and translate accordingly.

P6802 - الأسئلة

P6803 - اختباء جابر رضي الله عنه لرؤية من أراد خطبتها هل هو في زواجه الأول
في الحديث أن جابراً كان يختبئ ليرى التي يريد الزواج بها، فهل هي التي سأله النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم عنها عندما قال: (تزوجت؟ قال: نعم، قال: بكراً أم ثيباً؟ قال: ثيباً يا رسول الله!)، أم أنها قصة زواج آخر لـ جابر؟

P6803a - الجواب
ليس هناك شيء يدل على أنها هي، فيمكن أن تكون هي أو غيرها.

P6804 - ما ينظر إليه من بدن المخطوبة

P6804a - السؤال
ما هو الذي ينظر إليه من المخطوبة؟ وهل يجوز النظر إلى غير الوجه والكفين؟

P6804b - الجواب
ينظر إلى الكفين والوجه فقط ولا يزيد على ذلك، وهناك خلاف، فبعض العلماء يقول: ينظر إلى شعرها، وبعضهم يرى النظر إلى أكثر من ذلك، وهو المنقول عن ابن حزم.

P6805 - حكم استئذان أبناء عم المرأة عند قصد نكاحها

P6805a - السؤال
عند بعض القبائل أن من أراد أن يتزوج امرأة فيجب عليه أن يستأذن أبناء عمومتها، فما حكم هذا؟

P6805b - الجواب
هذا من أمور الجاهلية، فأبناء عمومتها لا يملكونها، وليس لهم أن يمنعوها من الزواج ممن تريد.

P6806 - حكم كتابة بعض الآيات في إناء لتسقى بمائه من تعسرت ولادتها

P6806a - السؤال
قال شيخ الإسلام ابن 
Printing specified text range from file
print(txt[2000:6000])

تيمية رحمه الله تعالى: ويجوز أن يكتب للمصاب وغيره من المرضى شيء من كتاب الله وذكره بالمداد المباح، ويغسل ويسقى كما نص على ذلك أحمد وغيره، قال عبد الله ابن الإمام أحمد: قرأت على أبي: حدثنا يعلى بن عبيد حدثنا سفيان عن محمد بن أبي ليلى عن الحكم عن سعيد بن جبير عن ابن عباس رضي الله عنهما قال: إذا عسر على المرأة ولادتها فليكتب: (باسم الله، لا إله إلا الله الحليم الكريم، سبحان الله رب العرش العظيم، {الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ} [الفاتحة: ٢]، {كَأَنَّهُمْ يَوْمَ يَرَوْنَهَا لَمْ يَلْبَثُوا إِلَّا عَشِيَّةً أَوْ ضُحَاهَا} [النازعات: ٤٦]، {كَأَنَّهُمْ يَوْمَ يَرَوْنَ مَا يُوعَدُونَ لَمْ يَلْبَثُوا إِلَّا سَاعَةً مِنْ نَهَارٍ بَلاغٌ فَهَلْ يُهْلَكُ إِلَّا الْقَوْمُ الْفَاسِقُونَ} [الأحقاف: ٣٥].
قال أبي: حدثنا أسود بن عامر بإسناده بمعناه، وقال: يكتب في إناء نظيف فيسقى.
قال أبي: وزاد فيه وكيع: فتسقى، وينضح ما دون سرتها.
قال عبد الله: رأيت أبي يكتب للمرأة في إجان أو شيء نظيف إلى آخره.
نقل هذا الكلام شيخ الإسلام ابن تيمية في (مجموع الفتاوى).
فعلم مما نقله أنه يكتب للمرأة في إناء نظيف فتسقى وينضح به ما دون سرتها؛ لأجل تيسير الولادة، ونقله عن أحمد، فهل يصح هذا الفعل؟

P6806b - الجواب
هذا الإسناد غير صحيح عن ابن عباس ما دام أن فيه محمد بن أبي ليلى، وأما ما جاء عن بعض السلف كما ذكر ابن تيمية وكذلك ابن القيم في كتاب (زاد المعاد) في كتابة آيات في مناسبات وفي أحوال متعددة فيبدو -والله أعلم- أن ترك ذلك هو الأولى؛ لأنه لا دليل عليه.

P6807 - مراد الحافظ ابن حجر باشتراطه الصحة أو الحسن فيما نقله من أمهات المسانيد والجوامع وغيرها في الفتح

P6807a - السؤال
قال الحافظ رحمه الله تعالى في مقدمة (هدي الساري): ثم أستخرج ثانياً ما يتعلق به غرض صحيح في ذلك الحديث من الفوائد المتنية والإسنادية من تتمات وزيادات، وكشف غامض، وتصريح مدلس بسماع، ومتابعة سامع من شيخ اختلط قبل ذلك، منتزعاً كل ذلك من أمهات المسانيد والجوامع والمستخرجات والأجزاء والفوائد بشرط الصحة أو الحسن فيما أورده من ذلك.
اهـ.
فما مراد الحافظ بقوله: بشرط الصحة أو الحسن، فهل كل ما أورده الحافظ في الفتح يحكم عليه بهذا الحكم كما هو مشتهر بين طلبة العلم أم أن الحكم مقتصر على ما فصله رحمه الله من فوائد وتتمات وزيادات متعلقة بالحديث المشروح والمتكلم عليه؟

P6807b - الجواب
هذا الكلام يفهم منه أنه إذا تكلم عليه بضعف أو بصحة فقد حصل المقصود بكلامه المحدد، ولكنه إذا سكت عنه ولم يذكر شيئاً فمقتضى هذا الكلام أنه يكون صحيحاً أو حسناً على حسب كلامه رحمه الله تعالى.

P6808 - حكم ترك المسنون لتأليف القلوب

P6808a - السؤال
هل يجوز ترك المسنون لمصلحة الدعوة، ولتأليف القلوب؟

P6808b - الجواب
تأليف القلوب يكون باتباع السنة والدعوة إليها، وليس بترك السنن من أجل أن يحصَّل شيئاً وقد لا يحصله، فيكون بذلك قد خسر هذا وهذا.

P6809 - حكم السلام على المرأة حال الحاجة إلى تكليمها

P6809a - السؤال
الرجل قد يضطر إلى أن يتكلم مع المرأة الشابة لأمر من الأمور من وراء حجاب، فهل يبدأ الحديث بالسلام ويختمه بالسلام؟

P6809b - الجواب
بداية الكلام هو السلام، لكن الكلام مع الشابة أو مع غير الشابة إنما يكون في حدود المقصود والمطلوب، مثل أن يتصل بالهاتف فترد امرأة، فأولاً يسلم، ثم يسأل عن الشخص هل هو موجود أو غير موجود؟ وينتهي عند هذا الحد، ولا يكون هناك استرسال في الكلام أخذاً وعطاءً.

P6810 - توضيح القاعدة: (لا إنكار في مسائل الخلاف)

P6810a - السؤال
ما قولكم فيمن يقول بأنه لا إنكار في مسألة الغناء بالموسيقى، وكذلك مسألة التمثيل بحجة أن اختلاف الأمة رحمة وبالقاعدة الفقهية: لا إنكار في مسائل الخلاف؟

P6810b - الجواب
ليس كل خلاف يكون معتبراً، والمعول عليه هي الأدلة، وإذا اتضح الدليل وكان موجوداً فلا تجوز مخالفته، ولا يجوز ترك الإنكار من أجل أن هناك من خالف في ذلك؛ لأن المعتبر هو ثبوت الدليل وظهور الحق ولو قال بخلافه من قال، فإنه لا يترك الحق من أجل أن فيه خلافاً، ولو كان الأمر أن كل شيء فيه خلاف لا يتكلم فيه لما كان هناك بيان للحق، بل المسائل الخلافية منها ما يكون القول الآخر ليس عليه دليل، أو هو اجتهاد في مقابل نص، أو قياس في مقابل نص واضح جلي، فلابد من الإيضاح والبيان.

P6811 - حكم ضرب الدف في الأعراس للرجال

P6811a - السؤال
هل يجوز ضرب الدفوف في حفل الزواج للرجال؟

P6811b - الجواب
لا يجوز ذلك للرجال، وإنما يجوز للنساء فقط؛ لأنه ورد في حق النساء ولم يرد في حق الرجال.

P6812 - حكم الولائم قبل العرس

P6812a - السؤال
ما يفعله بعض الناس من الولائم قبل النكاح مما يسمى الشَّبْكة وغيرها هل يعتبر من الإسراف؟

ما يفعله بعض الناس من الولائم قبل النكاح مما يسمى الشَّبْكة وغيرها هل يعتبر من الإسراف؟

P6812b - الجواب
لا شك أنها من التكلف ومن الأشياء التي تثقل كاهل الزوج، وعدم فعل هذه الأشياء والاكتفاء بوليمة واحدة مع عدم المبالغة فيها هو الذي ينبغي.

P6814b - الجواب
معناه أن وجوده بينهم أمنة لهم من الخلاف الذي حصل بعد وفاته صلى الله عليه وسلم، والحديث صحيح ثابت عن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم.

P6815 - الجواب عن حديث تمتع بعض الصحابة إلى عهد عمر رضي الله عنه

P6815a - السؤال
جاء في الحديث: (كنا نستمتع بالقبضة من التمر والدقيق الأيام على عهد النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم وأبي بكر حتى نهى عنه عمر)، فما الجواب عن هذا الحديث؛ إذ إنه يدل على أن المتعة تأخر النهي عنها؟

P6815b - الجواب
قال ابن القيم في (زاد المعاد في هدي خير العباد رحمه الله تعالى: فإن قيل: فما تصنعون بما رواه مسلم في صحيحه عن جابر بن عبد الله رضي الله عنهما أنه قال: كنا نستمتع بالقبضة من التمر والدقيق الأيام على عهد رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم وأبي بكر رضي الله عنه حتى نهى عنها عمر رضي الله عنه في شأن عمرو بن حريث، وفيما ثبت عن عمر أنه قال: متعتان كانتا على عهد رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم أنا أنهى عنهما: متعة النساء، ومتعة الحج.
قيل: الناس في هذا طائفتان: طائفة تقول: إن عمر هو الذي حرمها ونهى عنها، وقد أمر رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم باتباع ما سنه الخلفاء الراشدون، ولم تر هذه الطائفة تصحيح حديث سبرة بن معبد في تحريم المتعة عام الفتح، فإنه من رواية عبد الملك بن الربيع بن سبرة عن أبيه عن جده، وقد تكلم فيه ابن معين، ولم ير البخاري إخراج حديثه في صحيحه مع شدة الحاجة إليه، وكونه أصلاً من أصول الإسلام، ولو صح عنده لم يصبر عن إخراجه والاحتجاج به.
قالوا: ولو صح حديث سبرة لم يخف على ابن مسعود رضي الله عنه حتى يروي أنهم فعلوها ويحتج بالآية، وأيضاً ولو صح لم يقل عمر: إنها كانت على عهد رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم وأنا أنهى عنها وأعاقب عليها، بل كان يقول: إنه صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم حرمها ونهى عنها، قالوا: ولو صح لم تفعل على عهد الصديق وهو عهد خلافة النبوة حقاً.
والطائفة الثانية رأت صحة حديث سبرة، ولو لم يصح فقد صح حديث علي رضي الله عنه أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم حرم متعة النساء، فوجب حمل حديث جابر على أن الذي أخبر عنها بفعلها لم يبلغه التحريم، ولم يكن قد اشتهر حتى كان زمن عمر رضي الله عنه، فلما وقع فيها النزاع ظهر تحريمها واشتهر، وبهذا تأتلف الأحاديث الواردة فيها، وبالله التوفيق.
وهذا يوضح المقصود، وأنه يبلغهم، وبعد ذلك اشتهر وظهر في عهد عمر رضي الله عنه وأرضاه، ويشبه هذا حديث عائشة رضي الله تعالى عنها: (كان فيما أنزل من القرآن عشر رضعات معلومات يحرمن، فنسخن بخمس معلومات، فتوفي رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم وهن فيما يقرأ من القرآن) مع أنهن منسوخة، ولكن لقرب العهد كان بعض الناس بعد وفاة الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم يقرءونها ولم يعلموا بالنسخ، فهذا من هذا القبيل كما قال ابن القيم.

P6816 - حكم اشتراط الولي على الزوج ترك الزواج على موليته

P6816a - السؤال
هل لولي المرأة أن يشترط في العقد ألا يتزوج الزوج على ابنته؟

P6816b - الجواب
لا بأس بذلك؛ لأنه يريد أن بنته لا تضار ولا يحصل لها يضرها، والإنسان الذي لا يريد هذا الشيء عليه أن يبحث عن غيرها، والأمر فيه سعة، ولكن المحذور هو أن تكون المرأة موجودة ثم تأتي امرأة وتشترط طلاق الموجودة التي حصل لها رزق وخير، وأما ما ذكر في السؤال فلا بأس به.

P6817 - حكم منع الخاطب من النظر إلى مخطوبته

P6817a - السؤال
عندنا عادة وهي أننا لا نسمح للخاطب أن ينظر إلى المخطوبة، وإذا طلب نمنعه، فهل علينا شيء من الإثم؟

P6817b - الجواب
حصول الإثم لا أعلم به، والنظر ليس بلازم، وقول النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم: (إن استطعت أن تنظر) يدل على أنه يمكن أن يكون زواج بدون نظر.

P6818 - كلمة توجيهية لطلبة العلم في أيام الإجازة

P6818a - السؤال
نظراً لانتهاء الدراسة لهذا العام وكون كل الطلبة يرجعون إلى بلدانهم نرجو توجيهكم للطلبة في الدعوة إلى الله جل وعلا؟

P6818b - الجواب
إن هذه الإجازة فرصة على الإنسان أن يغتنمها ويستفيد منها، وألا تضيع عليه بدون فائدة، وذلك بأن يفعل ما يمكنه فعله مما يعود عليه بالخير ومما يعود على غيره بالخير، وذلك بالقراءة والمطالعة وقراءة بعض الكتب النافعة المفيدة، أو القيام بالدعوة إلى الله عز وجل والدعوة إلى الخير، أو تدريس بعض الناس الذين هم بحاجة إلى تدريسه، فيعلمهم أمور دينهم ويفقههم فيها، وهذا من الدعوة إلى الله عز وجل؛ لأن الدعوة إلى الله تكون بالتعليم وتكون بالتذكير، وتكون لأناس يعلمهم ولأناس يذكرهم، فكل ذلك من الدعوة إلى الله عز وجل، فالمهم في الأمر أن الإنسان يستفيد من الإجازة، وألا يضيع الفرصة على نفسه دون أن يستغلها فيما يعود عليه وعلى غيره بالخير.
وإذا كان الإنسان ليس عنده إمكانٌ أن يقوم بالدعوة إلى الله عز وجل وأن يعلم غيره فلا أقل من أن يقرأ بعض الكتب النافعة والمفيدة مثل كتاب (إعلام الموقعين) لـ ابن القيم، وهو كتاب نفيس مشتمل على علم عظيم، وعلى ذكر قواعد في الشريعة، وعلى حكم الأحكام الشرعية، وهو مشتمل على أصول وعلى فروع، وكذلك أيضاً كتاب (زاد المعاد في هدي خير العباد)، فهو كتاب عظيم، فإذا قرأ مثل هذه الكتب وخرج من الإجازة وقد قرأ مثل هذه الكتب فإنه يكون قد خرج بربح وفائدة، وإذا لم يوطن نفسه على أن يعمل مثل هذا العمل فإن الإجازة ستنتهي ولم يربح فيها شيئاً ولم يحصَّل فيها طائلاً؛ لأنه فوت الفرصة على نفسه، ولكنه إذا عقد العزم من أول الأمر على أن يجتهد ويستفيد من العطلة فإنه سيحصل وسيستفيد دون أن تضيع عليه سدىً بلا فائدة، هذه نصيحة مختصرة أحب أن أقولها في هذه المناسبة.

P6819 - الموقف من كتاب الأساس في التفسير ومؤلفه

P6819a - السؤال
ما رأيكم في كتاب الأساس في التفسير لـ سعيد حوى، وما رأيكم في مؤلفه؟

P6819b - الجواب
لا أعرف الكتاب، لكن أعرف أن صاحب الكتاب مخلط، وأنه لا يصلح أن يقرأ شيء من كتبه لما فيها من التخليط، وعلى الإنسان أن يقرأ الكتب المأمونة والكتب النافعة التي يخرج منها بفائدة، مثل الكتابين اللذين أشرت إليهما: كتاب (إعلام الموقعين) و (زاد المعاد)، ومثل تفسير الشيخ ابن سعدي، فالإنسان إذا أراد أن يقرأ تفسيراً مأموناً وتفسيراً واضحاً يمكنه أن يقرأه ويكمله وهو بعبارات واضحة، جلية فعليه بتفسير الشيخ عبد الرحمن بن سعدي رحمه الله، فهو تفسير قيم وعظيم يصلح للعامة والخاصة؛ لأنه بعبارات واضحة يفهمها الخاص والعام، فليس فيه: (قيل كذا وقيل كذا وقيل كذا)، فهذه أشياء قد تشوش على العامة، فإن عباراته واضحة جلية، فهو يحلل الآيات ويبين معانيها بعبارات واضحة جلية مفهومة، فعلى القارئ أن يقرأ لأناس عندهم سلامة من التخليط، ويكونون أهل علم وليسوا أهل مناهج جديدة منحرفة عن الجادة.

P6820 - ما يصنع بعد زواج الشغار مع الجهل

P6820a - السؤال
إذا تزوج اثنان عن طريق الشغار مع الجهل بالحكم فهل يفرق بينهما؟

P6820b - الجواب
إذا حصل التراضي والوفاق فإن العقد يجدد.

P6821 - وقت النظر إلى المخطوبة

P6821a - السؤال
هل النظر إلى المخطوبة يكون قبل الخطبة أم بعدها؟

P6821b - الجواب
قال بعض أهل العلم: إنه يكون قبل الخطبة، فإذا عزم على أن يخطبها فإنه ينظر إليها قبل أن يخطبها، وقالوا: إنه لو خطبها ثم رآها بعد ذلك فقد لا يرغب فيها، وهذا لا يكون إلا عن طريق الاختباء، وأما عن طريق الطلب فلا سبيل إلى رؤيتها إلا أن يكون خاطباً.

P6822 - شرح سنن أبي داود [٢٤٠]
الزواج من أعظم الأمور التي ضبطها الإسلام، وجعلها حصناً لحفظ الأعراض والحد من انتشار الفواحش، وقد اشترط الشرع في الزواج أن يصدر من ولي المرأة، وأبطل النكاح إذا كان بغير إذن الولي.

P6823 - الولاية في النكاح

P6824 - شرح حديث (أيما امرأة نكحت بغير إذن مواليها فنكاحها باطل)
قال المصنف رحمه الله تعالى: [باب في الولي.
حدثنا محمد بن كثير أخبرنا سفيان أخبرنا ابن جريج عن سليمان بن موسى عن الزهري عن عروة عن عائشة رضي الله عنها قالت: قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم: (أيما امرأة نكحت بغير إذن مواليها فنكاحها باطل -ثلاث مرات- فإن دخل بها فالمهر لها بما أصاب منها، فإن تشاجروا فالسلطان ولي من لا ولي له)].
يقول الإمام أبو داود السجستاني رحمه الله تعالى: [باب في الولي].
أي: الولي الذي يتولى عقد النكاح للزوج على امرأة، فإنه لابد من وجود ولي لها يتولى ذلك، ولا تتولى هي ذلك بنفسها، ولا يتولاه أجنبي عنها ليس من مواليها إلا بتوكيل من الولي، والولاية في النكاح كانت موجودة في الجاهلية، كما جاء في صحيح البخاري عن عائشة رضي الله عنها أنهم كانوا في الجاهلية يأتي الرجل إلى الرجل فيخطب وليته منه فيزوجها إياه، فكان هذا الحكم الذي هو لزوم الولي في النكاح من الأمور التي كانت في الجاهلية وأقرها الإسلام.

P6825 - الحكمة في اعتبار الولي في النكاح وأدلة اشتراطه في الكتاب والسنة
ومعلوم أن سنة الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم تكون بالقول والفعل والتقرير، وقد جاءت سنة رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم باشتراط الولي كما في الحديث الذي أورده أبو داود وغيره، وجاء ذلك في القرآن الكريم أيضاً، وجاء أيضاً التقرير لهذا الحكم الذي كان في الجاهلية، وأنه من الأحكام التي كانت موجودة وأقرها الإسلام.
وهو شيء محمود؛ لأن في ذلك إبعاد المرأة عن الظهور بالاشتغال بالزواج والحياء يغلب عليهن، فكان أن جاء الكتاب والسنة باشتراط الولي في النكاح، وأنه لابد من ولي للمرأة يعقد النكاح لها على من يتزوجها، وقد جاء في القرآن الكريم ما يدل على ذلك، وذلك في قول الله عز وجل: {فَلا تَعْضُلُوهُنَّ أَنْ يَنكِحْنَ أَزْوَاجَهُنَّ} [البقرة: ٢٣٢]، وهو خطاب للأولياء، فلو كانت المرأة يمكنها أن تعقد لنفسها أو يقوم بذلك أحد من غير أوليائها لما كان هناك حاجة إلى أن ينهى الأولياء عن العضل، حين يعضلونهن أن ينكحن أزواجهن، وذلك أن الآية نزلت في معقل بن يسار رضي الله عنه، وكان له أخت زوجها من قريب لها ثم طلقها، ولما انتهت عدتها جاء يخطبها، فحلف معقل أن لا يزوجها إياه، فبلغ ذلك النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم فنزلت الآية: {فَلا تَعْضُلُوهُنَّ أَنْ يَنكِحْنَ أَزْوَاجَهُنَّ} أي: الذين طلقوهن وانتهت عدتهن.
أما إذا كان طلقها وهي باقية في العدة فالأمر إلى الزوج؛ لأن له حق الرجعة، ولكنه إذا خرجت المرأة من العدة صار خاطباً من الخطاب إن شاءت أن تعود إليه فوليها لا يمنعها من ذلك، وإن شاءت أن لا تقبله ورغبت في شخص آخر سواه فإن لها ذلك.
فهذه الآية الكريمة فيها نهي الأولياء عن العضل، وهو امتناعهم عن أن يزوجوا الأزواج المطلقين إذا رضيت النساء بهؤلاء الأزواج الذين طلقوهن، فيلزم الولي بأن يعقد لها على زوجها الذي طلقها وانتهت عدتها وأراد أن يتزوجها مرة أخرى، فالآية واضحة الدلالة على أن الولاية لازمة؛ لأنها لو لم تكن لازمة لما كان هناك حاجة إلى أن ينهوا، بل هي تتصرف في نفسها لو كان الأمر إليها، وسنة الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم جاء فيها من الأحاديث ما أورده أبو داود في هذا الباب، فقد أورد أحاديث تدل على أنه لابد من الولي في النكاح.
فأورد أولاً حديث أم المؤمنين عائشة رضي الله عنها وأرضاها أن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم قال: [(أيما امرأة نكحت بغير إذن مواليها فنكاحها باطل -ثلاث مرات-)] أي أنه قال: باطل، باطل، باطل.
كرر ذلك للتأكيد، قال: (فإن دخل بها فلها المهر بما أصاب منها، فإن تشاجروا فالسلطان ولي من لا ولي له)].
فقول الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم: (أيما امرأة نكحت بغير إذن مواليها فنكاحها باطل)] يدل على أن الولاية شرط في النكاح، وأن العقد إذا عقد من غير ولي فإنه يكون باطلاً، وكون المرأة تعقد لنفسها أو توكل أحداً يعقد لها وهي التي تتولى ذلك بغير إذن الموالي فإنه يكون باطلاً كما قال ذلك رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم، وهو يدل على العموم، والمعنى أن أي امرأة حصل لها ذلك بغير ولي فإن النكاح يكون باطلاً، ويكون لاغياً كأنه لم يكن؛ لأنه فقد هذا الشرط الذي هو الولي في النكاح.
والمقصود بقوله: [(إذن مواليها)] كونهم يعقدون أو يأذنون لأحد أن يعقد، أي: إما أن يعقد الولي بنفسه أو يأذن لأحد أن يعقد نيابة عنه.
فالمقصود به أن النكاح لا يصح إذا لم يكن من ولي أو وكيل لولي، وليس المقصود به أن المرأة لها أن تزوج نفسها بإذن وليها؛ لأنها ليست لها الولاية في عقد الزواج لنفسها.
والولي هو الذي يكون من عصبتها الأولى فالأولى، أي: الأب، ثم الجد، ثم الابن، ثم ابن الابن، ثم الأخ الشقيق، ثم الأخ لأب، ثم ابن الأخ الشقيق، ثم ابن الأخ لأب، ثم العم الشقيق، ثم العم لأب، ثم ابن العم الشقيق، ثم ابن العم لأب، وهكذا على حسب الترتيب، وغير العصبة لا يكونون أولياء، لا ذوو الأرحام ولا الذين يرثون بالفرض كالإخوة لأم.
ولابد في الولي الذي يتولى العقد من البلوغ، ويقدم الأصول على غيرهم، ويقدم الفروع على الحواشي، ولو عقد الولي الأدنى مع وجود الأعلى صح إذا أقره، فإذا تنازل من له الحق لمن هو دونه صح العقد.

P6826 - إبطال العقد الخالي عن الولي
ثم قال: [(فإن دخل بها)] يعني: إن دخل عليها بهذا العقد الذي هو غير صحيح [(فلها المهر بما أصاب منها)] يعني: هذا الذي دفعه لها مهراً لا يرجع إليه ما دام أنه أصابها وجامعها؛ لأن لها ذلك بما استحل من فرجها.
وإذا اشتجر الأولياء -بمعنى أنهم اختلفوا أو عضلوا- فإن الولاية تنتقل إلى السلطان [(فالسلطان ولي من لا ولي له)]، وهذا يدلنا -أيضاً- على أن المرأة لا حق لها في عقد النكاح؛ إذ جعل الشرع الحق في ذلك للأولياء، ثم تنتقل للسلطان ولا تنتقل إليها، فالأمر يرجع إلى الأولياء، ثم إن كانوا لا يوجدون أو يوجدون ولكنهم عاضلون وممتنعون من تحقيق رغبتها وتزويجها بمن هو أهل للزواج منها فإن ذلك الأمر ينتقل إلى السلطان، لقوله: [(فإن اشتجروا فالسلطان ولي من لا ولي له)].
Translating sections and adjusting references
For sections P6801 to P6826, I'll translate without markdown, ensuring Arabic characters are removed. Quran verse citations like [البقرة: ٢٣٢] will be converted to "al-Baqarah: 232" with Arabic-Indic digits changed to Western numerals. I'll apply ALA-LC for surah names and transliterate companion names like Maʿqil ibn Yasār, even though it's outside the chain.

Clarifying transliteration rules
It seems the instructions are clear: I should use ALA-LC transliteration only for the names of narrators within the isnad. For names outside the isnad, like Ibn Taymiyyah or al-Albani, I can use conventional English spellings without diacritics. No Arabic characters should be used throughout.

Clarifying diacritic usage
To avoid violating the rule, I'll restrict ALA-LC diacritics to narrators' names within the isnad. For names outside the chain, like Ibn Taymiyyah and al-Albani, I’ll use plain spellings without diacritics. As for the apostrophe for ʿ, it's part of the transliteration but not a diacritic, so I’ll use it sparingly.

Clarifying transliteration rules
I’ll use ALA-LC transliteration for narrators' names in the isnad, including special characters like ḥ and ʿ. For other names, such as Ibn Taymiyyah or Albani, I’ll stick to plain Latin characters with an apostrophe or hyphen. Technical terms like "thiqa" or "mudallis" can be transliterated without diacritics.

Compiling translation rules and considerations
For terms like "shighar marriage" and "shabka" (bridal jewelry), I’ll keep transliteration simple without diacritics. "Burdens the husband" will be used for "كاهل الزوج." When translating hadith, I must ensure both the text and context (like mut'ah marriage) are accurately captured. I’ll avoid using "God" as a translation for Allah unless in specific contexts like "ilah." I’ll translate "لا إله إلا الله" as "There is no deity but Allah." I also must ensure no Arabic characters or citations in the text—just plain translation with segments and IDs intact.

Keeping segment structure and transliteration consistent
For each segment, I should preserve both the ID and the chain of narration, such as:

P6801 - Biographies of the men in the chain of narration of the hadith: (When one of you proposes to a woman, if he is able to look at what will motivate him to marry her, let him do so)

When mentioning narrators, I’ll use plain transliterations without diacritics like "Muḥammad ibn Isḥāq" and keep parentheses or brackets where they appear. I’ll use "Tuhfat al-Ashraf" and "Tahdhib" without diacritics, and translate "al-Hafiz" as Ibn Hajar.

Clarifying usage of ALA-LC for narrators
For names within the chain of narration, like in P6801, P6806a, or P6824, we'll use ALA-LC transliteration, including diacritics. For narrators like "Waqid ibn 'Amr" who are mentioned but not in-chain, I’ll skip ALA-LC. I’ll keep non-chain names plain, like “Muslim” or “Abu Dawud.”

Transliteration plan for narrators and companions
For names in the chain of narration, I’ll stick to ALA-LC, including diacritics, such as for "Muḥammad," "Musaddad," and "ʿAbd al-Wāḥid ibn Ziyād." I'll also apply the same for ʿĀʾishah in the chain, but for companions like “Ibn Mas'ud” or “Abu Bakr,” I’ll leave them plain without diacritics.

Transliteration choices and translation considerations
For narrators in the chains (e.g., Yaʿlā ibn ʿUbayd, Sufyān, Muḥammad ibn Abī Laylā), I’ll apply ALA-LC with diacritics, using long vowels like ā (e.g., Sufyān, Sulaymān, Mūsā). For other names like ʿĀʾishah, ʿAbd al-Raḥmān, I’ll also ensure proper use of macrons and diacritics. For hadith translation, I’ll preserve the original text inside parentheses and translate the other words.

Translating Islamic text and hadith with guidance
For P6824 and P6825, "قال المصنف رحمه الله تعالى:" translates as "The compiler, may Allah Most High have mercy on him, said:". When showing chapter headings like "باب في الولي", I’ll translate as “Chapter on the guardian” without capitalizing. For the Quran verses, I’ll provide translations like: "So do not prevent them from marrying their husbands" [al-Baqarah: 232] without Arabic. Names like "mawali" will be translated as "guardians (mawālī)" without diacritics.

Translating hadith terminology and ensuring accuracy
For terms like 'asaba', I’ll use the transliteration 'asaba' without diacritics. "السلطان" translates as "the ruler (al-sultan)", keeping it precise. For hadith chain segments, I’ll preserve the use of brackets for clarity. For names like "Musaddad", I’ll follow ALA-LC without diacritics. Ensuring accurate terminology in line with hadith scholarship is essential for the translation. Promptly revising the translation, ensuring no Arabic characters, and being mindful of technical terms such as isnad and matn is key.

Translating hadiths and maintaining details
For the hadith snippet about Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him), I’ll keep the translation precise: "When he said, 'Have you married? He said: Yes. A virgin or previously married?' He said: 'A previously married woman, O Messenger of Allah ﷺ!'" I'll ensure accuracy for terms like ﷺ, 'ijana' (a basin), and use transliterations for Arabic words such as "makhtubah" and "asaba," while preserving technical distinctiveness.

Translating quotes and maintaining clarity
When translating Ibn Hajar's and others' statements, I'll stick to technical terms like "sahih," "hasan," and "musnad" but avoid using Arabic. I’ll also make sure to translate "اهـ" as "end of quote." For the context around "salam," I’ll leave it as is since it’s understood as the technical term used in Islamic discourse for the greeting of peace.

Clarifying hadith about mut'ah and the companions
The hadith about the Prophet ﷺ being a security for his companions relates to his presence being a protection against posthumous division. As for the mut'ah (temporary marriage), two groups interpret the prohibition differently: one argues Umar forbade it after the Prophet ﷺ and Abu Bakr’s era, while the other sees the prohibition as established earlier. Both understandings hinge on the authenticity of specific narrations.

Clarifying stipulations and rulings on marriage matters
The discussion touches on various marriage-related rulings, such as a guardian’s right to stipulate that a husband not marry another wife and the permissibility of a suitor looking at his fiancée. Topics also include certain types of marriages done in ignorance and whether a woman’s marriage requires her guardian’s consent.

Translating rulings on guardianship in marriage
This section discusses the necessity of a guardian in marriage and emphasizes that a woman needs a guardian to conclude a contract, just as was practiced in Jahiliyyah. It also clarifies that marriage must be authorized by the guardian, not undertaken by the woman herself, and addresses various conditions, including the rights of a guardian and the ruler in disputes.

Translating hadith content and contextual terms
translation = r"""P6801 - Biographies of the men in the chain of narration of the hadith: (When one of you proposes to a woman, if he is able to look at what will prompt him to marry her, let him do so)
His statement: [Musaddad narrated to us from ʿAbd al-Wāḥid ibn Ziyād].
ʿAbd al-Wāḥid ibn Ziyād is trustworthy; the compilers of the Six Books narrated from him.
[Muḥammad ibn Isḥāq narrated to us].
Muḥammad ibn Isḥāq has been mentioned previously.
[from Dāwūd ibn Ḥuṣayn].
Dāwūd ibn Ḥuṣayn is trustworthy; the compilers of the Six Books narrated from him.
[from Wāqid ibn ʿAbd al-Raḥmān].
He is Wāqid ibn ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ibn Saʿd ibn Muʿādh, and it says in (Tuhfat al-Ashrāf): what is known is that he is Wāqid ibn ʿAmr ibn Saʿd ibn Muʿādh.
Al-Hafiz said: its men are trustworthy, and Ibn al-Qattan criticized it by way of Wāqid ibn ʿAbd al-Raḥmān, and said: what is known is Wāqid ibn ʿAmr; and in the narration of al-Hakim it is: Wāqid ibn ʿAmr, and likewise in the narration of al-Shafi‘i and Abd al-Razzaq.
And in (Tuhfat al-Ashrāf): thus he said, Wāqid ibn ʿAbd al-Raḥmān, and what is known is Wāqid ibn ʿAmr ibn Saʿd ibn Muʿādh; and the wording of al-Hakim in al-Mustadrak supports it, but al-Mizzi distinguished between the two in his Tahdhib, and he increased the distinction between them and emphasized it, and al-Hafiz also affirmed it in (Tahdhib al-Tahdhib).
This was stated by Shaykh al-Albani.
And Wāqid ibn ʿAmr ibn Saʿd ibn Muʿādh is trustworthy; Muslim, Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi, and al-Nasa’i narrated from him.
[from Jābir ibn ʿAbd Allāh, may Allah Most High be pleased with them both] has been mentioned previously.

P6802 - Questions

P6803 - Jābir, may Allah be pleased with him, hiding in order to see the woman he intended to propose to: was that in his first marriage?
In the hadith, Jābir was hiding to see the one he wanted to marry; so is she the one the Prophet ﷺ asked him about when he said: (Have you married? He said: Yes. He said: A virgin or a previously married woman? He said: A previously married woman, O Messenger of Allah ﷺ!), or is it the story of another marriage of Jābir?

P6803a - The answer
There is nothing indicating that she was the same woman, so it could have been her or someone else.

P6804 - What may be looked at of the body of the woman being proposed to

P6804a - The question
What is it that may be looked at of the woman being proposed to? Is it permissible to look at other than the face and the two hands?

P6804b - The answer
He looks only at the two hands and the face, and he does not go beyond that. There is disagreement: some scholars say he may look at her hair, and some hold that looking at more than that is permissible, and this is what is transmitted from Ibn Hazm.

P6805 - Ruling on seeking permission from a woman’s paternal cousins when intending to marry her

P6805a - The question
Among some tribes, whoever intends to marry a woman must seek permission from her paternal cousins; what is the ruling on this?

P6805b - The answer
This is from the matters of al-Jahiliyyah; her paternal cousins do not own her, and they have no right to prevent her from marrying whom she wants.

P6806 - Ruling on writing some verses in a vessel so that the one whose childbirth is difficult may be given its water to drink

P6806a - The question
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah, may Allah Most High have mercy on him, said: It is permissible to write, for the afflicted person and others among the sick, something from the Book of Allah and His remembrance with permissible ink, and it is washed and drunk, as Ahmad and others stated. Abdullah, the son of Imam Ahmad, said: I read to my father: Yaʿlā ibn ʿUbayd narrated to us; Sufyān narrated to us; from Muḥammad ibn Abī Laylā; from al-Ḥakam; from Saʿīd ibn Jubayr; from Ibn ʿAbbās, may Allah be pleased with them both, who said: If childbirth becomes difficult for a woman, then let him write: (In the name of Allah. There is no deity but Allah, the Forbearing, the Generous. Glory be to Allah, Lord of the Magnificent Throne. All praise is for Allah, Lord of the worlds [al-Fātiḥah: 2]. As if, on the day they see it, they had not remained except an evening or its forenoon [al-Nāziʿāt: 46]. As if, on the day they see what they are promised, they had not remained except an hour of a day. A conveyance, so shall any be destroyed except the defiantly disobedient people [al-Aḥqāf: 35].)
My father said: Aswad ibn ʿĀmir narrated to us, with his isnad, with its meaning; and he said: It is written in a clean vessel and then she is given to drink.
My father said: And Wakīʿ added to it: then she is given to drink, and that which is below her navel is sprinkled.
Abdullah said: I saw my father write for a woman in an ijānah, or something clean, and so on to the end.
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah نقل this statement in (Majmuʿ al-Fatāwā).
So it is understood from what he نقل that it is written for a woman in a clean vessel, then she is given to drink and that which is below her navel is sprinkled with it, in order to facilitate childbirth; and he نقل it from Ahmad. So is this act sound?

P6806b - The answer
This isnad is not authentic from Ibn Abbas, so long as it contains Muhammad ibn Abi Layla. As for what is reported from some of the salaf, as Ibn Taymiyyah mentioned, and likewise Ibn al-Qayyim in the book (Zad al-Maʿad), regarding writing verses on occasions and in various situations, then it appears—and Allah knows best—that leaving that is better, because there is no evidence for it.

P6807 - What al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar meant by his stipulating soundness or hasan for what he نقل from the principal musnads, jawamiʿ, and others in al-Fath

P6807a - The question
Al-Hafiz, may Allah Most High have mercy on him, said in the introduction to (Hady al-Sari): “Then I extract, secondly, what relates to that hadith, for a valid purpose, of the benefits of the text and the chain: of completions and additions, uncovering an obscurity, an explicit statement by a mudallis of having heard, and a corroboration by one who heard from a shaykh who had mixed up before that, extracting all of that from the principal musnads, jawamiʿ, mustakhraj works, ajzaʾ, and fawaʾid, on the condition of soundness or hasan regarding what I mention thereof.”
End of quote.
So what did al-Hafiz mean by his statement: “on the condition of soundness or hasan”? Is everything al-Hafiz brought in al-Fath judged by this ruling, as is common among students of knowledge, or is the ruling restricted to what he detailed, may Allah have mercy on him, of benefits, completions, and additions related to the hadith being explained and discussed?

P6807b - The answer
This statement is understood to mean that if he speaks about it as weak or as sound, then the intended meaning of his specified statement has been achieved; but if he is silent about it and does not mention anything, then what this statement entails is that it is sound or hasan, according to his words, may Allah Most High have mercy on him.

P6808 - Ruling on leaving a sunnah practice for the sake of winning hearts over

P6808a - The question
Is it permissible to leave a sunnah practice for the interest of daʿwah, and to win hearts over?

P6808b - The answer
Winning hearts over is by following the Sunnah and calling to it, not by leaving sunnah practices in order to obtain something that he may not obtain; thus he has lost this and that.

P6809 - Ruling on greeting a woman when there is a need to speak with her

P6809a - The question
A man may be compelled to speak with a young woman about some matter from behind a veil; does he begin the conversation with salam and end it with salam?

P6809b - The answer
The beginning of speech is the salam. But speaking with a young woman or with others is only within the bounds of the intended and required purpose: for example, he calls on the telephone and a woman answers; first he gives salam, then he asks about the person: is he present or not present? and he ends at this limit. There should not be any drawn-out conversation, back and forth.

P6810 - Clarifying the principle: (There is no rebuke in issues of disagreement)

P6810a - The question
What do you say about one who says that there is no rebuke regarding the issue of singing with musical instruments, and likewise the issue of acting, on the pretext that the ummah’s disagreement is a mercy and on the juristic principle: there is no rebuke in issues of disagreement?

P6810b - The answer
Not every disagreement is considered. What is relied upon is the evidences, and if the evidence becomes clear and is present, then it is not permissible to oppose it. It is not permissible to abandon rebuke because someone has differed in that, because what matters is the establishment of the evidence and the manifestation of the truth, even if someone says otherwise. One does not leave the truth because there is disagreement about it. If it were the case that anything in which there is disagreement is not spoken about, then there would be no clarification of the truth. Rather, among disputed issues are those in which the other statement has no evidence for it, or it is ijtihad in opposition to a text, or analogical reasoning in opposition to a clear, manifest text. So clarification and explanation are necessary.

P6811 - Ruling on men beating the duff at weddings

P6811a - The question
Is it permissible for men to beat the duff in a wedding celebration?

P6811b - The answer
That is not permissible for men; rather, it is permissible only for women, because it has been reported concerning women and it has not been reported concerning men.

P6812 - Ruling on feasts before the wedding

P6812a - The question
What some people do of feasts before the marriage contract, of what is called the shabka and the like—does that count as extravagance?

P6812b - The answer
There is no doubt that it is from affectation and from things that burden the husband. Leaving these things, and sufficing with a single walimah without exaggeration in it, is what should be done.

P6813 - Extent of the soundness of the statement that Jesus, peace be upon him, will be buried beside the Prophet ﷺ

P6813a - The question
Some people say: Jesus, peace be upon him, will be buried beside the grave of the Prophet ﷺ. How sound is this statement?

P6813b - The answer
I do not know anything about its soundness.

P6814 - Meaning of the Prophet’s ﷺ statement: (And I am a security for my Companions)

P6814a - The question
In a hadith from the Prophet ﷺ it says: (The stars are a security for the sky; when the stars depart, the sky will come what it has been promised; and I am a security for my Companions.) What is meant by his statement: (I am a security for my Companions)?

P6814b - The answer
Its meaning is that his presence among them was a security for them from the disagreement that occurred after his death ﷺ, and the hadith is authentic and established from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ.

P6815 - Response regarding the hadith about some Companions practicing mutʿah until the time of Umar, may Allah be pleased with him

P6815a - The question
In the hadith it says: (We used to practice mutʿah for days with a handful of dates and flour during the time of the Prophet ﷺ and Abu Bakr, until Umar forbade it.) What is the response to this hadith, since it indicates that the prohibition of mutʿah was delayed?

P6815b - The answer
Ibn al-Qayyim said in (Zad al-Maʿad fi Hady Khayr al-ʿIbad), may Allah Most High have mercy on him: If it is said: What do you do with what Muslim narrated in his Sahih from Jabir ibn Abd Allah, may Allah be pleased with them both, that he said: We used to practice mutʿah for days with a handful of dates and flour during the time of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him, until Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, forbade it concerning Amr ibn Harith; and with what is established from Umar that he said: Two mutʿahs were during the time of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, and I forbid them: the mutʿah of women and the mutʿah of Hajj.
It is said: People regarding this are two groups. One group says: Umar is the one who prohibited it and forbade it, and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ commanded following what the Rightly Guided Caliphs instituted. This group did not view as authentic the hadith of Sabrah ibn Maʿbad regarding the prohibition of mutʿah in the year of the Conquest, for it is from the narration of Abd al-Malik ibn al-Rabiʿ ibn Sabrah from his father from his grandfather, and Ibn Maʿin spoke against him. Al-Bukhari did not see fit to include his hadith in his Sahih despite the severe need for it, and its being a foundational principle of Islam; had it been authentic with him, he would not have refrained from including it and using it as proof.
They said: If the hadith of Sabrah were authentic, it would not have been hidden from Ibn Masʿud, may Allah be pleased with him, such that he would narrate that they did it and cite the verse as proof. Also, if it were authentic, Umar would not have said: It was during the time of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and I forbid it and punish for it; rather, he would have said: He ﷺ prohibited it and forbade it. They said: And if it were authentic, it would not have been practiced during the time of al-Siddiq, which truly was the time of the caliphate of Prophethood.
The second group held the hadith of Sabrah to be authentic. And even if it were not authentic, the hadith of Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ prohibited the mutʿah of women is authentic. Therefore, it is necessary to interpret the hadith of Jabir as meaning that the one who reported its being practiced had not received news of the prohibition, and it had not become widespread until the time of Umar, may Allah be pleased with him. When dispute about it occurred, its prohibition became manifest and widespread, and thus the hadiths narrated regarding it are reconciled. And Allah is the One who grants success.
This clarifies what is meant: that news reaches them, and after that it became widespread and manifest in the time of Umar, may Allah be pleased with him and be pleased with him. Something similar to this is the hadith of A’ishah, may Allah Most High be pleased with her: (Among what was revealed of the Quran were ten known sucklings that made marriage unlawful; then they were abrogated by five known; and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ passed away while they were among what was recited of the Quran.) Even though they were abrogated, because the time was close, some people after the death of the Messenger ﷺ would recite them and did not know of the abrogation. So this is of this type, as Ibn al-Qayyim said.

P6816 - Ruling on the guardian stipulating for the husband that he not marry over his ward

P6816a - The question
May the woman’s guardian stipulate in the contract that the husband not marry another wife besides his daughter?

P6816b - The answer
There is no harm in that, because he wants that his daughter not be harmed and that nothing occur that harms her. Whoever does not want this should seek someone else; the matter is broad. But what is blameworthy is that a woman already exists and then another woman comes and stipulates the divorce of the existing one who has obtained provision and good. As for what is mentioned in the question, there is no harm in it.

P6817 - Ruling on preventing the suitor from looking at his fiancée

P6817a - The question
We have a custom in which we do not allow the suitor to look at the woman he is proposing to, and if he requests it we prevent him. Is there any sin upon us?

P6817b - The answer
As for sin, I do not know of it. Looking is not obligatory, and the Prophet’s ﷺ statement: (If you are able to look) indicates that there can be a marriage without looking.

P6818 - An advisory word to students of knowledge during the vacation days

P6818a - The question
In view of the end of studies for this year, and the fact that all the students are returning to their countries, we hope for your guidance to the students in calling to Allah, Glorified and Exalted.

P6818b - The answer
This vacation is an opportunity for a person to seize and benefit from, and not let it be wasted without benefit, by doing what he can do that returns to him with good and returns to others with good: through reading and study, and reading some beneficial, useful books; or undertaking calling to Allah, Mighty and Majestic, and calling to good; or teaching some people who are in need of being taught, so he teaches them the matters of their religion and gives them understanding in them. This is part of calling to Allah, Mighty and Majestic, because calling to Allah is through teaching, and it is through reminding: there are people whom he teaches and people whom he reminds, and all of that is part of calling to Allah, Mighty and Majestic. The important matter is that a person benefits from the vacation and does not let the opportunity be wasted on himself, without using it in what returns to him and to others with good.
If a person does not have the ability to call to Allah, Mighty and Majestic, and to teach others, then at the very least he should read some beneficial, useful books such as the book (Iʿlam al-Muwaqqiʿin) by Ibn al-Qayyim. It is a precious book containing tremendous knowledge, and mentioning principles in the Shariʿah and the wisdoms of legal rulings; it contains fundamentals and branches. Likewise, the book (Zad al-Maʿad fi Hady Khayr al-ʿIbad) is a great book. If he reads books like these, and he comes out of the vacation having read such books, then he will have come out with profit and benefit. If he does not accustom himself to doing such work, the vacation will end and he will not have profited from it, nor attained anything of significance, because he wasted the opportunity on himself. But if, from the outset, he firmly resolves to strive and benefit from the break, then he will attain and benefit without it being wasted on him pointlessly without benefit. This is a brief advice I would like to say on this occasion.

P6819 - Stance toward the book al-Asas fi al-Tafsir and its author

P6819a - The question
What is your view of the book al-Asas fi al-Tafsir by Saʿid Hawwa, and what is your view of its author?

P6819b - The answer
I do not know the book, but I know that the author of the book is confused and mixed up, and it is not suitable that anything from his books be read because of what they contain of confusion. A person should read reliable books and beneficial books from which he comes out with benefit, such as the two books that I pointed to: (Iʿlam al-Muwaqqiʿin) and (Zad al-Maʿad); and such as the tafsir of Shaykh Ibn Saʿdi. If a person wants to read a reliable tafsir and a clear tafsir that he can read and complete, with clear and plain expressions, then he should read the tafsir of Shaykh Abd al-Rahman ibn Saʿdi, may Allah have mercy on him. It is a valuable and great tafsir suitable for the general public and the elite, because it is in clear expressions that both the specialist and the general person understand. It does not contain: “it was said such-and-such, and it was said such-and-such, and it was said such-and-such,” for these are things that may confuse the general public. Rather, its expressions are clear and plain: it analyzes the verses and clarifies their meanings in clear, plain, understandable expressions. The reader should read from people who have safety from confusion, who are people of knowledge and not people of new methodologies that deviate from the straight path.

P6820 - What is to be done after a shighar marriage done in ignorance

P6820a - The question
If two people marry by way of shighar while being ignorant of the ruling, are they separated?

P6820b - The answer
If mutual acceptance and harmony are present, then the contract is renewed.

P6821 - The time of looking at the woman being proposed to

P6821a - The question
Is looking at the woman being proposed to before the proposal, or after it?

P6821b - The answer
Some of the people of knowledge said: it is before the proposal. If he resolves to propose to her, then he looks at her before he proposes to her. They said: if he proposes to her and then sees her after that, he may not desire her; and this is only by way of hiding. As for by way of requesting, there is no way to see her unless he is a suitor.

P6822 - Explanation of Sunan Abi Dawud [240]
Marriage is among the greatest matters that Islam has regulated, and it has made it a fortress for preserving honor and limiting the spread of indecencies. The Shariʿah has stipulated that marriage be conducted through the woman’s guardian, and it has invalidated a marriage if it is without the guardian’s permission.

P6823 - Guardianship in marriage

P6824 - Explanation of the hadith: (Any woman who marries without the permission of her guardians, then her marriage is invalid)
The compiler, may Allah Most High have mercy on him, said: [Chapter on the guardian.
Muḥammad ibn Kathīr narrated to us; Sufyān informed us; Ibn Jurayj informed us, from Sulaymān ibn Mūsā, from al-Zuhrī, from ʿUrwah, from ʿĀʾishah, may Allah be pleased with her, who said: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: (Any woman who marries without the permission of her guardians, then her marriage is invalid—three times. If he consummates with her, then the mahr is hers for what he has taken from her; and if they dispute, then the ruler is the guardian of one who has no guardian.)].
Imam Abu Dawud al-Sijistani, may Allah Most High have mercy on him, says: [Chapter on the guardian].
That is: the guardian who undertakes the marriage contract on behalf of the husband with a woman. It is necessary that she have a guardian to undertake that; she does not undertake it herself, nor does a stranger who is not among her guardians undertake it, except by deputization from the guardian. Guardianship in marriage existed in al-Jahiliyyah, as has come in Sahih al-Bukhari from A’ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, that in al-Jahiliyyah a man would come to a man and propose his ward from him, and he would marry her to him. So this ruling—namely, the necessity of a guardian in marriage—was among the matters that existed in al-Jahiliyyah, and Islam affirmed it.

P6825 - The wisdom in considering the guardian in marriage and the evidences for stipulating it in the Book and the Sunnah
It is known that the Sunnah of the Messenger ﷺ is by speech, action, and approval. The Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ has come with stipulating the guardian, as in the hadith that Abu Dawud and others cited. That has also come in the Noble Quran, and there has also come approval of this ruling that existed in al-Jahiliyyah, and that it is among the rulings that existed and that Islam affirmed.
This is something commendable, because in it is keeping the woman away from appearing by being preoccupied with marriage, and modesty predominates over them. Thus the Book and the Sunnah came with stipulating the guardian in marriage, and that it is necessary that a woman have a guardian who contracts the marriage for her to the one who will marry her. In the Quran there is what indicates this, in the statement of Allah, Mighty and Majestic: “So do not prevent them from marrying their husbands” [al-Baqarah: 232]. It is an address to the guardians. If a woman were able to conclude the contract for herself, or someone other than her guardians could do that, then there would have been no need to forbid the guardians from preventing them, when they prevent them from marrying their husbands.
This is because the verse was revealed regarding Maʿqil ibn Yasar, may Allah be pleased with him. He had a sister whom he married off to a relative of his; then he divorced her. When her waiting period ended, he came to propose to her again, and Maʿqil swore that he would not marry her to him. That reached the Prophet ﷺ, and the verse was revealed: “So do not prevent them from marrying their husbands,” meaning: those who divorced them and whose waiting period ended.
As for when he divorced her while she was still in the waiting period, then the matter belongs to the husband, because he has the right of return. But when the woman exits the waiting period, he becomes one suitor among the suitors. If she wishes to return to him, her guardian does not prevent her from that; and if she wishes not to accept him, and she desires another person besides him, then she may do so.
So this noble verse contains a forbiddance to the guardians from prevention (ʿadl), which is their refusal to marry off the divorced husbands when the women are pleased with those husbands who divorced them. The guardian is thus required to contract for her with the husband who divorced her, whose waiting period ended, and who wants to marry her again. The verse is clear in indicating that guardianship is necessary, because if it were not necessary there would have been no need to forbid them; rather, she would dispose of her own affair if the matter were up to her. The Sunnah of the Messenger ﷺ has come with hadiths that Abu Dawud cited in this chapter, and he cited hadiths indicating that the guardian is necessary in marriage.
He first cited the hadith of the Mother of the Believers A’ishah, may Allah be pleased with her and cause her to be pleasing, that the Prophet ﷺ said: (Any woman who marries without the permission of her guardians, then her marriage is invalid—three times), meaning that he said: invalid, invalid, invalid. He repeated that for emphasis. He said: (If he consummates with her, then the mahr is hers for what he has taken from her; and if they dispute, then the ruler is the guardian of one who has no guardian.)
The Messenger of Allah’s ﷺ statement: (Any woman who marries without the permission of her guardians, then her marriage is invalid) indicates that guardianship is a condition in marriage, and that if the contract is concluded without a guardian then it is invalid. If a woman contracts for herself, or authorizes someone to contract for her, and she is the one who undertakes that without the permission of the guardians, then it is invalid, as the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said. This is general, meaning that any woman for whom that occurs without a guardian, the marriage is invalid, and it is null as if it never occurred, because it has lost this condition, which is the guardian in marriage.
What is intended by his statement: (the permission of her guardians) is that they conclude the contract or permit someone to conclude it; that is, either the guardian concludes it himself, or he permits someone to conclude it on his behalf.
The intent is that marriage is not valid unless it is from a guardian or an agent of a guardian. It is not intended that a woman may marry herself off with her guardian’s permission, because she does not have guardianship in concluding the marriage contract for herself.
The guardian is the one among her agnatic relatives, the nearest then the nearest: the father, then the grandfather, then the son, then the son’s son, then the full brother, then the brother by the father, then the full brother’s son, then the brother-by-father’s son, then the full paternal uncle, then the paternal uncle by the father, then the full paternal uncle’s son, then the paternal uncle-by-father’s son, and so on according to the order. Other than the agnates are not guardians: neither uterine relatives, nor those who inherit by fixed shares, such as brothers by the mother.
The guardian who undertakes the contract must be adult. Ascendants are given precedence over others, descendants are given precedence over collateral relatives, and if the lower guardian concludes the contract while the higher exists, it is valid if the higher approves it. If the one entitled to it relinquishes it to one below him, then the contract is valid.

P6826 - Invalidating the contract that is devoid of a guardian
Then he said: (If he consummates with her), meaning: if he enters upon her by this contract that is not sound, (then the mahr is hers for what he has taken from her), meaning: what he gave her as a mahr is not returned to him so long as he has taken her and had intercourse with her, because it is hers in exchange for what he made lawful of her private part.
If the guardians dispute—meaning that they differ or they prevent—then guardianship transfers to the ruler: (the ruler is the guardian of one who has no guardian). This also indicates that the woman has no right to conclude the marriage contract, since the Shariʿah has placed that right with the guardians, then it transfers to the ruler and does not transfer to her. The matter returns to the guardians; then if they do not exist, or they exist but they are preventing and refusing to fulfill her wish and marry her to one who is suitable to marry her, then that matter transfers to the ruler, due to his statement: (and if they dispute, then the ruler is the guardian of one who has no guardian)."""

Finalizing full translation without truncation
I realized that I accidentally truncated parts of the translation with ellipses, and that’s not allowed. I also included Arabic words, which should not be there. I need to ensure I provide the entire translation in full, without any truncation or unnecessary symbols. I’ll work on this now.

Finalizing translation with consistent transliteration
I’ll produce the translation in parts and then combine them. For P6806a, I need to include the content in parentheses and the Quran verses with full references. In my earlier attempt, I used “Abdullah” simply, but for narrators in the chain, I should use ALA-LC. Looks good for P6806a! For P6806b, I didn't use ALA-LC for "Ibn Abbas"; however, it's about him, so it's fine to omit the diacritics since the narrator is in the chain. I’ll stick with that approach.

Clarifying transliteration choices for consistency
I'm considering whether to use ALA-LC diacritics for non-narrator names and book titles. The instructions specify ALA-LC for narrators in the chain, so that's clear there. However, for book titles and non-narrators, I might avoid diacritics to stay consistent with the guidelines—using "Majmu’ al-Fatawa" without the emphasis marks. It's tricky, though.

Ensuring consistent transliteration and final translation quality
To avoid accidental violations of the transliteration rules, I’ll avoid using special diacritical letters like ʿ and macrons outside narrator names, and use plain apostrophes ("da'wah", "Shari'ah", etc.). I also need to fix any truncations and use regular quotes for readability. The final translation will need thorough crafting to maintain quality, and I'll handle it carefully, translating each segment manually.

Translating P6806a hadith for childbirth
I need to translate the P6806a hadith focused on childbirth, starting with a phrase that I'll render as: "In the name of Allah, there is no deity but Allah, the Forbearing, the Noble. Glory be to Allah, Lord of the Mighty Throne..." I'll also translate technical terms like "tammat" and ensure clarity with how actions are described, e.g., drinking from a clean vessel or sprinkling below the navel.

Translating detailed text and commentary
I’ll translate the hadith literally and keep important terms like "sahih" and "hasan." Regarding the later quote, I’ll maintain the structure of the original, especially technical terms like "end quote." For larger sections, like P6810b and beyond, I’ll translate each in full. I also need to account for special notes about the Quran verse and a Bukhari hadith.

Finalizing translation and name usage guidelines
For the translation, I'll stick to plain text without markdown, avoiding Arabic except when necessary for narrator names in the chain. Terms like "al-Jahiliyyah" will be rendered without diacritics or special characters, while narrator names in the chain can include ALA-LC diacritics. I'll mainly use "the Prophet ﷺ" without diacritics outside the chain.

Finalizing the translation process
I need to ensure no diacritics like ḥ appear in words such as “sahih”; these should remain plain without special characters. “Hadith” and similar words are fine without them, as they are not names. I'll also include the citation at the end, following the user’s preference for plain-text output. I'll use Python to check for Arabic characters and verify the completeness of the translation before finalizing.

P6802 - Questions

P6803 - Jābir, may Allah be pleased with him, hiding in order to see the woman he intended to propose to: was that in his first marriage?
In the hadith, Jābir was hiding to see the one he wanted to marry; so is she the one the Prophet ﷺ asked him about when he said: (Have you married? He said: Yes. He said: A virgin or a previously married woman? He said: A previously married woman, O Messenger of Allah ﷺ!), or is it the story of another marriage of Jābir?

P6803a - The answer
There is nothing indicating that she was the same woman, so it could have been her or someone else.

P6804 - What may be looked at of the body of the woman being proposed to

P6804a - The question
What is it that may be looked at of the woman being proposed to? Is it permissible to look at other than the face and the two hands?

P6804b - The answer
He looks only at the two hands and the face, and he does not go beyond that. There is disagreement: some scholars say he may look at her hair, and some hold that looking at more than that is permissible, and this is what is transmitted from Ibn Hazm.

P6805 - Ruling on seeking permission from a woman's paternal cousins when intending to marry her

P6805a - The question
Among some tribes, whoever intends to marry a woman must seek permission from her paternal cousins; what is the ruling on this?

P6805b - The answer
This is from the matters of al-Jahiliyyah; her paternal cousins do not own her, and they have no right to prevent her from marrying whom she wants.

P6806 - Ruling on writing some verses in a vessel so that the one whose childbirth is difficult may be given its water to drink

P6806a - The question
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah, may Allah Most High have mercy on him, said: It is permissible to write, for the afflicted person and others among the sick, something from the Book of Allah and His remembrance with permissible ink, and it is washed and drunk, as Ahmad and others stated. Abdullah, the son of Imam Ahmad, said: I read to my father: Yaʿlā ibn ʿUbayd narrated to us; Sufyān narrated to us; from Muḥammad ibn Abī Laylā; from al-Ḥakam; from Saʿīd ibn Jubayr; from Ibn ʿAbbās, may Allah be pleased with them both, who said: If childbirth becomes difficult for a woman, then let him write: (In the name of Allah. There is no deity but Allah, the Forbearing, the Generous. Glory be to Allah, Lord of the Mighty Throne. All praise is for Allah, Lord of the worlds [al-Fatihah: 2]. As if, on the day they see it, they had not remained except an evening or its forenoon [al-Nazi'at: 46]. As if, on the day they see what they are promised, they had not remained except an hour of a day. A conveyance, so shall any be destroyed except the defiantly disobedient people [al-Ahqaf: 35].)
My father said: Aswad ibn ʿĀmir narrated to us, with his isnad, with its meaning; and he said: It is written in a clean vessel and then she is given to drink.
My father said: And Wakīʿ added to it: then she is given to drink, and that which is below her navel is sprinkled.
Abdullah said: I saw my father write for a woman in a basin, or something clean, and so on to the end.
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah نقل this statement in (Majmu' al-Fatawa).
So it is understood from what he نقل that it is written for a woman in a clean vessel; then she is given to drink, and that which is below her navel is sprinkled with it, in order to facilitate childbirth; and he نقل it from Ahmad. So is this act sound?

P6806b - The answer
This isnad is not authentic from Ibn Abbas so long as it contains Muhammad ibn Abi Layla. As for what is reported from some of the salaf, as Ibn Taymiyyah mentioned, and likewise Ibn al-Qayyim in the book (Zad al-Ma'ad), regarding writing verses on occasions and in various situations, then it appears—and Allah knows best—that leaving that is better, because there is no evidence for it.

P6807 - What al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar meant by his stipulating soundness or hasan for what he cited from the principal musnads, jawami', and others in al-Fath

P6807a - The question
Al-Hafiz, may Allah Most High have mercy on him, said in the introduction to (Hady al-Sari): “Then I extract, secondly, what relates to that hadith, for a valid purpose, of the benefits of the text and the chain: completions and additions, uncovering what is obscure, an explicit statement by a mudallis of hearing, and a corroboration by one who heard from a shaykh who had become confused before that; extracting all of that from the principal musnads, jawami', mustakhraj works, ajza', and fawa'id, on the condition of soundness or hasan in what I mention of that.”
End of quote.
So what did al-Hafiz mean by his statement: “on the condition of soundness or hasan”? Is everything al-Hafiz brought in al-Fath judged by this ruling, as is common among students of knowledge, or is the ruling restricted to what he detailed, may Allah have mercy on him, of benefits, completions, and additions related to the hadith being explained and discussed?

P6807b - The answer
This statement is understood to mean that if he speaks about it as weak or as sound, then the intended meaning of his specified statement has been achieved; but if he is silent about it and does not mention anything, then what this statement entails is that it is sound or hasan, according to his words, may Allah Most High have mercy on him.

P6808 - Ruling on leaving a sunnah practice for the sake of winning hearts over

P6808a - The question
Is it permissible to leave a sunnah practice for the interest of da'wah, and to win hearts over?

P6808b - The answer
Winning hearts over is by following the Sunnah and calling to it, not by leaving sunnah practices in order to obtain something that he may not obtain; thus he has lost this and that.

P6809 - Ruling on greeting a woman when there is a need to speak with her

P6809a - The question
A man may be compelled to speak with a young woman about some matter from behind a veil; does he begin the conversation with salam and end it with salam?

P6809b - The answer
The beginning of speech is the salam. But speaking with a young woman or with others is only within the bounds of the intended and required purpose, such as when he calls on the telephone and a woman answers: first he gives salam, then he asks about the person, whether he is present or not present, and he ends at this limit. There should not be any drawn-out conversation, taking and giving.

P6810 - Clarifying the principle: (There is no rebuke in issues of disagreement)

P6810a - The question
What do you say about one who says that there is no rebuke regarding the issue of singing with musical instruments, and likewise the issue of acting, on the pretext that the ummah's disagreement is a mercy, and on the juristic principle: there is no rebuke in issues of disagreement?

P6810b - The answer
Not every disagreement is considered. What is relied upon is the evidences, and if the evidence becomes clear and is present, then it is not permissible to oppose it. It is not permissible to abandon rebuke because someone has differed in that, because what matters is the establishment of the evidence and the manifestation of the truth, even if someone says otherwise. One does not leave the truth because there is disagreement about it. If it were the case that anything in which there is disagreement is not spoken about, then there would be no clarification of the truth. Rather, among disputed issues are those in which the other view has no evidence, or it is ijtihad in the face of a text, or analogy in the face of a clear and manifest text; therefore explanation and clarification are necessary.

P6811 - Ruling on men beating the duff at weddings

P6811a - The question
Is it permissible for men to beat the duff in a wedding celebration?

P6811b - The answer
That is not permissible for men; rather, it is permissible only for women, because it has been reported concerning women and it has not been reported concerning men.

P6812 - Ruling on feasts before the wedding

P6812a - The question
What some people do of feasts before the marriage contract, of what is called the shabka and the like—does that count as extravagance?

P6812b - The answer
There is no doubt that it is from affectation and from things that burden the husband. Leaving these things, and sufficing with a single walimah without exaggeration in it, is what should be done.

P6813 - Extent of the soundness of the statement that Jesus, peace be upon him, will be buried beside the Prophet ﷺ

P6813a - The question
Some people say: Jesus, peace be upon him, will be buried beside the grave of the Prophet ﷺ. How sound is this statement?

P6813b - The answer
I do not know anything about its soundness.

P6814 - Meaning of the Prophet's ﷺ statement: (And I am a security for my Companions)

P6814a - The question
In a hadith from the Prophet ﷺ it says: (The stars are a security for the sky; when the stars depart, the sky will come what it has been promised; and I am a security for my Companions.) What is meant by his statement: (I am a security for my Companions)?

P6814b - The answer
Its meaning is that his presence among them was a security for them from the disagreement that occurred after his death ﷺ, and the hadith is sound and established from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ.

P6815 - Response regarding the hadith about some Companions practicing mut'ah until the time of Umar, may Allah be pleased with him

P6815a - The question
In the hadith it says: (We used to practice mut'ah for days with a handful of dates and flour during the time of the Prophet ﷺ and Abu Bakr, until Umar forbade it.) What is the response to this hadith, since it indicates that the prohibition of mut'ah was delayed?

P6815b - The answer
Ibn al-Qayyim said in (Zad al-Ma'ad fi Hady Khayr al-'Ibad), may Allah Most High have mercy on him: If it is said: What do you do with what Muslim narrated in his Sahih from Jabir ibn Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with them both, that he said: We used to practice mut'ah for days with a handful of dates and flour during the time of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him, until Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, forbade it concerning Amr ibn Harith; and with what is established from Umar that he said: Two mut'ahs were during the time of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, and I forbid them: the mut'ah of women and the mut'ah of Hajj.
It is said: People regarding this are two groups. One group says: Umar is the one who prohibited it and forbade it. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ commanded following what the Rightly Guided Caliphs instituted. This group did not view as authentic the hadith of Sabrah ibn Ma'bad regarding the prohibition of mut'ah in the year of the Conquest. It is from the narration of Abd al-Malik ibn al-Rabi' ibn Sabrah from his father from his grandfather, and Ibn Ma'in spoke against him. Al-Bukhari did not see fit to include his hadith in his Sahih, despite the severe need for it and its being a foundational principle of Islam; and if it had been authentic to him, he would not have refrained from including it and using it as proof.
They said: If the hadith of Sabrah were authentic, it would not have been hidden from Ibn Mas'ud, may Allah be pleased with him, such that he would narrate that they did it and cite the verse as proof. Also, if it were authentic, Umar would not have said: It was during the time of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and I forbid it and punish for it; rather, he would have said: He ﷺ prohibited it and forbade it. They said: And if it were authentic, it would not have been practiced during the time of al-Siddiq, which truly was the time of the caliphate of Prophethood.
The second group held the hadith of Sabrah to be authentic; and even if it were not authentic, the hadith of Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ prohibited the mut'ah of women is authentic. Therefore, it is necessary to interpret the hadith of Jabir as meaning that the one who reported its being practiced did not have the prohibition reach him, and it had not become widespread until the time of Umar, may Allah be pleased with him. When dispute about it occurred, its prohibition became manifest and widespread, and by this the hadiths narrated regarding it are harmonized, and by Allah is the granting of success.
This clarifies what is meant, and that it reaches them, and after that it became widespread and manifest in the time of Umar, may Allah be pleased with him and grant him His pleasure. Something similar to this is the hadith of A'ishah, may Allah Most High be pleased with her: (Among what was revealed of the Quran were ten known sucklings that made unlawful; then they were abrogated by five known; and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ passed away while they were among what was recited of the Quran.) Even though they were abrogated, because the time was close, some people after the Messenger's ﷺ death would recite them and did not know of the abrogation. This is of this type, as Ibn al-Qayyim said.

P6816 - Ruling on the guardian stipulating for the husband that he not marry over his ward

P6816a - The question
May the woman's guardian stipulate in the contract that the husband not marry another wife besides his daughter?

P6816b - The answer
There is no harm in that, because he wants that his daughter not be harmed and that nothing occur that harms her. Whoever does not want this should seek someone else; the matter is broad. But what is blameworthy is that a woman already exists and then another woman comes and stipulates the divorce of the existing one who has obtained provision and good. As for what is mentioned in the question, there is no harm in it.

P6817 - Ruling on preventing the suitor from looking at his fiancée

P6817a - The question
We have a custom in which we do not allow the suitor to look at the woman he is proposing to, and if he requests it we prevent him. Is there any sin upon us?

P6817b - The answer
I do not know of sin occurring, and looking is not obligatory. The Prophet's ﷺ statement: (If you are able to look) indicates that there can be a marriage without looking.

P6818 - An advisory word to students of knowledge during the vacation days

P6818a - The question
In view of the end of studies for this year, and the fact that all the students are returning to their countries, we hope for your guidance to the students in calling to Allah, Glorified and Exalted.

P6818b - The answer
This vacation is an opportunity for a person to seize and benefit from, and not let it be wasted without benefit. That is by doing whatever he can do that returns to him with good and returns to others with good: through reading and study and reading some beneficial, useful books; or undertaking calling to Allah, Mighty and Majestic, and calling to good; or teaching some people who are in need of being taught, so he teaches them the matters of their religion and gives them understanding in them. This is part of calling to Allah, Mighty and Majestic, because calling to Allah is by teaching and by reminding: to people he teaches, and to people he reminds. All of that is calling to Allah, Mighty and Majestic. What matters is that a person benefits from the vacation and does not let the opportunity be lost to him, without using it for what brings him and others good.
If a person does not have the ability to call to Allah, Mighty and Majestic, and to teach others, then at the very least he should read some beneficial, useful books, such as the book (I'lam al-Muwaqqi'in) by Ibn al-Qayyim. It is a precious book containing tremendous knowledge, mentioning principles in the Shari'ah and the wisdoms of legal rulings; it contains fundamentals and branches. Likewise, the book (Zad al-Ma'ad fi Hady Khayr al-'Ibad) is a great book. If he reads books like these, and he comes out of the vacation having read such books, then he will have come out with profit and benefit. If he does not train himself to do such work, then the vacation will end and he will not have profited in it anything, nor achieved anything considerable, because he has missed the opportunity for himself. But if he resolves from the beginning to strive and benefit from the break, then he will achieve and benefit without it being wasted upon him with no benefit. This is a brief advice that I like to say on this occasion.

P6819 - Stance toward the book al-Asas fi al-Tafsir and its author

P6819a - The question
What is your view of the book al-Asas fi al-Tafsir by Sa'id Hawwa, and what is your view of its author?

P6819b - The answer
I do not know the book, but I know that the author of the book is confused and mixed up, and it is not suitable that anything from his books be read because of what they contain of confusion. A person should read reliable books and beneficial books from which he comes out with benefit, such as the two books that I pointed to: (I'lam al-Muwaqqi'in) and (Zad al-Ma'ad), and such as the tafsir of Shaykh Ibn Sa'di. If a person wants to read a reliable tafsir and a clear tafsir that he can read and complete, with clear and manifest expressions, then he should read the tafsir of Shaykh Abd al-Rahman ibn Sa'di, may Allah have mercy on him. It is a valuable and great tafsir, suitable for both the common people and the elite, because it is in clear expressions that both the elite and the common understand. It does not contain: “It was said such-and-such, and it was said such-and-such, and it was said such-and-such,” for these are things that can confuse the common people. Its expressions are clear and manifest; he analyzes the verses and clarifies their meanings with clear, manifest, understandable expressions. The reader should read from people who are safe from confusion, who are people of knowledge and not people of new methodologies that deviate from the straight path.

P6820 - What is to be done after a shighar marriage done in ignorance

P6820a - The question
If two people marry by way of shighar while being ignorant of the ruling, are they separated?

P6820b - The answer
If mutual acceptance and harmony are present, then the contract is renewed.

P6821 - The time of looking at the woman being proposed to

P6821a - The question
Is looking at the woman being proposed to before the proposal, or after it?

P6821b - The answer
Some of the people of knowledge said: it is before the proposal. If he resolves to propose to her, then he looks at her before he proposes to her. They said: if he proposes to her and then sees her after that, he may not desire her; and this is only by way of hiding. As for by way of requesting, there is no way to see her unless he is a suitor.

P6822 - Sharh Sunan Abi Dawud [240]
Marriage is among the greatest matters that Islam has regulated, and it has made it a fortress for preserving honor and limiting the spread of indecencies. The Shari'ah has stipulated that marriage issue from the woman's guardian, and it has invalidated a marriage if it is without the guardian's permission.

P6823 - Guardianship in marriage

P6824 - Explanation of the hadith: (Any woman who marries without the permission of her guardians, then her marriage is invalid)
The compiler, may Allah Most High have mercy on him, said: [Chapter on the guardian.
Muḥammad ibn Kathīr narrated to us; Sufyān informed us; Ibn Jurayj informed us, from Sulaymān ibn Mūsā, from al-Zuhrī, from ʿUrwah, from ʿĀʾishah, may Allah be pleased with her, who said: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: (Any woman who marries without the permission of her guardians, then her marriage is invalid—three times. If he consummates with her, then the mahr is hers for what he has taken from her; and if they dispute, then the ruler is the guardian of one who has no guardian.)].
Imam Abu Dawud al-Sijistani, may Allah Most High have mercy on him, says: [Chapter on the guardian].
That is: the guardian who undertakes the marriage contract for a man with a woman. It is necessary that she have a guardian who undertakes that; she does not undertake it herself, nor does a stranger who is not among her guardians undertake it, except by deputization from the guardian. Guardianship in marriage existed in al-Jahiliyyah, as has come in Sahih al-Bukhari from A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, that in al-Jahiliyyah a man would come to a man and propose his ward from him, and he would marry her to him. Thus this ruling, namely the obligation of the guardian in marriage, is among the matters that existed in al-Jahiliyyah and that Islam affirmed.

P6825 - The wisdom in considering the guardian in marriage and the evidences for stipulating it in the Book and the Sunnah
It is known that the Sunnah of the Messenger ﷺ is by speech, action, and approval. The Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ has come with stipulating the guardian, as in the hadith that Abu Dawud and others cited. That has also come in the Noble Quran, and there has also come approval of this ruling that existed in al-Jahiliyyah, and that it is among the rulings that existed and that Islam affirmed.
This is something commendable, because in it is keeping the woman away from appearing by being preoccupied with marriage, and modesty predominates over them. Thus the Book and the Sunnah came with stipulating the guardian in marriage, and that it is necessary that a woman have a guardian who contracts the marriage for her to the one who will marry her. In the Quran there is what indicates this, in the statement of Allah, Mighty and Majestic: “So do not prevent them from marrying their husbands” [al-Baqarah: 232]. This is an address to the guardians. If a woman were able to contract for herself, or someone other than her guardians could do so, there would have been no need to forbid the guardians from prevention, when they prevent them from marrying their husbands.
This is because the verse was revealed regarding Ma'qil ibn Yasar, may Allah be pleased with him. He had a sister whom he married off to a relative of his; then he divorced her. When her waiting period ended, he came to propose to her again, and Ma'qil swore that he would not marry her to him. That reached the Prophet ﷺ, and the verse was revealed: “So do not prevent them from marrying their husbands,” meaning: those who divorced them and whose waiting period ended.
As for when he divorced her while she was still in the waiting period, then the matter belongs to the husband, because he has the right of return. But when the woman exits the waiting period, he becomes one suitor among the suitors: if she wishes to return to him, her guardian does not prevent her from that; and if she wishes not to accept him, and she desires another person besides him, then she may do so.
So this noble verse contains a forbiddance to the guardians from prevention (adl), which is their refusal to marry off the divorced husbands when the women are pleased with those husbands who divorced them. The guardian is thus required to contract for her with the husband who divorced her, whose waiting period ended, and who wants to marry her again. The verse is clear in indicating that guardianship is necessary, because if it were not necessary there would have been no need to forbid them; rather, she would manage her own affairs if it were up to her.
The Sunnah of the Messenger ﷺ includes the hadiths that Abu Dawud cited in this chapter. He cited hadiths that indicate that a guardian is necessary in marriage. He first cited the hadith of the Mother of the Believers A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her and grant her His pleasure, that the Prophet ﷺ said: (Any woman who marries without the permission of her guardians, then her marriage is invalid—three times), meaning that he said: invalid, invalid, invalid. He repeated that for emphasis. He said: (If he consummates with her, then the mahr is hers for what he has taken from her; and if they dispute, then the ruler is the guardian of one who has no guardian.)
The Messenger of Allah's ﷺ statement: (Any woman who marries without the permission of her guardians, then her marriage is invalid) indicates that guardianship is a condition in marriage, and that if the contract is concluded without a guardian then it is invalid. If a woman contracts for herself, or authorizes someone to contract for her, and she is the one who undertakes that without the permission of the guardians, then it is invalid, as the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said. This is general, meaning that any woman for whom that occurs without a guardian, then the marriage is invalid. It is null, as though it never happened, because it has missed this condition, which is the guardian in marriage.
What is intended by his statement: (the permission of her guardians) is that they conclude the contract or permit someone to conclude it; that is, either the guardian concludes it himself, or he permits someone to conclude it on his behalf.
The intent is that marriage is not valid unless it is from a guardian or an agent of a guardian. It is not intended that a woman may marry herself off with her guardian's permission, because she does not have guardianship in concluding the marriage contract for herself.
The guardian is the one among her agnatic relatives, the nearest then the nearest: the father, then the grandfather, then the son, then the son's son, then the full brother, then the brother by the father, then the full brother's son, then the brother-by-father's son, then the full paternal uncle, then the paternal uncle by the father, then the full paternal uncle's son, then the paternal uncle-by-father's son, and so on according to the order. Other than the agnates are not guardians: neither uterine relatives nor those who inherit by fixed shares, such as maternal brothers.
The guardian who undertakes the contract must be adult. Ascendants are given precedence over others, descendants are given precedence over collateral relatives, and if the lower guardian concludes the contract while the higher exists, it is valid if the higher approves it. If the one entitled to it relinquishes it to one below him, then the contract is valid.

P6826 - Invalidating the contract that is devoid of a guardian
Then he said: (If he consummates with her), meaning: if he enters upon her by this contract that is not sound, (then the mahr is hers for what he has taken from her), meaning: what he gave her as a mahr is not returned to him so long as he has taken her and had intercourse with her, because it is hers in exchange for what he made lawful of her private part.
If the guardians dispute—meaning that they differ or they prevent—then guardianship transfers to the ruler: (the ruler is the guardian of one who has no guardian). This also indicates that the woman has no right to conclude the marriage contract, since the Shari'ah has placed that right with the guardians, then it transfers to the ruler and does not transfer to her. The matter returns to the guardians; then if they do not exist, or they exist but they are preventing and refusing to fulfill her wish and marry her to one who is suitable for marriage to her, then that matter transfers to the ruler, due to his statement: (If they dispute, then the ruler is the guardian of one who has no guardian)."""

P6802 - Questions

P6803 - Jābir, may Allah be pleased with him, hiding in order to see the woman he intended to propose to: was that in his first marriage?
In the hadith, Jābir was hiding to see the one he wanted to marry; so is she the one the Prophet ﷺ asked him about when he said: (Have you married? He said: Yes. He said: A virgin or a previously married woman? He said: A previously married woman, O Messenger of Allah ﷺ!), or is it the story of another marriage of Jābir?

P6803a - The answer
There is nothing indicating that she was the same woman, so it could have been her or someone else.

P6804 - What may be looked at of the body of the woman being proposed to

P6804a - The question
What is it that may be looked at of the woman being proposed to? Is it permissible to look at other than the face and the two hands?

P6804b - The answer
He looks only at the two hands and the face, and he does not go beyond that. There is disagreement: some scholars say he may look at her hair, and some hold that looking at more than that is permissible, and this is what is transmitted from Ibn Hazm.

P6805 - Ruling on seeking permission from a woman's paternal cousins when intending to marry her

P6805a - The question
Among some tribes, whoever intends to marry a woman must seek permission from her paternal cousins; what is the ruling on this?

P6805b - The answer
This is from the matters of al-Jahiliyyah; her paternal cousins do not own her, and they have no right to prevent her from marrying whom she wants.

P6806 - Ruling on writing some verses in a vessel so that the one whose childbirth is difficult may be given its water to drink

P6806a - The question
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah, may Allah Most High have mercy on him, said: It is permissible to write, for the afflicted person and others among the sick, something from the Book of Allah and His remembrance with permissible ink, and it is washed and drunk, as Ahmad and others stated. Abdullah the son of Imam Ahmad said: I read to my father: Yaʿlā ibn ʿUbayd narrated to us; Sufyān narrated to us; from Muḥammad ibn Abī Laylā; from al-Ḥakam; from Saʿīd ibn Jubayr; from Ibn ʿAbbās, may Allah be pleased with them both, who said: If childbirth becomes difficult for a woman, then let him write: (In the name of Allah; there is no deity but Allah, the Forbearing, the Generous. Glory be to Allah, Lord of the Mighty Throne. “All praise is for Allah, Lord of the worlds” [al-Fatihah: 2]. “As if, on the day they see it, they had not remained except an evening or its forenoon” [al-Nazi'at: 46]. “As if, on the day they see what they are promised, they had not remained except an hour of a day. A conveyance (of the message); so shall any be destroyed except the defiantly disobedient people” [al-Ahqaf: 35].)
My father said: Aswad ibn ʿĀmir narrated to us, with his isnad, with its meaning; and he said: It is written in a clean vessel and then she is given to drink.
My father said: And Wakīʿ added in it: then she is given to drink, and that which is below her navel is sprinkled.
Abdullah said: I saw my father write for a woman in a basin (ijana) or something clean, and so on to the end.
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah نقل this statement in (Majmu' al-Fatawa).
So it is understood from what he transmitted that it is written for a woman in a clean vessel; then she is given to drink and that which is below her navel is sprinkled with it, in order to facilitate childbirth; and he transmitted it from Ahmad. So is this act sound?

P6806b - The answer
This isnad is not authentic from Ibn Abbas so long as it contains Muhammad ibn Abi Layla. As for what is reported from some of the salaf, as Ibn Taymiyyah mentioned, and likewise Ibn al-Qayyim in the book (Zad al-Ma'ad), regarding writing verses on occasions and in various situations, then it appears—and Allah knows best—that leaving that is better, because there is no evidence for it.

P6807 - What al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar meant by his stipulating soundness or hasan for what he cited from the principal musnads, jawami', and others in al-Fath

P6807a - The question
Al-Hafiz, may Allah Most High have mercy on him, said in the introduction to (Hady al-Sari): “Then I extract, secondly, what there is of a sound objective in that hadith, of the benefits pertaining to the text and the chain: completions and additions, uncovering what is obscure, an explicit statement by a mudallis of having heard, and a corroboration of one who heard from a shaykh who had become confused before that, extracting all that from the principal musnads, jawami', mustakhraj works, ajza', and fawa'id, on the condition of soundness or hasan regarding what I cite of that.”
End of quote.
So what is meant by al-Hafiz's statement: “on the condition of soundness or hasan”? Is everything al-Hafiz cited in al-Fath judged by this ruling, as is well known among students of knowledge, or is the ruling restricted to what he detailed, may Allah have mercy on him, of benefits, completions, and additions related to the hadith being explained and discussed?

P6807b - The answer
This statement is understood to mean that if he spoke about it as weak or as sound, then what he specified has been achieved; but if he was silent about it and did not mention anything, then what this statement entails is that it is sound or hasan, according to his words, may Allah Most High have mercy on him.

P6808 - Ruling on leaving a sunnah practice for the sake of winning hearts over

P6808a - The question
Is it permissible to leave a sunnah practice for the interest of da'wah, and to win hearts over?

P6808b - The answer
Winning hearts over is by following the Sunnah and calling to it, not by leaving sunnah practices in order to obtain something that he may not obtain; thus he has lost this and that.

P6809 - Ruling on greeting a woman when there is a need to speak with her

P6809a - The question
A man may be compelled to speak with a young woman about some matter from behind a veil; does he begin the conversation with salam and end it with salam?

P6809b - The answer
The beginning of speech is the salam. But speaking with a young woman or with others is only within the bounds of the intended and required purpose, such as when he calls on the telephone and a woman answers: first he gives salam, then he asks about the person, whether he is present or not present, and he ends at this limit. There should not be any drawn-out conversation, taking and giving.

P6810 - Clarifying the principle: (There is no rebuke in issues of disagreement)

P6810a - The question
What do you say about one who says that there is no rebuke regarding the issue of singing with musical instruments, and likewise the issue of acting, on the pretext that the ummah's disagreement is a mercy and by the juristic principle: there is no rebuke in issues of disagreement?

P6810b - The answer
Not every disagreement is considered. What is relied upon is the evidences, and if the evidence becomes clear and is present, then it is not permissible to oppose it. It is not permissible to abandon rebuke because someone has differed in that, because what matters is the establishment of the evidence and the manifestation of the truth, even if someone says otherwise. One does not leave the truth because there is disagreement about it. If it were the case that anything in which there is disagreement is not spoken about, then there would be no clarification of the truth. Rather, among the disputed matters are those in which the other position has no evidence for it, or it is ijtihad in the face of a text, or analogy in the face of a clear, manifest text; so clarification and explanation are necessary.

P6811 - Ruling on men beating the duff at weddings

P6811a - The question
Is it permissible for men to beat the duff in a wedding celebration?

P6811b - The answer
That is not permissible for men; rather, it is permissible only for women, because it has been reported concerning women and it has not been reported concerning men.

P6812 - Ruling on feasts before the wedding

P6812a - The question
What some people do of feasts before the marriage contract, of what is called the shabka and the like—does that count as extravagance?

P6812b - The answer
There is no doubt that it is from affectation and from things that burden the husband. Leaving these things, and sufficing with a single walimah without exaggeration in it, is what should be done.

P6813 - Extent of the soundness of the statement that Jesus, peace be upon him, will be buried beside the Prophet ﷺ

P6813a - The question
Some people say: Jesus, peace be upon him, will be buried beside the grave of the Prophet ﷺ. How sound is this statement?

P6813b - The answer
I do not know anything about its soundness.

P6814 - Meaning of the Prophet's ﷺ statement: (And I am a security for my Companions)

P6814a - The question
In a hadith from the Prophet ﷺ it says: (The stars are a security for the sky; when the stars depart, the sky will come what it has been promised; and I am a security for my Companions.) What is meant by his statement: (I am a security for my Companions)?

P6814b - The answer
Its meaning is that his presence among them was a security for them from the disagreement that occurred after his death ﷺ, and the hadith is sound and established from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ.

P6815 - Response regarding the hadith about some Companions practicing mut'ah until the time of Umar, may Allah be pleased with him

P6815a - The question
In the hadith it says: (We used to practice mut'ah for days with a handful of dates and flour during the time of the Prophet ﷺ and Abu Bakr, until Umar forbade it.) What is the response to this hadith, since it indicates that the prohibition of mut'ah was delayed?

P6815b - The answer
Ibn al-Qayyim said in (Zad al-Ma'ad fi Hady Khayr al-'Ibad), may Allah Most High have mercy on him: If it is said: What do you do with what Muslim narrated in his Sahih from Jabir ibn Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with them both, that he said: We used to practice mut'ah for days with a handful of dates and flour during the time of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him, until Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, forbade it concerning Amr ibn Harith; and with what is established from Umar that he said: Two mut'ahs were during the time of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, and I forbid them: the mut'ah of women, and the mut'ah of Hajj.
It is said: People regarding this are two groups. One group says: Umar is the one who made it unlawful and forbade it, and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ commanded following what the Rightly Guided Caliphs established. This group did not consider authentic the hadith of Sabrah ibn Ma'bad regarding the prohibition of mut'ah in the year of the Conquest; for it is from the narration of Abd al-Malik ibn al-Rabi' ibn Sabrah from his father from his grandfather, and Ibn Ma'in spoke against him. Al-Bukhari did not view it fitting to include his hadith in his Sahih despite the intense need for it and its being a foundation among the foundations of Islam; and if it had been authentic to him he would not have refrained from including it and using it as proof.
They said: If the hadith of Sabrah were authentic, it would not have been hidden from Ibn Mas'ud, may Allah be pleased with him, such that he would narrate that they did it and cite the verse as proof. Also, if it were authentic, Umar would not have said: It was during the time of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and I forbid it and punish for it; rather, he would have said: He ﷺ made it unlawful and forbade it. They said: And if it were authentic, it would not have been practiced during the time of al-Siddiq, which truly was the time of the caliphate of Prophethood.
The second group held the hadith of Sabrah to be authentic; and if it were not authentic, then the hadith of Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, is authentic, that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ prohibited the mut'ah of women. Therefore it becomes necessary to understand the hadith of Jabir as meaning that the one who reported its practice did not have the prohibition reach him, and it had not become widespread until the time of Umar, may Allah be pleased with him. When dispute about it occurred, its prohibition became manifest and widespread; and thus the hadiths narrated regarding it are reconciled. And with Allah is the granting of success.
This clarifies what is meant: that it reaches them, and after that it became widespread and manifest in the time of Umar, may Allah be pleased with him and grant him His pleasure. Something similar to this is the hadith of A'ishah, may Allah Most High be pleased with her: (Among what was revealed of the Quran were ten known sucklings that make unlawful; then they were abrogated by five known; and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ passed away while they were among what was recited of the Quran) even though they were abrogated. But because the time was near, some people after the death of the Messenger ﷺ would recite them and did not know of the abrogation. So this is of this type, as Ibn al-Qayyim said.

P6816 - Ruling on the guardian stipulating for the husband that he not marry over his ward

P6816a - The question
May the woman's guardian stipulate in the contract that the husband not marry another wife besides his daughter?

P6816b - The answer
There is no harm in that, because he wants that his daughter not be harmed and that nothing occur that harms her. Whoever does not want this should seek someone else; the matter is broad. But what is blameworthy is that a woman already exists and then another woman comes and stipulates the divorce of the existing one who has obtained provision and good. As for what is mentioned in the question, there is no harm in it.

P6817 - Ruling on preventing the suitor from looking at his fiancée

P6817a - The question
We have a custom in which we do not allow the suitor to look at the woman he is proposing to, and if he requests it we prevent him. Is there any sin upon us?

P6817b - The answer
As for the occurrence of sin, I do not know of it. Looking is not obligatory, and the Prophet's ﷺ statement: (If you are able to look) indicates that there can be a marriage without looking.

P6818 - An advisory word to students of knowledge during the vacation days

P6818a - The question
In view of the end of studies for this year, and the fact that all the students are returning to their countries, we hope for your guidance to the students in calling to Allah, Glorified and Exalted.

P6818b - The answer
This vacation is an opportunity for a person to seize and benefit from, and not let it be wasted without benefit. That is by doing whatever he can do that returns to him with good and returns to others with good: through reading and study and reading some beneficial, useful books; or undertaking calling to Allah, Mighty and Majestic, and calling to good; or teaching some people who are in need of being taught, so he teaches them the matters of their religion and gives them understanding in them. This is from calling to Allah, Mighty and Majestic, because calling to Allah is by teaching and it is by reminding: it is for people whom he teaches and for people whom he reminds. All of that is from calling to Allah, Mighty and Majestic. What is important is that a person benefit from the vacation and not waste the opportunity on himself without using it in what returns to him and to others with good.
If a person does not have the ability to call to Allah, Mighty and Majestic, and to teach others, then at the very least he should read some beneficial, useful books, such as the book (I'lam al-Muwaqqi'in) by Ibn al-Qayyim. It is a precious book containing tremendous knowledge, and mentioning principles in the Shari'ah and the wisdoms of legal rulings; it contains fundamentals and it contains branches. Likewise, the book (Zad al-Ma'ad fi Hady Khayr al-'Ibad) is a great book. If he reads books like these and he comes out of the vacation having read books like these, then he has come out with profit and benefit. If he does not train himself to do such work, then the vacation will end and he will not have gained anything in it and will not have obtained anything of consequence, because he has missed the opportunity for himself. But if he resolves from the outset to strive and benefit from the break, then he will obtain and benefit, without it being wasted upon him pointlessly without benefit. This is a brief piece of advice that I would like to say on this occasion.

P6819 - Stance toward the book al-Asas fi al-Tafsir and its author

P6819a - The question
What is your view of the book al-Asas fi al-Tafsir by Sa'id Hawwa, and what is your view of its author?

P6819b - The answer
I do not know the book, but I know that the author of the book is confused and mixed up, and it is not suitable that anything from his books be read because of what they contain of confusion. A person should read reliable books and beneficial books from which he comes out with benefit, such as the two books that I pointed to: (I'lam al-Muwaqqi'in) and (Zad al-Ma'ad); and such as the tafsir of Shaykh Ibn Sa'di. If a person wants to read a reliable tafsir and a clear tafsir, which he can read and complete with clear, plain expressions, then he should adhere to the tafsir of Shaykh Abd al-Rahman ibn Sa'di, may Allah have mercy on him. It is a valuable and great tafsir, suitable for the general public and specialists, because its expressions are clear, understood by both specialist and layman. It does not contain: “it was said such and such, and it was said such and such, and it was said such and such,” for these are things that may confuse the general public. Rather, its expressions are clear and plain: it analyzes the verses and clarifies their meanings with clear, plain, comprehensible expressions. So the reader should read authors who are free from confusion, who are people of knowledge, and not people of new methodologies that deviate from the straight path.

P6820 - What is to be done after a shighar marriage done in ignorance

P6820a - The question
If two people marry by way of shighar while being ignorant of the ruling, are they separated?

P6820b - The answer
If mutual acceptance and harmony are present, then the contract is renewed.

P6821 - The time of looking at the woman being proposed to

P6821a - The question
Is looking at the woman being proposed to before the proposal, or after it?

P6821b - The answer
Some of the people of knowledge said: it is before the proposal. When he resolves to propose to her, he looks at her before he proposes to her. They said: if he proposes to her and then sees her after that, he may not desire her; and this is only by way of hiding. As for by way of requesting, there is no way to see her except that he be a suitor.

P6822 - Sharh Sunan Abi Dawud [240]
Marriage is among the greatest matters that Islam has regulated, and it has made it a fortress for preserving honor and limiting the spread of indecencies. The Shari'ah has stipulated, in marriage, that it issue from the woman's guardian, and it has invalidated the marriage if it was without the guardian's permission.

P6823 - Guardianship in marriage

P6824 - Explanation of the hadith: (Any woman who marries without the permission of her guardians, then her marriage is invalid)
The compiler, may Allah Most High have mercy on him, said: [Chapter on the guardian.
Muḥammad ibn Kathīr narrated to us; Sufyān informed us; Ibn Jurayj informed us, from Sulaymān ibn Mūsā, from al-Zuhrī, from ʿUrwah, from ʿĀʾishah, may Allah be pleased with her, who said: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: (Any woman who marries without the permission of her guardians, then her marriage is invalid—three times. If he consummates with her, then the mahr is hers for what he has taken from her; and if they dispute, then the ruler is the guardian of one who has no guardian.)].
Imam Abu Dawud al-Sijistani, may Allah Most High have mercy on him, says: [Chapter on the guardian].
Meaning: the guardian who undertakes concluding the marriage contract between a man and a woman. It is necessary that she have a guardian who undertakes that. She does not undertake it herself, and neither does a stranger to her, who is not among her guardians, undertake it, except by authorization from the guardian. Guardianship in marriage existed in al-Jahiliyyah, as has come in Sahih al-Bukhari from A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, that in al-Jahiliyyah a man would come to a man and propose his ward from him, and he would marry her to him. Thus this ruling, which is the necessity of a guardian in marriage, is among the matters that existed in al-Jahiliyyah and Islam affirmed them.

P6825 - The wisdom in considering the guardian in marriage and the evidences for stipulating it in the Book and the Sunnah
It is known that the Sunnah of the Messenger ﷺ is by speech, action, and approval. The Sunnah of the Messenger ﷺ came with stipulating the guardian, as in the hadith that Abu Dawud and others cited, and that also came in the Noble Quran. There also came approval of this ruling that existed in al-Jahiliyyah, and that it is among the rulings that existed and Islam affirmed.
This is something commendable, because in it is keeping the woman away from appearing by being occupied with marriage, and modesty predominates over them. Thus the Book and the Sunnah came with stipulating the guardian in marriage, and that it is necessary that a woman have a guardian who contracts the marriage for her to the one who will marry her. In the Quran there is what indicates that, in the statement of Allah, Mighty and Majestic: “So do not prevent them from marrying their husbands” [al-Baqarah: 232]. This is an address to the guardians. If a woman were able to contract for herself, or someone other than her guardians could do so, then there would have been no need to forbid the guardians from prevention when they prevent them from marrying their husbands.
The verse was revealed regarding Ma'qil ibn Yasar, may Allah be pleased with him. He had a sister whom he married off to a relative of his; then he divorced her. When her waiting period ended, he came to propose to her, and Ma'qil swore that he would not marry her to him. That reached the Prophet ﷺ, and the verse was revealed: “So do not prevent them from marrying their husbands,” meaning those who divorced them and whose waiting period ended.
As for if he divorced her while she was still in the waiting period, then the matter belongs to the husband, because he has the right of return. But if the woman exits the waiting period, he becomes one suitor among the suitors: if she wishes to return to him, her guardian does not prevent her from that; and if she wishes not to accept him and she desires another person besides him, then she may do so.
So this noble verse contains a forbiddance to the guardians from prevention (adl), which is their refusal to marry off the divorced husbands when the women are pleased with those husbands who divorced them. The guardian is thus required to contract for her with the husband who divorced her, whose waiting period ended, and who wants to marry her again. The verse is clear in indicating that guardianship is necessary, because if it were not necessary there would have been no need to forbid them; rather, she would dispose of her own affair if the matter belonged to her.
The Sunnah of the Messenger ﷺ also contains hadiths that Abu Dawud cited in this chapter; he cited hadiths indicating that a guardian is necessary in marriage. He first cited the hadith of the Mother of the Believers A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, that the Prophet ﷺ said: (Any woman who marries without the permission of her guardians, then her marriage is invalid—three times), meaning that he said: invalid, invalid, invalid. He repeated that for emphasis. He said: (If he consummates with her, then the mahr is hers for what he has taken from her; and if they dispute, then the ruler is the guardian of one who has no guardian.)
The Messenger of Allah's ﷺ statement: (Any woman who marries without the permission of her guardians, then her marriage is invalid) indicates that guardianship is a condition in marriage, and that if the contract is concluded without a guardian then it is invalid. A woman's concluding the marriage contract for herself, or authorizing someone to conclude it for her, while she is the one who undertakes that without the permission of the guardians, is invalid, as the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said. The wording is general: the meaning is that any woman for whom that happens without a guardian, the marriage is invalid and void, as though it did not exist, because it lacked this condition, namely the guardian in marriage.
What is meant by his statement: (the permission of her guardians) is that they conclude the contract or permit someone to conclude it; that is, either the guardian concludes it himself, or he permits someone to conclude it on his behalf.
The intent is that the marriage is not valid unless it is through a guardian or an agent of a guardian. It is not meant that a woman may marry herself off with her guardian's permission, because she does not have guardianship in concluding the marriage contract for herself.
The guardian is the one among her agnatic relatives, the nearest then the nearest: the father, then the grandfather, then the son, then the son's son, then the full brother, then the brother by the father, then the full brother's son, then the brother-by-father's son, then the full paternal uncle, then the paternal uncle by the father, then the full paternal uncle's son, then the paternal uncle-by-father's son, and so on according to the order. Those other than the agnates are not guardians: neither uterine relatives nor those who inherit by fixed shares, such as maternal brothers.
The guardian who undertakes the contract must be adult. Ascendants are given precedence over others, descendants are given precedence over collateral relatives. If the lower guardian concludes the contract while the higher exists, it is valid if the higher approves it. If the one entitled to it relinquishes it to one below him, the contract is valid.

P6826 - Invalidating the contract that is devoid of a guardian
Then he said: (If he consummates with her), meaning: if he enters upon her by this contract that is not sound, (then the mahr is hers for what he has taken from her), meaning: what he gave her as a mahr is not returned to him so long as he has taken her and had intercourse with her, because it is hers in exchange for what he made lawful of her private part.
If the guardians dispute—meaning that they differ or they prevent—then guardianship transfers to the ruler: (the ruler is the guardian of one who has no guardian). This also indicates that the woman has no right to conclude the marriage contract, since the Shari'ah has placed that right with the guardians, then it transfers to the ruler and does not transfer to her. The matter returns to the guardians; then if they do not exist, or they exist but are preventing and refusing to fulfill her wish and marry her to one who is fit to marry her, then that matter transfers to the ruler, due to his statement: (If they dispute, then the ruler is the guardian of one who has no guardian)."""

Removing truncations and ensuring full translation
I realized I need to remove the Arabic letters "نقل" and replace them with “transmitted.” Also, many parts of the translation are incomplete because I used ellipses as placeholders. I’ll go through each area systematically, expanding the truncated sections with the full translation. This will be a large text, but I'll ensure it’s thorough and accurate. Time to tackle it bit by bit!

Filling in the placeholders with full translation
I noticed that the translation has several placeholder ellipses throughout multiple segments (like P6806a, P6807a, etc.), which need to be filled. Instead of relying on existing drafts, I’ll rebuild the translation from scratch using the original text as a reference, ensuring it’s complete and detailed. Let’s tackle it step by step.

Translating specific segments
For segment P6806a, after the chain, there’s a statement from Ibn Abbas that I need to translate fully. It includes a combination of verses and phrases, such as "In the name of Allah...". I’ll complete the translation for this segment accordingly. Similarly, in P6807a, I'll properly translate the full quoted sentence and remove placeholders. For P6810b, I’ll also provide the complete translation without truncations. Let’s make sure each part is full and accurate.

Completing translation for long segments
For P6815b, I'll fully translate the entire quote and provide the final commentary. It's a substantial section, so I'll ensure all content is included. P6818b will be split into two full paragraphs and will also include book recommendations. For P6819b, I’ll avoid confusion and mention tafsir by Abd al-Rahman ibn Sa'di as suitable for both general audiences and specialists. In P6824, I'll complete the quote about Bukhari with the necessary translation. I'll continue systematically and handle all truncated lines. Let's get a full version of the translation, ensuring no placeholders are left.

P6806 - حكم كتابة بعض الآيات في إناء لتسقى بمائه من تعسرت ولادتها

P6806a - السؤال
قال شيخ الإسلام ابن تيمية رحمه الله تعالى: ويجوز أن يكتب للمصاب وغيره من المرضى شيء من كتاب الله وذكره بالمداد المباح، ويغسل ويسقى كما نص على ذلك أحمد وغيره، قال عبد الله ابن الإمام أحمد: قرأت على أبي: حدثنا يعلى بن عبيد حدثنا سفيان عن محمد بن أبي ليلى عن الحكم عن سعيد بن جبير عن ابن عباس رضي الله عنهما قال: إذا عسر على المرأة ولادتها فليكتب: (باسم الله، لا إله إلا الله الحليم الكريم، سبحان الله رب العرش العظيم، {الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ} [الفاتحة: ٢]، {كَأَنَّهُمْ يَوْمَ يَرَوْنَهَا لَمْ يَلْبَثُوا إِلَّا عَشِيَّةً أَوْ ضُحَاهَا} [النازعات: ٤٦]، {كَأَنَّهُمْ يَوْمَ يَرَوْنَ مَا يُوعَدُونَ لَمْ يَلْبَثُوا إِلَّا سَاعَةً مِنْ نَهَارٍ بَلاغٌ فَهَلْ يُهْلَكُ إِلَّا الْقَوْمُ الْفَاسِقُونَ} [الأحقاف: ٣٥].
قال أبي: حدثنا أسود بن عامر بإسناده بمعناه، وقال: يكتب في إناء نظيف فيسقى.
قال أبي: وزاد فيه وكيع: فتسقى، وينضح ما دون سرتها.
قال عبد الله: رأيت أبي يكتب للمرأة في إجان أو شيء نظيف إلى آخره.
نقل هذا الكلام شيخ الإسلام ابن تيمية في (مجموع الفتاوى).
فعلم مما نقله أنه يكتب للمرأة في إناء نظيف فتسقى وينضح به ما دون سرتها؛ لأجل تيسير الولادة، ونقله عن أحمد، فهل يصح هذا الفعل؟

P6806b - الجواب
هذا الإسناد غير صحيح عن ابن عباس ما دام أن فيه محمد بن أبي ليلى، وأما ما جاء عن بعض السلف كما ذكر ابن تيمية وكذلك ابن القيم في كتاب (زاد المعاد) في كتابة آيات في مناسبات وفي أحوال متعددة فيبدو -والله أعلم- أن ترك ذلك هو الأولى؛ لأنه لا دليل عليه.

P6807 - مراد الحافظ ابن حجر باشتراطه الصحة أو الحسن فيما نقله من أمهات المسانيد والجوامع وغيرها في الفتح

P6807a - السؤال
قال الحافظ رحمه الله تعالى في مقدمة (هدي الساري): ثم أستخرج ثانياً ما يتعلق به غرض صحيح في ذلك الحديث من الفوائد المتنية والإسنادية من تتمات وزيادات، وكشف غامض، وتصريح مدلس بسماع، ومتابعة سامع من شيخ اختلط قبل ذلك، منتزعاً كل ذلك من أمهات المسانيد والجوامع والمستخرجات والأجزاء والفوائد بشرط الصحة أو الحسن فيما أورده من ذلك.
اهـ.
فما مراد الحافظ بقوله: بشرط الصحة أو الحسن، فهل كل ما أورده الحافظ في الفتح يحكم عليه بهذا الحكم كما هو مشتهر بين طلبة العلم أم أن الحكم مقتصر على ما فصله رحمه الله من فوائد وتتمات وزيادات متعلقة بالحديث المشروح والمتكلم عليه؟

P6807b - الجواب
هذا الكلام يفهم منه أنه إذا تكلم عليه بضعف أو بصحة فقد حصل المقصود بكلامه المحدد، ولكنه إذا سكت عنه ولم يذكر شيئاً فمقتضى هذا الكلام أنه يكون صحيحاً أو حسناً على حسب كلامه رحمه الله تعالى.

P6808 - حكم ترك المسنون لتأليف القلوب

P6808a - السؤال
هل يجوز ترك المسنون لمصلحة الدعوة، ولتأليف القلوب؟

P6808b - الجواب
تأليف القلوب يكون باتباع السنة والدعوة إليها، وليس بترك السنن من أجل أن يحصَّل شيئاً وقد لا يحصله، فيكون بذلك قد خسر هذا وهذا.

P6809 - حكم السلام على المرأة حال الحاجة إلى تكليمها

P6809a - السؤال
الرجل قد يضطر إلى أن يتكلم مع المرأة الشابة لأمر من الأمور من وراء حجاب، فهل يبدأ الحديث بالسلام ويختمه بالسلام؟

P6809b - الجواب
بداية الكلام هو السلام، لكن الكلام مع الشابة أو مع غير الشابة إنما يكون في حدود المقصود والمطلوب، مثل أن يتصل بالهاتف فترد امرأة، فأولاً يسلم، ثم يسأل عن الشخص هل هو موجود أو غير موجود؟ وينتهي عند هذا الحد، ولا يكون هناك استرسال في الكلام أخذاً وعطاءً.

P6810 - توضيح القاعدة: (لا إنكار في مسائل الخلاف)

P6810a - السؤال
ما قولكم فيمن يقول بأنه لا إنكار في مسألة الغناء بالموسيقى، وكذلك مسألة التمثيل بحجة أن اختلاف الأمة رحمة وبالقاعدة الفقهية: لا إنكار في مسائل الخلاف؟

P6810b - الجواب
ليس كل خلاف يكون معتبراً، والمعول عليه هي الأدلة، وإذا اتضح الدليل وكان موجوداً فلا تجوز مخالفته، ولا يجوز ترك الإنكار من أجل أن هناك من خالف في ذلك؛ لأن المعتبر هو ثبوت الدليل وظهور الحق ولو قال بخلافه من قال، فإنه لا يترك الحق من أجل أن فيه خلافاً، ولو كان الأمر أن كل شيء فيه خلاف لا يتكلم فيه لما كان هناك بيان للحق، بل المسائل الخلافية منها ما يكون القول الآخر ليس عليه دليل، أو هو اجتهاد في مقابل نص، أو قياس في مقابل نص واضح جلي، فلابد من الإيضاح والبيان.

P6814b - الجواب
معناه أن وجوده بينهم أمنة لهم من الخلاف الذي حصل بعد وفاته صلى الله عليه وسلم، والحديث صحيح ثابت عن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم.

P6815 - الجواب عن حديث تمتع بعض الصحابة إلى عهد عمر رضي الله عنه

P6815a - السؤال
جاء في الحديث: (كنا نستمتع بالقبضة من التمر والدقيق الأيام على عهد النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم وأبي بكر حتى نهى عنه عمر)، فما الجواب عن هذا الحديث؛ إذ إنه يدل على أن المتعة تأخر النهي عنها؟

P6815b - الجواب
قال ابن القيم في (زاد المعاد في هدي خير العباد رحمه الله تعالى: فإن قيل: فما تصنعون بما رواه مسلم في صحيحه عن جابر بن عبد الله رضي الله عنهما أنه قال: كنا نستمتع بالقبضة من التمر والدقيق الأيام على عهد رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم وأبي بكر رضي الله عنه حتى نهى عنها عمر رضي الله عنه في شأن عمرو بن حريث، وفيما ثبت عن عمر أنه قال: متعتان كانتا على عهد رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم أنا أنهى عنهما: متعة النساء، ومتعة الحج.
قيل: الناس في هذا طائفتان: طائفة تقول: إن عمر هو الذي حرمها ونهى عنها، وقد أمر رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم باتباع ما سنه الخلفاء الراشدون، ولم تر هذه الطائفة تصحيح حديث سبرة بن معبد في تحريم المتعة عام الفتح، فإنه من رواية عبد الملك بن الربيع بن سبرة عن أبيه عن جده، وقد تكلم فيه ابن معين، ولم ير البخاري إخراج حديثه في صحيحه مع شدة الحاجة إليه، وكونه أصلاً من أصول الإسلام، ولو صح عنده لم يصبر عن إخراجه والاحتجاج به.
قالوا: ولو صح حديث سبرة لم يخف على ابن مسعود رضي الله عنه حتى يروي أنهم فعلوها ويحتج بالآية، وأيضاً ولو صح لم يقل عمر: إنها كانت على عهد رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم وأنا أنهى عنها وأعاقب عليها، بل كان يقول: إنه صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم حرمها ونهى عنها، قالوا: ولو صح لم تفعل على عهد الصديق وهو عهد خلافة النبوة حقاً.
والطائفة الثانية رأت صحة حديث سبرة، ولو لم يصح فقد صح حديث علي رضي الله عنه أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم حرم متعة النساء، فوجب حمل حديث جابر على أن الذي أخبر عنها بفعلها لم يبلغه التحريم، ولم يكن قد اشتهر حتى كان زمن عمر رضي الله عنه، فلما وقع فيها النزاع ظهر تحريمها واشتهر، وبهذا تأتلف الأحاديث الواردة فيها، وبالله التوفيق.
وهذا يوضح المقصود، وأنه يبلغهم، وبعد ذلك اشتهر وظهر في عهد عمر رضي الله عنه وأرضاه، ويشبه هذا حديث عائشة رضي الله تعالى عنها: (كان فيما أنزل من القرآن عشر رضعات معلومات يحرمن، فنسخن بخمس معلومات، فتوفي رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم وهن فيما يقرأ من القرآن) مع أنهن منسوخة، ولكن لقرب العهد كان بعض الناس بعد وفاة الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم يقرءونها ولم يعلموا بالنسخ، فهذا من هذا القبيل كما قال ابن القيم.

P6816 - حكم اشتراط الولي على الزوج ترك الزواج على موليته

P6816a - السؤال
هل لولي المرأة أن يشترط في العقد ألا يتزوج الزوج على ابنته؟

P6816b - الجواب
لا بأس بذلك؛ لأنه يريد أن بنته لا تضار ولا يحصل لها يضرها، والإنسان الذي لا يريد هذا الشيء عليه أن يبحث عن غيرها، والأمر فيه سعة، ولكن المحذور هو أن تكون المرأة موجودة ثم تأتي امرأة وتشترط طلاق الموجودة التي حصل لها رزق وخير، وأما ما ذكر في السؤال فلا بأس به.

P6817 - حكم منع الخاطب من النظر إلى مخطوبته

P6817a - السؤال
عندنا عادة وهي أننا لا نسمح للخاطب أن ينظر إلى المخطوبة، وإذا طلب نمنعه، فهل علينا شيء من الإثم؟

P6817b - الجواب
حصول الإثم لا أعلم به، والنظر ليس بلازم، وقول النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم: (إن استطعت أن تنظر) يدل على أنه يمكن أن يكون زواج بدون نظر.

P6818 - كلمة توجيهية لطلبة العلم في أيام الإجازة

P6818a - السؤال
نظراً لانتهاء الدراسة لهذا العام وكون كل الطلبة يرجعون إلى بلدانهم نرجو توجيهكم للطلبة في الدعوة إلى الله جل وعلا؟

P6818b - الجواب
إن هذه الإجازة فرصة على الإنسان أن يغتنمها ويستفيد منها، وألا تضيع عليه بدون فائدة، وذلك بأن يفعل ما يمكنه فعله مما يعود عليه بالخير ومما يعود على غيره بالخير، وذلك بالقراءة والمطالعة وقراءة بعض الكتب النافعة المفيدة، أو القيام بالدعوة إلى الله عز وجل والدعوة إلى الخير، أو تدريس بعض الناس الذين هم بحاجة إلى تدريسه، فيعلمهم أمور دينهم ويفقههم فيها، وهذا من الدعوة إلى الله عز وجل؛ لأن الدعوة إلى الله تكون بالتعليم وتكون بالتذكير، وتكون لأناس يعلمهم ولأناس يذكرهم، فكل ذلك من الدعوة إلى الله عز وجل، فالمهم في الأمر أن الإنسان يستفيد من الإجازة، وألا يضيع الفرصة على نفسه دون أن يستغلها فيما يعود عليه وعلى غيره بالخير.
وإذا كان الإنسان ليس عنده إمكانٌ أن يقوم بالدعوة إلى الله عز وجل وأن يعلم غيره فلا أقل من أن يقرأ بعض الكتب النافعة والمفيدة مثل كتاب (إعلام الموقعين) لـ ابن القيم، وهو كتاب نفيس مشتمل على علم عظيم، وعلى ذكر قواعد في الشريعة، وعلى حكم الأحكام الشرعية، وهو مشتمل على أصول وعلى فروع، وكذلك أيضاً كتاب (زاد المعاد في هدي خير العباد)، فهو كتاب عظيم، فإذا قرأ مثل هذه الكتب وخرج من الإجازة وقد قرأ مثل هذه الكتب فإنه يكون قد خرج بربح وفائدة، وإذا لم يوطن نفسه على أن يعمل مثل هذا العمل فإن الإجازة ستنتهي ولم يربح فيها شيئاً ولم يحصَّل فيها طائلاً؛ لأنه فوت الفرصة على نفسه، ولكنه إذا عقد العزم من أول الأمر على أن يجتهد ويستفيد من العطلة فإنه سيحصل وسيستفيد دون أن تضيع عليه سدىً بلا فائدة، هذه نصيحة مختصرة أحب أن أقولها في هذه المناسبة.

لا أعرف الكتاب، لكن أعرف أن صاحب الكتاب مخلط، وأنه لا يصلح أن يقرأ شيء من كتبه لما فيها من التخليط، وعلى الإنسان أن يقرأ الكتب المأمونة والكتب النافعة التي يخرج منها بفائدة، مثل الكتابين اللذين أشرت إليهما: كتاب (إعلام الموقعين) و (زاد المعاد)، ومثل تفسير الشيخ ابن سعدي، فالإنسان إذا أراد أن يقرأ تفسيراً مأموناً وتفسيراً واضحاً يمكنه أن يقرأه ويكمله وهو بعبارات واضحة، جلية فعليه بتفسير الشيخ عبد الرحمن بن سعدي رحمه الله، فهو تفسير قيم وعظيم يصلح للعامة والخاصة؛ لأنه بعبارات واضحة يفهمها الخاص والعام، فليس فيه: (قيل كذا وقيل كذا وقيل كذا)، فهذه أشياء قد تشوش على العامة، فإن عباراته واضحة جلية، فهو يحلل الآيات ويبين معانيها بعبارات واضحة جلية مفهومة، فعلى القارئ أن يقرأ لأناس عندهم سلامة من التخليط، ويكونون أهل علم وليسوا أهل مناهج جديدة منحرفة عن الجادة.

Continuing translation work from P6820 onward
I'll move forward with opening the remaining segments from P6820, starting with P6820b, and continue through to P6824 and beyond. I’ve already handled P6826 earlier. The goal is to ensure I’m including each part fully in the translation, addressing everything with clarity and thoroughness. Let’s proceed step by step.

P6821 - وقت النظر إلى المخطوبة

P6821a - السؤال
هل النظر إلى المخطوبة يكون قبل الخطبة أم بعدها؟

P6821b - الجواب
قال بعض أهل العلم: إنه يكون قبل الخطبة، فإذا عزم على أن يخطبها فإنه ينظر إليها قبل أن يخطبها، وقالوا: إنه لو خطبها ثم رآها بعد ذلك فقد لا يرغب فيها، وهذا لا يكون إلا عن طريق الاختباء، وأما عن طريق الطلب فلا سبيل إلى رؤيتها إلا أن يكون خاطباً.

P6822 - شرح سنن أبي داود [٢٤٠]
الزواج من أعظم الأمور التي ضبطها الإسلام، وجعلها حصناً لحفظ الأعراض والحد من انتشار الفواحش، وقد اشترط الشرع في الزواج أن يصدر من ولي المرأة، وأبطل النكاح إذا كان بغير إذن الولي.

P6823 - الولاية في النكاح

P6824 - شرح حديث (أيما امرأة نكحت بغير إذن مواليها فنكاحها باطل)
قال المصنف رحمه الله تعالى: [باب في الولي.
حدثنا محمد بن كثير أخبرنا سفيان أخبرنا ابن جريج عن سليمان بن موسى عن الزهري عن عروة عن عائشة رضي الله عنها قالت: قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم: (أيما امرأة نكحت بغير إذن مواليها فنكاحها باطل -ثلاث مرات- فإن دخل بها فالمهر لها بما أصاب منها، فإن تشاجروا فالسلطان ولي من لا ولي له)].
يقول الإمام أبو داود السجستاني رحمه الله تعالى: [باب في الولي].
أي: الولي الذي يتولى عقد النكاح للزوج على امرأة، فإنه لابد من وجود ولي لها يتولى ذلك، ولا تتولى هي ذلك بنفسها، ولا يتولاه أجنبي عنها ليس من مواليها إلا بتوكيل من الولي، والولاية في النكاح كانت موجودة في الجاهلية، كما جاء في صحيح البخاري عن عائشة رضي الله عنها أنهم كانوا في الجاهلية يأتي الرجل إلى الرجل فيخطب وليته منه فيزوجها إياه، فكان هذا الحكم الذي هو لزوم الولي في النكاح من الأمور التي كانت في الجاهلية وأقرها الإسلام.

P6825 - الحكمة في اعتبار الولي في النكاح وأدلة اشتراطه في الكتاب والسنة
ومعلوم أن سنة الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم تكون بالقول والفعل والتقرير، وقد جاءت سنة رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم باشتراط الولي كما في الحديث الذي أورده أبو داود وغيره، وجاء ذلك في القرآن الكريم أيضاً، وجاء أيضاً التقرير لهذا الحكم الذي كان في الجاهلية، وأنه من الأحكام التي كانت موجودة وأقرها الإسلام.
وهو شيء محمود؛ لأن في ذلك إبعاد المرأة عن الظهور بالاشتغال بالزواج والحياء يغلب عليهن، فكان أن جاء الكتاب والسنة باشتراط الولي في النكاح، وأنه لابد من ولي للمرأة يعقد النكاح لها على من يتزوجها، وقد جاء في القرآن الكريم ما يدل على ذلك، وذلك في قول الله عز وجل: {فَلا تَعْضُلُوهُنَّ أَنْ يَنكِحْنَ أَزْوَاجَهُنَّ} [البقرة: ٢٣٢]، وهو خطاب للأولياء، فلو كانت المرأة يمكنها أن تعقد لنفسها أو يقوم بذلك أحد من غير أوليائها لما كان هناك حاجة إلى أن ينهى الأولياء عن العضل، حين يعضلونهن أن ينكحن أزواجهن، وذلك أن الآية نزلت في معقل بن يسار رضي الله عنه، وكان له أخت زوجها من قريب لها ثم طلقها، ولما انتهت عدتها جاء يخطبها، فحلف معقل أن لا يزوجها إياه، فبلغ ذلك النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم فنزلت الآية: {فَلا تَعْضُلُوهُنَّ أَنْ يَنكِحْنَ أَزْوَاجَهُنَّ} أي: الذين طلقوهن وانتهت عدتهن.
أما إذا كان طلقها وهي باقية في العدة فالأمر إلى الزوج؛ لأن له حق الرجعة، ولكنه إذا خرجت المرأة من العدة صار خاطباً من الخطاب إن شاءت أن تعود إليه فوليها لا يمنعها من ذلك، وإن شاءت أن لا تقبله ورغبت في شخص آخر سواه فإن لها ذلك.
فهذه الآية الكريمة فيها نهي الأولياء عن العضل، وهو امتناعهم عن أن يزوجوا الأزواج المطلقين إذا رضيت النساء بهؤلاء الأزواج الذين طلقوهن، فيلزم الولي بأن يعقد لها على زوجها الذي طلقها وانتهت عدتها وأراد أن يتزوجها مرة أخرى، فالآية واضحة الدلالة على أن الولاية لازمة؛ لأنها لو لم تكن لازمة لما كان هناك حاجة إلى أن ينهوا، بل هي تتصرف في نفسها لو كان الأمر إليها، وسنة الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم جاء فيها من الأحاديث ما أورده أبو داود في هذا الباب، فقد أورد أحاديث تدل على أنه لابد من الولي في النكاح.
فأورد أولاً حديث أم المؤمنين عائشة رضي الله عنها وأرضاها أن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم قال: [(أيما امرأة نكحت بغير إذن مواليها فنكاحها باطل -ثلاث مرات-)] أي أنه قال: باطل، باطل، باطل.
كرر ذلك للتأكيد، قال: (فإن دخل بها فلها المهر بما أصاب منها، فإن تشاجروا فالسلطان ولي من لا ولي له)].
فقول الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم: (أيما امرأة نكحت بغير إذن مواليها فنكاحها باطل)] يدل على أن الولاية شرط في النكاح، وأن العقد إذا عقد من غير ولي فإنه يكون باطلاً، وكون المرأة تعقد لنفسها أو توكل أحداً يعقد لها وهي التي تتولى ذلك بغير إذن الموالي فإنه يكون باطلاً كما قال ذلك رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم، وهو يدل على العموم، والمعنى أن أي امرأة حصل لها ذلك بغير ولي فإن النكاح يكون باطلاً، ويكون لاغياً كأنه لم يكن؛ لأنه فقد هذا الشرط الذي هو الولي في النكاح.
والمقصود بقوله: [(إذن مواليها)] كونهم يعقدون أو يأذنون لأحد أن يعقد، أي: إما أن يعقد الولي بنفسه أو يأذن لأحد أن يعقد نيابة عنه.
فالمقصود به أن النكاح لا يصح إذا لم يكن من ولي أو وكيل لولي، وليس المقصود به أن المرأة لها أن تزوج نفسها بإذن وليها؛ لأنها ليست لها الولاية في عقد الزواج لنفسها.
والولي هو الذي يكون من عصبتها الأولى فالأولى، أي: الأب، ثم الجد، ثم الابن، ثم ابن الابن، ثم الأخ الشقيق، ثم الأخ لأب، ثم ابن الأخ الشقيق، ثم ابن الأخ لأب، ثم العم الشقيق، ثم العم لأب، ثم ابن العم الشقيق، ثم ابن العم لأب، وهكذا على حسب الترتيب، وغير العصبة لا يكونون أولياء، لا ذوو الأرحام ولا الذين يرثون بالفرض كالإخوة لأم.
ولابد في الولي الذي يتولى العقد من البلوغ، ويقدم الأصول على غيرهم، ويقدم الفروع على الحواشي، ولو عقد الولي الأدنى مع وجود الأعلى صح إذا أقره، فإذا تنازل من له الحق لمن هو دونه صح العقد.

P6826 - إبطال العقد الخالي عن الولي
ثم قال: [(فإن دخل بها)] يعني: إن دخل عليها بهذا العقد الذي هو غير صحيح [(فلها المهر بما أصاب منها)] يعني: هذا الذي دفعه لها مهراً لا يرجع إليه ما دام أنه أصابها وجامعها؛ لأن لها ذلك بما استحل من فرجها.
وإذا اشتجر الأولياء -بمعنى أنهم اختلفوا أو عضلوا- فإن الولاية تنتقل إلى السلطان [(فالسلطان ولي من لا ولي له)]، وهذا يدلنا -أيضاً- على أن المرأة لا حق لها في عقد النكاح؛ إذ جعل الشرع الحق في ذلك للأولياء، ثم تنتقل للسلطان ولا تنتقل إليها، فالأمر يرجع إلى الأولياء، ثم إن كانوا لا يوجدون أو يوجدون ولكنهم عاضلون وممتنعون من تحقيق رغبتها وتزويجها بمن هو أهل للزواج منها فإن ذلك الأمر ينتقل إلى السلطان، لقوله: [(فإن اشتجروا فالسلطان ولي من لا ولي له)].
Translating full Arabic sections accurately
I’ve now got all the Arabic sections, so I’ll start translating them completely. This includes P6806a, with the Bismillah and verse references, P6807a, and P6815b which also has the concluding commentary. P6818b, P6819b, and P6824 are next. I’ll use ALA-LC for names and make sure to replace Arabic digits with Western digits where needed.

Finalizing translation and names consistency
I’ll adjust the translation so it uses plain text with straight quotes or parentheses, avoiding curly quotes. I’ll preserve IDs and fully translate all segments, removing Arabic words like "نقل" in favor of "This statement was transmitted by..." when necessary. I'll use ALA-LC for names in the isnad like "Yaʿlā ibn ʿUbayd" and "Aswad ibn ʿĀmir," but leave "Ahmad" without special transliteration since he's not in the chain.

Refining final translation and script checks
I'll ensure technical terms like mahr (dower), 'iddah (waiting period), raj'ah (revocation), 'adl (prevention), and wali are correctly used, with no Arabic script except ﷺ (which is allowed as U+FDFA). I will review the final string in Python, check for Arabic characters and numerals, and ensure U+FDFA is the only exception.

His statement: [Musaddad narrated to us from ʿAbd al-Wāḥid ibn Ziyād].
ʿAbd al-Wāḥid ibn Ziyād is trustworthy; the compilers of the Six Books narrated from him.
[Muḥammad ibn Isḥāq narrated to us].
Muḥammad ibn Isḥāq has been mentioned previously.

Dāwūd ibn Ḥuṣayn is trustworthy; the compilers of the Six Books narrated from him.
[from Wāqid ibn ʿAbd al-Raḥmān].
He is Wāqid ibn ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ibn Saʿd ibn Muʿādh, and it says in (Tuhfat al-Ashraf): what is known is that he is Wāqid ibn ʿAmr ibn Saʿd ibn Muʿādh.
Al-Hafiz said: its men are trustworthy, and Ibn al-Qattan declared it defective due to Wāqid ibn ʿAbd al-Raḥmān, and said: what is known is Wāqid ibn ʿAmr; and the narration of al-Hakim has: Wāqid ibn ʿAmr, and likewise the narration of al-Shafi'i and Abd al-Razzaq.
And in (Tuhfat al-Ashraf): thus it was said, Wāqid ibn ʿAbd al-Raḥmān, and what is known is Wāqid ibn ʿAmr ibn Saʿd ibn Muʿādh. The wording of al-Hakim in al-Mustadrak supports it, but al-Mizzi distinguished between the two in his Tahdhib, and he increased the distinction between them and emphasized it, and al-Hafiz also affirmed it in (Tahdhib al-Tahdhib) as well.
This was stated by Shaykh al-Albani.
And Wāqid ibn ʿAmr ibn Saʿd ibn Muʿādh is trustworthy; Muslim, Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi, and al-Nasa'i narrated from him.
[from Jābir ibn ʿAbd Allāh, may Allah Most High be pleased with them both] has been mentioned previously.

P6802 - Questions

P6803 - Jābir, may Allah be pleased with him, hiding in order to see the woman he intended to propose to: was that in his first marriage?
In the hadith, Jābir was hiding to see the one he wanted to marry; so is she the one the Prophet ﷺ asked him about when he said: (Have you married? He said: Yes. He said: A virgin or a previously married woman? He said: A previously married woman, O Messenger of Allah ﷺ!), or is it the story of another marriage of Jābir?

P6803a - The answer
There is nothing indicating that she was the same woman, so it could have been her or someone else.

P6804 - What may be looked at of the body of the woman being proposed to

P6804a - The question
What is it that may be looked at of the woman being proposed to? Is it permissible to look at other than the face and the two hands?

P6804b - The answer
He looks only at the two hands and the face, and he does not go beyond that. There is disagreement: some scholars say he may look at her hair, and some hold that looking at more than that is permissible, and this is what is transmitted from Ibn Hazm.

P6805 - Ruling on seeking permission from a woman's paternal cousins when intending to marry her

P6805a - The question
Among some tribes, whoever intends to marry a woman must seek permission from her paternal cousins; what is the ruling on this?

P6805b - The answer
This is from the matters of al-Jahiliyyah; her paternal cousins do not own her, and they have no right to prevent her from marrying whom she wants.

P6806 - Ruling on writing some verses in a vessel so that the one whose childbirth is difficult may be given its water to drink

P6806a - The question
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah, may Allah Most High have mercy on him, said: It is permissible to write, for the afflicted person and others among the sick, something from the Book of Allah and His remembrance with permissible ink, and it is washed and drunk, as Ahmad and others stated. Abdullah the son of Imam Ahmad said: I read to my father: Yaʿlā ibn ʿUbayd narrated to us; Sufyān narrated to us; from Muḥammad ibn Abī Laylā; from al-Ḥakam; from Saʿīd ibn Jubayr; from Ibn ʿAbbās, may Allah be pleased with them both, who said: If childbirth becomes difficult for a woman, then let him write:
(In the name of Allah. There is no deity but Allah, the Forbearing, the Generous. Glory be to Allah, Lord of the Mighty Throne. All praise is for Allah, Lord of the worlds [al-Fatihah: 2]. As if, on the day they see it, they had not remained except an evening or its forenoon [al-Nazi'at: 46]. As if, on the day they see what they are promised, they had not remained except an hour of a day. A conveyance (of the message); so shall any be destroyed except the defiantly disobedient people [al-Ahqaf: 35].)
My father said: Aswad ibn ʿĀmir narrated to us, with his chain, with its meaning; and he said: It is written in a clean vessel and then she is given to drink.
My father said: And Wakīʿ added in it: then she is given to drink, and that which is below her navel is sprinkled.
Abdullah said: I saw my father write for a woman in a basin (ijana) or something clean, and so on to the end.
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah transmitted this statement in (Majmu' al-Fatawa).
So it is understood from what he transmitted that it is written for a woman in a clean vessel; then she is given to drink, and that which is below her navel is sprinkled with it, in order to facilitate childbirth; and he transmitted it from Ahmad. So is this act sound?

P6806b - The answer
This chain is not authentic from Ibn Abbas so long as it contains Muhammad ibn Abi Layla. As for what is reported from some of the salaf, as Ibn Taymiyyah mentioned, and likewise Ibn al-Qayyim in the book (Zad al-Ma'ad), regarding writing verses on occasions and in various situations, then it appears—and Allah knows best—that leaving that is better, because there is no evidence for it.

P6807 - What al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar meant by his stipulating soundness or hasan for what he cited from the major musnads, jawami', and others in al-Fath

P6807a - The question
Al-Hafiz, may Allah Most High have mercy on him, said in the introduction to (Hady al-Sari): Then I extract, secondly, what relates to that hadith, for a valid purpose, of the benefits of the text and the chain: completions and additions, uncovering what is obscure, an explicit statement by a mudallis of hearing, and a corroboration by one who heard from a shaykh who had become confused before that, extracting all of that from the major musnads, jawami', mustakhraj works, ajza', and fawa'id, on the condition of soundness or hasan in what I mention of that.
End of quote.
So what is meant by al-Hafiz's statement: on the condition of soundness or hasan? Is everything al-Hafiz cited in al-Fath judged by this ruling, as is well known among students of knowledge, or is the ruling restricted to what he detailed, may Allah have mercy on him, of benefits, completions, and additions related to the hadith being explained and discussed?

P6807b - The answer
This is understood to mean that if he spoke about it as weak or as sound, then what he specified has been achieved; but if he was silent about it and did not mention anything, then what this statement entails is that it is sound or hasan, according to his words, may Allah Most High have mercy on him.

P6808 - Ruling on leaving a sunnah practice for the sake of winning hearts over

P6808a - The question
Is it permissible to leave a sunnah practice for the interest of da'wah, and to win hearts over?

P6808b - The answer
Winning hearts over is by following the Sunnah and calling to it, not by leaving sunnah practices in order to obtain something that he may not obtain; thus he has lost this and that.

P6809 - Ruling on greeting a woman when there is a need to speak with her

P6809a - The question
A man may be compelled to speak with a young woman about some matter from behind a veil; does he begin the conversation with salam and end it with salam?

P6809b - The answer
The beginning of speech is the salam. But speaking with a young woman or with others is only within the bounds of the intended and required purpose, such as when he calls on the telephone and a woman answers: first he gives salam, then he asks about the person, whether he is present or not present, and he ends at this limit. There should not be any drawn-out conversation, taking and giving.

P6810 - Clarifying the principle: (There is no rebuke in issues of disagreement)

P6810a - The question
What do you say about one who says that there is no rebuke regarding the issue of singing with musical instruments, and likewise the issue of acting, on the pretext that the ummah's disagreement is a mercy and by the juristic principle: there is no rebuke in issues of disagreement?

P6810b - The answer
Not every disagreement is considered. What is relied upon is the evidences, and if the evidence becomes clear and is present, then it is not permissible to oppose it. It is not permissible to abandon rebuke because there is someone who differed in that, because what matters is the establishment of the evidence and the manifestation of the truth, even if someone says otherwise. One does not leave the truth because there is disagreement about it. If the matter were that anything in which there is disagreement is not spoken about, there would be no clarification of the truth. Rather, among disputed issues are those in which the other view has no evidence, or it is ijtihad in opposition to a text, or analogy in opposition to a clear, manifest text; so clarification and explanation are necessary.

P6811 - Ruling on men beating the duff at weddings

P6811a - The question
Is it permissible for men to beat the duff in a wedding celebration?

P6811b - The answer
That is not permissible for men; rather, it is permissible only for women, because it has been reported concerning women and it has not been reported concerning men.

P6812 - Ruling on feasts before the wedding

P6812a - The question
What some people do of feasts before the marriage contract, of what is called the shabka and the like—does that count as extravagance?

P6812b - The answer
There is no doubt that it is affectation and among the things that burden the husband. Leaving these things and sufficing with a single walimah without exaggeration in it is what should be done.

P6813 - Extent of the soundness of the statement that Jesus, peace be upon him, will be buried beside the Prophet ﷺ

P6813a - The question
Some people say: Jesus, peace be upon him, will be buried beside the grave of the Prophet ﷺ. How sound is this statement?

P6813b - The answer
I do not know anything about its soundness.

P6814 - Meaning of the Prophet's ﷺ statement: (And I am a security for my Companions)

P6814a - The question
In a hadith from the Prophet ﷺ it says: (The stars are a security for the sky; when the stars depart, the sky will come what it has been promised; and I am a security for my Companions.) What is meant by his statement: (I am a security for my Companions)?

P6814b - The answer
Its meaning is that his presence among them was a security for them from the disagreement that occurred after his death ﷺ, and the hadith is sound and established from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ.

P6815 - Response regarding the hadith about some Companions practicing mut'ah until the time of Umar, may Allah be pleased with him

P6815a - The question
In the hadith it says: (We used to practice mut'ah for days with a handful of dates and flour during the time of the Prophet ﷺ and Abu Bakr, until Umar forbade it.) What is the response to this hadith, since it indicates that the prohibition of mut'ah was delayed?

P6815b - The answer
Ibn al-Qayyim said in (Zad al-Ma'ad fi Hady Khayr al-'Ibad), may Allah Most High have mercy on him: If it is said: What do you do with what Muslim narrated in his Sahih from Jabir ibn Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with them both, that he said: We used to practice mut'ah with a handful of dates and flour for days during the time of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him, until Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, forbade it concerning Amr ibn Harith; and with what is established from Umar that he said: Two mut'ahs were during the time of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ; I forbid them: the mut'ah of women and the mut'ah of Hajj.
It is said: People regarding this are two groups. One group says: Umar is the one who made it unlawful and forbade it. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ commanded following what the Rightly Guided Caliphs established. This group did not consider authentic the hadith of Sabrah ibn Ma'bad regarding the prohibition of mut'ah in the year of the Conquest, for it is from the narration of Abd al-Malik ibn al-Rabi' ibn Sabrah from his father from his grandfather. Ibn Ma'in spoke against him, and al-Bukhari did not deem it fit to include his hadith in his Sahih despite the severe need for it and its being a foundation from the foundations of Islam; and had it been authentic with him, he would not have refrained from including it and using it as proof.
They said: If the hadith of Sabrah were authentic, it would not have been hidden from Ibn Mas'ud, may Allah be pleased with him, such that he would narrate that they did it and cite the verse as proof. Also, if it were authentic, Umar would not have said: It was during the time of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and I forbid it and punish for it; rather, he would have said: He ﷺ made it unlawful and forbade it. They said: And if it were authentic, it would not have been practiced during the time of al-Siddiq, and that truly was the time of the caliphate of Prophethood.
The second group held the hadith of Sabrah to be authentic, and if it were not authentic, then the hadith of Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, is authentic, that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ prohibited the mut'ah of women. Therefore, it becomes necessary to understand the hadith of Jabir as meaning that the one who reported its practice did not have the prohibition reach him, and it had not become widespread until the time of Umar, may Allah be pleased with him. When dispute about it occurred, its prohibition became manifest and widespread, and through this the hadiths narrated concerning it are harmonized. And Allah is the One who grants success.
This clarifies what is meant, and that it reaches them; and after that it became widespread and manifest in the time of Umar, may Allah be pleased with him and grant him His pleasure.
Something similar to this is the hadith of A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her: (Among what was revealed of the Quran were ten known sucklings that make unlawful; then they were abrogated by five known, and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ passed away while they were among what was recited of the Quran), even though they were abrogated. But because the time was near, some people after the death of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ would recite them and did not know of the abrogation. So this is of this type, as Ibn al-Qayyim said.

P6816 - Ruling on the guardian stipulating for the husband that he not marry over his ward

P6816a - The question
May the woman's guardian stipulate in the contract that the husband not marry another wife besides his daughter?

P6816b - The answer
There is no harm in that, because he wants that his daughter not be harmed and that nothing occur that harms her. The person who does not want this should seek someone else; the matter is broad. But what is blameworthy is that a woman already exists and then another woman comes and stipulates the divorce of the existing one who has obtained provision and good. As for what is mentioned in the question, there is no harm in it.

P6817 - Ruling on preventing the suitor from looking at his fiancée

P6817a - The question
We have a custom in which we do not allow the suitor to look at the woman he is proposing to, and if he requests it we prevent him. Is there any sin upon us?

P6817b - The answer
As for the occurrence of sin, I do not know of it. Looking is not obligatory, and the Prophet's ﷺ statement: (If you are able to look) indicates that there can be a marriage without looking.

P6818 - An advisory word to students of knowledge during the vacation days

P6818a - The question
In view of the end of studies for this year, and the fact that all the students are returning to their countries, we hope for your guidance to the students in calling to Allah, Exalted is He.

P6818b - The answer
This vacation is an opportunity for a person to seize and benefit from, and not let it be wasted without benefit. That is by doing whatever he can do that returns to him with good and returns to others with good: through reading and study and reading some beneficial, useful books; or undertaking calling to Allah, Mighty and Majestic, and calling to good; or teaching some people who are in need of being taught, so he teaches them the matters of their religion and gives them understanding in them. This is part of calling to Allah, Mighty and Majestic, because calling to Allah is by teaching and it is by reminding: there are people whom he teaches, and people whom he reminds. All of that is calling to Allah, Mighty and Majestic. The important matter is that a person benefits from the vacation and does not waste the opportunity, without using it in what returns to him and to others with good.
If a person does not have the ability to call to Allah, Mighty and Majestic, and to teach others, then at the very least he should read some beneficial, useful books, such as the book (I'lam al-Muwaqqi'in) by Ibn al-Qayyim. It is a precious book containing tremendous knowledge, mentioning principles in the Shari'ah and the wisdoms of legal rulings; it contains fundamentals and branches. Likewise, the book (Zad al-Ma'ad fi Hady Khayr al-'Ibad) is a great book. If he reads books like these and comes out of the vacation having read them, then he will have come out with profit and benefit. If he does not train himself to do this kind of work, the vacation will end and he will not have gained anything in it and will not have obtained much, because he wasted the opportunity on himself. But if from the beginning he resolves to strive and benefit from the vacation, he will attain and benefit without it being wasted, futile and without benefit. This is a brief advice that I love to say on this occasion.

P6819 - Stance toward the book al-Asas fi al-Tafsir and its author

P6819a - The question
What is your view of the book al-Asas fi al-Tafsir by Sa'id Hawwa, and what is your view of its author?

P6819b - The answer
I do not know the book, but I know that the author of the book is confused and mixed up, and it is not suitable that anything from his books be read because of what they contain of confusion. A person should read reliable books and beneficial books from which he comes out with benefit, such as the two books that I pointed to: (I'lam al-Muwaqqi'in) and (Zad al-Ma'ad), and such as the tafsir of Shaykh Ibn Sa'di.
If a person wants to read a reliable tafsir and a clear tafsir that he can read and complete, and whose expressions are clear and plain, then he should read the tafsir of Shaykh Abd al-Rahman ibn Sa'di, may Allah have mercy on him. It is a valuable and great tafsir, suitable for the general public and for specialists, because it is in clear expressions understood by both specialist and layman. It does not contain: “It was said such-and-such, and it was said such-and-such, and it was said such-and-such.” These are things that can confuse the general public. His expressions are clear and plain; he analyzes the verses and clarifies their meanings in clear, plain, understandable expressions.
A reader should read from people who are safe from confused mixture, people of knowledge, not people of new methodologies deviating from the straight path.

P6820 - What is to be done after a shighar marriage done in ignorance

P6820a - The question
If two people marry by way of shighar while being ignorant of the ruling, are they separated?

P6820b - The answer
If mutual acceptance and harmony are present, then the contract is renewed.

P6821 - The time of looking at the woman being proposed to

P6821a - The question
Is looking at the woman being proposed to before the proposal, or after it?

P6821b - The answer
Some of the people of knowledge said: it is before the proposal. If he resolves to propose to her, then he looks at her before he proposes to her. They said: if he proposes to her and then sees her after that, he may not desire her. This can only be by way of hiding. As for by way of request, there is no way to see her unless he is a suitor.

P6822 - Sharh Sunan Abi Dawud [240]
Marriage is among the greatest matters that Islam has regulated and made it a fortress for preserving honor and limiting the spread of indecencies. The Shari'ah has stipulated, in marriage, that it issue from the woman's guardian, and it has invalidated the marriage if it is without the permission of the guardian.

P6823 - Guardianship in marriage

P6824 - Explanation of the hadith: (Any woman who marries without the permission of her guardians, then her marriage is invalid)
The compiler, may Allah Most High have mercy on him, said: [Chapter on the guardian.
Muḥammad ibn Kathīr narrated to us; Sufyān informed us; Ibn Jurayj informed us, from Sulaymān ibn Mūsā, from al-Zuhrī, from ʿUrwah, from ʿĀʾishah, may Allah be pleased with her, who said: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: (Any woman who marries without the permission of her guardians, then her marriage is invalid—three times. If he consummates with her, then the mahr is hers for what he has taken from her. If they dispute, then the ruler is the guardian of one who has no guardian.)].
Imam Abu Dawud al-Sijistani, may Allah Most High have mercy on him, says: [Chapter on the guardian].
Meaning: the guardian who undertakes the marriage contract between a husband and a woman. It is necessary that she have a guardian who undertakes that. She does not undertake it herself, and neither does a stranger to her, who is not among her guardians, undertake it, except by deputization from the guardian. Guardianship in marriage existed in al-Jahiliyyah, as has come in Sahih al-Bukhari from A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, that in al-Jahiliyyah a man would come to a man and propose his ward to him, and he would marry her off to him. So this ruling—namely, the necessity of a guardian in marriage—was among the matters that existed in al-Jahiliyyah and Islam affirmed it.

P6825 - The wisdom in considering the guardian in marriage and the evidences for stipulating it in the Book and the Sunnah
It is known that the Sunnah of the Messenger ﷺ is by speech, action, and approval. The Sunnah of the Messenger ﷺ has come with stipulating the guardian, as in the hadith that Abu Dawud and others cited. That also came in the Noble Quran, and there also came approval of this ruling that existed in al-Jahiliyyah, and that it is among the rulings that existed and Islam affirmed.
This is something commendable, because it keeps the woman away from appearing by being occupied with marriage, and modesty predominates over them. Thus the Book and the Sunnah came with stipulating the guardian in marriage, and that it is necessary that a woman have a guardian who contracts the marriage for her to the one who will marry her.
In the Quran there is what indicates that, in the statement of Allah, Mighty and Majestic: “So do not prevent them from marrying their husbands” [al-Baqarah: 232]. This is an address to the guardians. If the woman could conclude the contract for herself, or someone other than her guardians could do it, there would be no need to forbid the guardians from prevention when they prevent them from marrying their husbands.
This is because the verse was revealed regarding Ma'qil ibn Yasar, may Allah be pleased with him. He had a sister whom he married off to a relative of his; then he divorced her. When her waiting period ended, he came to propose to her, so Ma'qil swore that he would not marry her to him. That reached the Prophet ﷺ, so the verse was revealed: “So do not prevent them from marrying their husbands,” meaning those who divorced them and whose waiting period ended.
As for when he divorced her while she was still in the waiting period, then the matter belongs to the husband, because he has the right of return. But when the woman exits the waiting period, he becomes one suitor among the suitors. If she wishes to return to him, her guardian does not prevent her from that; and if she wishes not to accept him, and she desires another person besides him, then she may do so.
So this noble verse contains a forbiddance to the guardians from prevention, which is their refusal to marry off the divorced husbands when the women are pleased with these husbands who divorced them. The guardian is thus required to contract for her with her husband who divorced her, whose waiting period ended, and who wants to marry her again. The verse is clear in indicating that guardianship is required, because if it were not required there would be no need to forbid them; rather, she would dispose of her own affair if the matter were up to her.
The Sunnah of the Messenger ﷺ also contains hadiths that Abu Dawud cited in this chapter. He cited hadiths indicating that a guardian is necessary in marriage.
He first cited the hadith of the Mother of the Believers A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her and grant her His pleasure, that the Prophet ﷺ said: (Any woman who marries without the permission of her guardians, then her marriage is invalid—three times), meaning that he said: invalid, invalid, invalid. He repeated that for emphasis. He said: (If he consummates with her, then the mahr is hers for what he has taken from her. If they dispute, then the ruler is the guardian of one who has no guardian.)
The Messenger of Allah's ﷺ statement: (Any woman who marries without the permission of her guardians, then her marriage is invalid) indicates that guardianship is a condition in marriage, and that if the contract is concluded without a guardian then it is invalid. If the woman concludes the contract for herself, or authorizes someone to conclude it for her, while she is the one who undertakes that without the permission of the guardians, then it is invalid, as the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said. The wording indicates generality: any woman for whom that occurs without a guardian, her marriage is invalid and void, as though it had not occurred, because it is missing this condition, namely the guardian in marriage.
What is meant by his statement: (the permission of her guardians) is that they conclude the contract or permit someone to conclude it; that is, either the guardian concludes it himself or he permits someone to conclude it on his behalf.
So the intent is that the marriage does not become valid unless it is through a guardian or an agent of a guardian. The intent is not that a woman may marry herself off with her guardian's permission, because she does not have guardianship in concluding her own marriage contract.
The guardian is the one among her agnatic relatives, the nearest then the nearest: the father, then the grandfather, then the son, then the son's son, then the full brother, then the brother by the father, then the full brother's son, then the brother-by-father's son, then the full paternal uncle, then the paternal uncle by the father, then the full paternal uncle's son, then the paternal uncle-by-father's son, and so on according to the order. Those other than the agnates are not guardians: neither uterine kin (dhu al-arham) nor those who inherit by fixed shares, such as brothers from the mother.
The guardian who undertakes the contract must be adult. Ascendants are given precedence over others, and descendants are given precedence over collateral relatives. If the lower guardian concludes the contract while the higher exists, it is valid if the higher approves it. If the one entitled to it relinquishes it to one below him, then the contract is valid.

P6826 - Invalidating the contract that is devoid of a guardian
Then he said: (If he consummates with her), meaning: if he enters upon her by this contract that is not valid, (then the mahr is hers for what he has taken from her), meaning: what he gave her as a mahr is not returned to him so long as he has taken her and had intercourse with her, because she is entitled to it in exchange for what he made lawful of her private part.
If the guardians dispute—meaning that they differ or they prevent—then guardianship transfers to the ruler: (the ruler is the guardian of one who has no guardian). This also indicates that the woman has no right to conclude the marriage contract, since the Shari'ah has placed that right with the guardians; then it transfers to the ruler and does not transfer to her. The matter returns to the guardians; then if they do not exist, or they exist but are preventing and refusing to fulfill her wish and marry her to one who is suitable to marry her, then that matter transfers to the ruler, due to his statement: (If they dispute, then the ruler is the guardian of one who has no guardian)."""

Correcting the truncation of the chain
It looks like the text was unintentionally truncated when I used the "..." placeholder. The chain statement should've included "al-Ḥakam," "Saʿīd," and "Ibn ʿAbbās," but the text cut off, showing only "from al..." followed by "If childbirth..." without those missing parts. I'll make sure to fix this and restore the full translation.

Identifying a possible character issue
I see "al..." in the output, which is three dots, but full.count("...") returns 0. That suggests it's not the same triple dot character, possibly a different Unicode character like "…". I need to inspect the slice between "al" and "If" to see what’s actually there. Let’s check the string representation.

Verifying the truncation and checking for patterns
Oh, the earlier issue was just due to Jupyter's UI truncating the string, not actual placeholders. I mistakenly thought it was a string issue, but it was just a visual representation with ellipsis.

Revisiting the use of ellipses in the string
I see that the "..." in the repr is not from truncation but actually inserted into the string. It reflects the placeholder I typed earlier ("mercy on him, said: I read to my father: Yaʿlā..."), showing where I intentionally placed the ellipsis as part of the string. The slice includes this accurately.

Clarifying the presence of ellipses
It looks like the "..." inside the string isn't from truncation. I printed the first 500 characters, so the ellipsis must be part of the actual data. However, my earlier regex didn’t pick up the triple dots. This means those "..." are actually inserted into the string, not due to any compression by Python.

Investigating the dot characters in the string
I’m wondering if the dots are not the usual period ('.') but instead something like '…' (ellipsis character). However, since the repr displays '...', it likely means they are actual periods. To investigate, I’ll check the code points around the ellipsis and use regex to locate any non-period characters in the line.

Identifying ellipsis and character code points
line = lines[i]
# find any characters that look like periods by filtering those with unicode category 'Po' maybe.
dots = [(j, ch, ord(ch)) for j,ch in enumerate(line) if ch not in "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789 ,;:-()[]'\"/"]

Okay, it looks like the triple dot ("...") actually exists as periods ('.') in the string. So that matches what I saw earlier with the output. There's no need to worry about any strange characters after all. Just confirming that the periods are properly represented in the text.

Investigating ellipsis characters
It looks like the string is showing "mercy ...s," but the regex doesn't find a triple dot ("..."), and count shows no triple dot sequences. So, it could be that the "..." is actually a single ellipsis character (U+2026). I'll check the character codepoints around that pattern to confirm.

Checking for ellipsis character encoding
# locate the unusual ellipsis area between "mercy" and "s among"

Diagnosing the strange output formatting
The issue with the output seems to be that the environment is misrepresenting the character sequence. The tuple showing as 'i...d' might be caused by combining characters or a ligature. I'll print the codepoints for the section around the ellipsis and display the full line from indices 0 to 150 with unicode_escape to check if that clears things up.

Investigating possible discrepancies in character encoding
I'm seeing that "..." is appearing literally, but unicode_escape doesn't show any special escape like '\u2026', which would indicate an ellipsis. Line count doesn’t match expectations either, returning 0 for "...". I'll check the ord values for these characters to verify if they’re truly dots or another glyph like "·".

Checking the encoding behind the dots
It looks like encode('unicode_escape') of '…' correctly yields '\u2026', so it's not a U+2024 character after all. Maybe the three dots are something different, like U+2024, which could have been truncated earlier. I’ll take the substring after "on" and print the codepoints to analyze the characters, checking the ord values for the dots.

Exploring truncation in display
It seems like the issue with the ellipsis is related to Jupyter’s display, rather than the actual data. The snippet “on... write” isn’t there in the data itself — it’s likely just a visual truncation due to the display width. When printing, the data shows as expected, no alterations.

Clarifying the byte slice and ellipsis origin
I think the ellipsis might actually be in the string itself, not due to truncation by Jupyter. When I used encode('unicode_escape')[:400], I got the exact bytes, and the '...' was present in the output. If the string had been truncated, it wouldn't have displayed those dots.

Clarifying ellipses and truncation
It looks like the "perm...write" issue was just UI truncation, not actual ellipses in the text. There don't appear to be any real ellipses in the text, although I used them as placeholders in places like "marry ...". The earlier search confirms that I didn't actually type any triple dots.

Checking sentence endings
I did end some sentences with "..." but maybe I used a special character like a single ellipsis (‘…’) instead of three dots. The earlier regex didn’t find any, which suggests I might not have used triple dots after all. Let’s check the last 20 lines to verify how I ended those sentences.

P6824 - Explanation of the hadith: (Any woman who marries without the permission of her guardians, then her marriage is invalid)
The compiler, may Allah Most High have mercy on him, said: [Chapter on the guardian.
Muḥammad ibn Kathīr narrated to us; Sufyān informed us; Ibn Jurayj informed us, from Sulaymān ibn Mūsā, from al-Zuhrī, from ʿUrwah, from ʿĀʾishah, may Allah be pleased with her, who said: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: (Any woman who marries without the permission of her guardians, then her marriage is invalid—three times. If he consummates with her, then the mahr is hers for what he has taken from her. If they dispute, then the ruler is the guardian of one who has no guardian.)].
Imam Abu Dawud al-Sijistani, may Allah Most High have mercy on him, says: [Chapter on the guardian].
Meaning: the guardian who undertakes the marriage contract between a husband and a woman. It is necessary that she have a guardian who undertakes that. She does not undertake it herself, and neither does a stranger to her, who is not among her guardians, undertake it, except by deputization from the guardian. Guardianship in marriage existed in al-Jahiliyyah, as has come in Sahih al-Bukhari from A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, that in al-Jahiliyyah a man would come to a man and propose his ward to him, and he would marry her off to him. So this ruling—namely, the necessity of a guardian in marriage—was among the matters that existed in al-Jahiliyyah and Islam affirmed it.

P6825 - The wisdom in considering the guardian in marriage and the evidences for stipulating it in the Book and the Sunnah
It is known that the Sunnah of the Messenger ﷺ is by speech, action, and approval. The Sunnah of the Messenger ﷺ has come with stipulating the guardian, as in the hadith that Abu Dawud and others cited. That also came in the Noble Quran, and there also came approval of this ruling that existed in al-Jahiliyyah, and that it is among the rulings that existed and Islam affirmed.
This is something commendable, because it keeps the woman away from appearing by being occupied with marriage, and modesty predominates over them. Thus the Book and the Sunnah came with stipulating the guardian in marriage, and that it is necessary that a woman have a guardian who contracts the marriage for her to the one who will marry her.
In the Quran there is what indicates that, in the statement of Allah, Mighty and Majestic: “So do not prevent them from marrying their husbands” [al-Baqarah: 232]. This is an address to the guardians. If the woman could conclude the contract for herself, or someone other than her guardians could do it, there would be no need to forbid the guardians from prevention when they prevent them from marrying their husbands.
This is because the verse was revealed regarding Ma'qil ibn Yasar, may Allah be pleased with him. He had a sister whom he married off to a relative of his; then he divorced her. When her waiting period ended, he came to propose to her, so Ma'qil swore that he would not marry her to him. That reached the Prophet ﷺ, so the verse was revealed: “So do not prevent them from marrying their husbands,” meaning those who divorced them and whose waiting period ended.
As for when he divorced her while she was still in the waiting period, then the matter belongs to the husband, because he has the right of return. But when the woman exits the waiting period, he becomes one suitor among the suitors. If she wishes to return to him, her guardian does not prevent her from that; and if she wishes not to accept him, and she desires another person besides him, then she may do so.
So this noble verse contains a forbiddance to the guardians from prevention, which is their refusal to marry off the divorced husbands when the women are pleased with these husbands who divorced them. The guardian is thus required to contract for her with her husband who divorced her, whose waiting period ended, and who wants to marry her again. The verse is clear in indicating that guardianship is required, because if it were not required there would be no need to forbid them; rather, she would dispose of her own affair if the matter were up to her.
The Sunnah of the Messenger ﷺ also contains hadiths that Abu Dawud cited in this chapter. He cited hadiths indicating that a guardian is necessary in marriage.
He first cited the hadith of the Mother of the Believers A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her and grant her His pleasure, that the Prophet ﷺ said: (Any woman who marries without the permission of her guardians, then her marriage is invalid—three times), meaning that he said: invalid, invalid, invalid. He repeated that for emphasis. He said: (If he consummates with her, then the mahr is hers for what he has taken from her. If they dispute, then the ruler is the guardian of one who has no guardian.)
The Messenger of Allah's ﷺ statement: (Any woman who marries without the permission of her guardians, then her marriage is invalid) indicates that guardianship is a condition in marriage, and that if the contract is concluded without a guardian then it is invalid. If the woman concludes the contract for herself, or authorizes someone to conclude it for her, while she is the one who undertakes that without the permission of the guardians, then it is invalid, as the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said. The wording indicates generality: any woman for whom that occurs without a guardian, her marriage is invalid and void, as though it had not occurred, because it is missing this condition, namely the guardian in marriage.
What is meant by his statement: (the permission of her guardians) is that they conclude the contract or permit someone to conclude it; that is, either the guardian concludes it himself or he permits someone to conclude it on his behalf.
So the intent is that the marriage does not become valid unless it is through a guardian or an agent of a guardian. The intent is not that a woman may marry herself off with her guardian's permission, because she does not have guardianship in concluding her own marriage contract.
The guardian is the one among her agnatic relatives, the nearest then the nearest: the father, then the grandfather, then the son, then the son's son, then the full brother, then the brother by the father, then the full brother's son, then the brother-by-father's son, then the full paternal uncle, then the paternal uncle by the father, then the full paternal uncle's son, then the paternal uncle-by-father's son, and so on according to the order. Those other than the agnates are not guardians: neither uterine kin (dhu al-arham) nor those who inherit by fixed shares, such as brothers from the mother.
The guardian who undertakes the contract must be adult. Ascendants are given precedence over others, and descendants are given precedence over collateral relatives. If the lower guardian concludes the contract while the higher exists, it is valid if the higher approves it. If the one entitled to it relinquishes it to one below him, then the contract is valid.

P6826 - Invalidating the contract that is devoid of a guardian
Then he said: (If he consummates with her), meaning: if he enters upon her by this contract that is not valid, (then the mahr is hers for what he has taken from her), meaning: what he gave her as a mahr is not returned to him so long as he has taken her and had intercourse with her, because she is entitled to it in exchange for what he made lawful of her private part.
If the guardians dispute—meaning that they differ or they prevent—then guardianship transfers to the ruler: (the ruler is the guardian of one who has no guardian). This also indicates that the woman has no right to conclude the marriage contract, since the Shari'ah has placed that right with the guardians; then it transfers to the ruler and does not transfer to her. The matter returns to the guardians; then if they do not exist, or they exist but are preventing and refusing to fulfill her wish and marry her to one who is suitable to marry her, then that matter transfers to the ruler, due to his statement: (If they dispute, then the ruler is the guardian of one who has no guardian).
Investigating sentence truncation
The output is clearly truncated by the UI, which adds ellipses for display but doesn't reflect the full text. I noticed some segments could be incomplete, especially the "on the condi..." part. But I need to check if I actually wrote it with three dots or if the UI truncated it.

Verifying truncated string segments with "condi"
# Locate "condi" occurence
pos = full.find("condi")
pos, full[pos:pos+80]

(6221,
 'condition of soundness or hasan in what I mention of that.\nEnd of quote.\nSo what')
Checking translation completeness
I can see I have the full phrase, but now I need to confirm all Arabic content is included. It looks like I started from P6801 to P6826, which matches the file. But for P6806a, I missed part of the hadith, including the phrase "If childbirth becomes difficult..." that should have been added after the chain.

Verifying missing content in translations
It looks like I missed the phrase "If childbirth becomes difficult..." in P6806a, as there's no lead-in before the part that starts with "In the name of Allah..." I need to add this. As for P6807a, it seems I didn’t truncate the quote, so that’s good. But for P6810b, I might have missed the last sentence about types of disagreements.

Verifying possible truncation in P6810b
It seems I might have truncated a part of the translation after "If the matter were that anything in which there is disagreement..." However, the full string could still be complete, but the UI may have truncated it. I’ll check the text between P6810b and P6811 to verify.

Verifying translation completeness for specific segments
# extract segment P6810b
import re
m = re.search(r"P6810b - The answer\n(.*?)\n\nP6811 -", full, re.S)
print(m.group(1))

Not every disagreement is considered. What is relied upon is the evidences, and if the evidence becomes clear and is present, then it is not permissible to oppose it. It is not permissible to abandon rebuke because there is someone who differed in that, because what matters is the establishment of the evidence and the manifestation of the truth, even if someone says otherwise. One does not leave the truth because there is disagreement about it. If the matter were that anything in which there is disagreement is not spoken about, there would be no clarification of the truth. Rather, among disputed issues are those in which the other view has no evidence, or it is ijtihad in opposition to a text, or analogy in opposition to a clear, manifest text; so clarification and explanation are necessary.
Investigating truncation and ellipsis behavior
It seems the ellipsis (...) in the output was actually part of the stored string I printed, not inserted by the UI. When printing with print(m.group(1)), it showed “the...” instead of my original text, suggesting I replaced parts of it with ellipses. I’ll check the raw representation (repr) to confirm this.

Investigating ellipsis handling in printed output
print(repr(m.group(1)))

'Not every disagreement is considered. What is relied upon is the evidences, and if the evidence becomes clear and is present, then it is not permissible to oppose it. It is not permissible to abandon rebuke because there is someone who differed in that, because what matters is the establishment of the evidence and the manifestation of the truth, even if someone says otherwise. One does not leave the truth because there is disagreement about it. If the matter were that anything in which there is disagreement is not spoken about, there would be no clarification of the truth. Rather, among disputed issues are those in which the other view has no evidence, or it is ijtihad in opposition to a text, or analogy in opposition to a clear, manifest text; so clarification and explanation are necessary.'
Clarifying the behavior of `repr()` and ellipsis
Upon reviewing, the ellipsis in repr suggests it's used by Jupyter to truncate long strings, not present as part of the original text. I realized that repr() normally shows the full string, but Jupyter might abbreviate output if it's too long. When printed, the full string should appear without truncation.

Checking possible truncation in system output
The appearance of "..." suggests the platform might be truncating long outputs automatically — not the actual text, but due to output limits. It’s possible that the group(1) content is too long. I’ll check its length to confirm whether truncation occurred, assuming this group is shorter than 200 characters.

Evaluating substring length in regex match
len(m.group(1))

802
Checking if translation is truncated
Since the segment is 802 characters long, it’s likely that printing has truncated the output. To verify whether the translation is complete, I’ll check the last 300 characters and inspect them closely. That should give me a clearer look at the full content.

Printing last 350 characters of segment content
seg = m.group(1)
print(seg[-350:])

the matter were that anything in which there is disagreement is not spoken about, there would be no clarification of the truth. Rather, among disputed issues are those in which the other view has no evidence, or it is ijtihad in opposition to a text, or analogy in opposition to a clear, manifest text; so clarification and explanation are necessary.
Verifying ellipsis in output
I printed the last 350 characters, and they include "is ..., manifest text," with an ellipsis. This seems to be part of the text rather than something truncated by the tool, as the output length isn’t too long. To confirm, I’ll search the segment for "..." and verify if it's part of the actual string.

Checking for ellipsis in segment
"..." in seg, seg.find("..."), seg[seg.find("...")-40:seg.find("...")+40]

(False, -1, '')
Checking for translation completeness
It looks like the ellipsis in the printed output wasn’t part of the string itself but was injected by the tool during elision. This could mean the translation is still incomplete. To be sure, I need to cross-check the translation against the original file and ensure full content is captured. I'll verify that each segment matches the original paragraphs fully.

Ensuring full translation coverage
I need to go through the Arabic file and check each segment to be sure the translation is complete. For example, I missed some parts in P6806a, P6807a, P6810b, and P6815b. I’ll examine and add the missing sections, such as quotes and full explanations, to ensure the translation includes everything as intended.

Completing incomplete translations
I need to finish the missing parts in P6818b, P6819b, P6824, P6825, and P6826, as the translations are incomplete. Specifically, I'll add the missing sentences like "and he comes to his country beneficial to people" and others. I'll translate directly from the Arabic file to ensure no omissions happen and craft a complete final translation.

Clarifying translation conventions for P6806a
In the translation for P6806a, I'll replace the chain translation to include Ibn Abbas' statement and full quote. I'll use ALA-LC transliteration for narrator names like "Yaʿlā ibn ʿUbayd," but leave the text itself (hadith quote) without diacritics. I'll keep "Ibn Abbas" after the chain for consistency.

Clarifying translator notes and proceeding with full translation
I'll note "ijana" for the basin and the quote from Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah in Majmu' al-Fatawa as "transmitted/quoted." For P6807a, we’ll fully translate the quote after "Hady al-Sari" while considering whether to keep or remove the quotes. I'll also work on the full translation for P6810b, ensuring careful handling of the meaning.

Translating Ibn al-Qayyim's quotation and surrounding context
The segment includes Ibn al-Qayyim’s long quote, and I need to ensure my translation covers everything, including this essential part: "هذا يوضح المراد...". I partly translated it, but I’ll complete it now. The hadith: "إن الله قد حرمها إلى يوم القيامة" translates to "Allah has made it unlawful until the Day of Resurrection," as it concerns mut'ah.

Clarifying translation for mut'ah and references
I need to note that "تستمتع" refers to mut'ah (temporary marriage), emphasized by the phrase "We used to contract mut'ah for days with a handful of dates and flour." Also, "Rightly Guided Caliphs" is correctly "al-khulafa al-rashidun." I should mention important points about authenticity and criticism from Ibn Ma'in, and Umar’s stance on mut'ah. I'll then proceed with the full translations, such as P6818b and P6819b.

Translating full segment on guardianship in marriage
I need to translate the full segment carefully. The text explains the importance of guardianship in marriage, supported by both hadith and Qur'anic verses. It discusses the conditions that require a guardian, as well as references from the Sunnah and mentions the order of guardians. I’ll ensure I fill in all incomplete sections and provide an accurate, complete translation.

Translating Arabic with ALA-LC for narrators
The user wants Arabic translated into English, while keeping certain IDs (like P6750) intact. Names of narrators in isnads should be transliterated using ALA-LC, but other names and textual content shouldn’t. I'll make sure the response follows these rules, preserving the narrators' names while maintaining clarity for the rest.

Handling names and specific terms in translation
For names outside the chain, I’ll use common English forms like Aisha or Abu Dawud. In the isnads, I’ll strictly follow the transliteration (like ʿAbd Allāh ibn Maslamah al-Qaʿnabī). For religious mentions, ‘Allah’ will be used, and terms like "sucklings" and "mussah" will be translated in their context (like "suckling" or "breastfeeding").

Translating terms and maintaining formatting
I’ll use "the suckle" and "the two suckles" for translations, and when translating hadiths like "لا تحرم المصة ولا المصتان," I’ll go with a literal translation like "The single suckle and the two suckles do not make unlawful." I’ll provide the translation in plain text, without any Arabic characters, including ﷺ, as per the user’s guidelines. Citations will appear in plain text at the end.

Translating Qur'an verse and hadith chain
For the Qur'an verse {وَأُمَّهَاتُكُمُ...}, I’ll translate it into English and include the reference (al-Nisāʾ 4:23). Arabic text will be fully translated, with brackets kept in the English version. I'll preserve the numeric markers (like P6750) and translate hadith chains, maintaining the standard structure and transliterating narrator names.

Translating narrators with ALA-LC and common names
For the narrators, I’ll use ALA-LC transliteration with macrons and diacritics like ḥ, ṣ, ṭ, etc. I'll keep common forms for names, e.g., Muḥammad, ʿAbd Allāh, Abū, while transliterating the Arabic textual sequence exactly as in the chain. For example, "القعنبي" becomes al-Qaʿnabī, and "عائشة" is ʿĀʾishah.

Translating hadith and related terms
For the hadith, I’ll translate "رضاع الكبير" as "the suckling of an adult" and "سالم مولى أبي حذيفة" as "Salim, the freedman of Abu Hudhayfah" without diacritics. For terminology like "thiqah" and "maqbūl," I'll use "trustworthy" and "acceptable," respectively. For key terms like "the compilers of the six books" or "Ibn Majah," I'll keep standard transliteration without adding diacritics to avoid confusion.

Translating hadith-related text and format considerations
For terms like "العبادلة الأربعة" I'll translate as "the four 'Abd Allahs among the Companions." For "فقهاء المدينة السبعة," it will be "the seven jurists of Madinah." I'll ensure no Arabic characters appear, using diacritics like ʿ, ā, and ī as needed. I'll follow all format guidelines, including keeping IDs and segment translations intact, but will avoid markdown and use plain text, with appropriate translations for headings, verses, and commentaries. I'll also convert Arabic numerals into English digits as needed.

Clarifying translation format and terminology
I need to ensure that all Arabic characters are replaced with English equivalents, e.g. [٢٣٨] becomes [238] and [النساء: ٢٣] becomes [al-Nisa' 4:23]. When quoting hadith, keep parentheses around the text and translate it. For ﷺ, I’ll use that symbol directly, and for "رحمه الله تعالى," I’ll translate as "may Allah Most High have mercy on him." In context, "معلومات" becomes "known" (for clear counts), and for "abrogation," I’ll specify the categories properly. I'll also handle weak hadith references correctly.

Ensuring proper ALA-LC transliteration format
For transliterations, I’ll follow ALA-LC guidelines, so I’ll use ʻ for ʿayn and ʼ for hamza (like Muḥammad). For names like 'Aisha, it will be ʻĀʼishah. I'll also ensure we avoid any markdown, keeping the response in plain text as instructed. Citations will be included at the end in plain format, like (website).

Translating and preserving diacritics throughout
I’ll transliterate names like Muʻāwiyah with the proper diacritic "ʻ." For words like "Ayyūb," I’ll use simple transliteration without using ayn. For "ḥāʾ" as a chain shift indicator, I’ll use "Ḥ" instead of Arabic letters, and provide context when needed. Also, I'll make sure there are no Arabic numerals in brackets.

Checking file length and segments
I'll review the entire file to make sure that I’m working with all the segments. This way, I'll confirm no sections have been missed or overlooked. Ensuring every part is properly included will let me give a more accurate translation. Time for a thorough inspection!

Inspecting file length and segment count
len(text), text.count('P')

(11200, 12)
Verifying all segments and IDs
I see there are 12 segments, but I also need to account for things like P6750 and other ID references. I’ll work on finding and confirming all the IDs to ensure I’m capturing everything correctly. This will make sure I’m covering all the content accurately.

Finding all IDs in text
import re
ids=re.findall(r'\n(P\d+)\s*-\s*', text)

 'P6755',
 'P6756',
 'P6757',
 'P6758',
 'P6759',
 'P6760',
 'P6761']
Translating and handling references
The segments from P6750 to P6761 need to be translated. I’ll carefully handle numeric markers like [النساء: ٢٣] and bullet references such as "شرح سنن أبي داود [٢٣٨]" to ensure they’re accurately converted. I'll leave transliteration only for names of narrators in the chain, which seem to be the focus. I'll make sure the biographical sections are separate from the actual chain.

Clarifying transliteration scope
To stay safe, I think I should follow the instruction strictly. Transliteration applies only to narrators within isnad chains (the statements about who narrated the hadith). I’ll avoid transliterating names in other parts of the text, like in biographies or commentary, since they don’t appear within an isnad chain.

Deciding on transliteration consistency
The instruction says to transliterate only the narrators’ names within the isnad chains, preserving diacritics. For biographical sections, I think I can use English forms without diacritics, as they aren't part of the chain. Although it's not strictly necessary, sticking to this approach preserves clarity and accuracy.

Transliteration and translation guidance
I’ll follow the instruction strictly: use ALA-LC diacritics for names in isnad chains and common Latin forms for other mentions like "Abdullah ibn Maslamah al-Qanabi." For references in hadith quotes, I’ll transliterate names with diacritics. For translations, “أم المؤمنين” becomes "Mother of the Believers," and similar phrases will be carefully translated accordingly.

Translating technical terms and ensuring consistency
For P6756, I'll translate "الرضخ عند الفصال" as "The gratuity at the time of weaning" since it’s a technical term. In P6757, “ghirrah” means a male or female slave, so I’ll translate it literally. Also, I’ll use "its right and obligation" for "حقه وذمامه" and ensure all technical terms are handled clearly. I'll include references as per the instructions.

Ensuring consistent translation and transliterating accurately
When crafting the translation, I’ll ensure no Arabic characters sneak in, replacing punctuation correctly. For example, replacing "؟" with "?". I'll also handle the "Sharḥ Sunan Abū Dāwūd" heading as "Explanation of Sunan Abū Dāwūd [238]". I'll use "Qaʻnabī" for transliteration, following ALA-LC. It's important to keep everything consistent and accurate throughout.

Finalizing transliterations and formatting
I'll finalize the list of transliterations, ensuring I use diacritics inside the chain whenever required. For example, "Ismāʻīl" has the 'ʻ', while names like "Hajjaj ibn Hajjaj al-Aslami" will avoid diacritics outside the chain. I'll make sure to consistently apply macrons and keep modifications in line with the user's instructions.

Preparing hadith translation with transliteration rules
import regex as re
def has_arabic(s):
    return bool(re.search(r'\p{Script=Arabic}', s))

Drafting translation manually
I’ll start the translation as a multi-line string in my analysis. It might be easier to handle manually rather than using Python code for now, and I can check for any accidental Arabic script inclusion as I go. This way, I can review everything step by step and ensure accuracy.

Crafting translation strings for Arabic script validation
translation = """P6750 - Does what is less than five sucklings make unlawful?

P6751 - Explanation of the hadith: “Among what Allah, Mighty and Majestic, sent down of the Qur’an were ten sucklings that make unlawful”
The compiler (may Allah Most High have mercy on him) said: [Chapter: Does what is less than five sucklings make unlawful?
ʻAbd Allāh ibn Maslamah al-Qaʻnabī narrated to us, from Mālik, from ʻAbd Allāh ibn Abī Bakr ibn Muḥammad ibn ʻAmr ibn Ḥazm, from ʻAmrah bint ʻAbd al-Raḥmān, from ʻĀʼishah (may Allah be pleased with her), that she said: Among what Allah, Mighty and Majestic, sent down of the Qur’an were ten sucklings that make unlawful; then they were abrogated by five known sucklings that make unlawful. Then the Prophet ﷺ passed away while they were among what was recited of the Qur’an.]

The compiler (may Allah Most High have mercy on him) said: [Chapter: Does what is less than five sucklings make unlawful. The scholars differed regarding the suckling that causes prohibition in three views:
The first view: it is that which reaches five sucklings or more. The evidence for that is this hadith which Abu Dawud cited from ʻĀʼishah (may Allah Most High be pleased with her), who said: “Among what Allah, Mighty and Majestic, sent down of the Qur’an were ten sucklings that make unlawful, then they were abrogated by five known sucklings that make unlawful; then the Prophet ﷺ passed away while they were among what was recited of the Qur’an.”
They also argued with the hadith that previously passed regarding the suckling of an adult, in which he said: “Breastfeed him five sucklings.” It is an authentic hadith, but—as has been known—it is specific to Salim, the freedman of Abu Hudhayfah. In it, the five are mentioned, so it is evidence that what is considered in suckling is what reaches five sucklings.
The second view: that what makes unlawful is three sucklings or more. They infer that from the hadith that will come, which is his statement: “A single suckle does not make unlawful, nor do two suckles.” They said: its implied meaning indicates that if it is more than that, then it makes unlawful.
The third view: that little and much suckling both make unlawful, because it has come unrestricted in some texts, such as Allah’s statement: “And your mothers who breastfed you, and your sisters through suckling” [al-Nisa’ 4:23]. It came unrestricted. They said: thus the little and the much become unlawful.
The correct and preponderant view among these is the view that what makes unlawful is five sucklings, because what indicates it has come from the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, as in this hadith that Abu Dawud cited, and the hadith that has already preceded regarding the suckling of an adult.
Abu Dawud cited here the hadith of ʻĀʼishah: “Among what Allah, Mighty and Majestic, sent down of the Qur’an were ten sucklings that make unlawful; then they were abrogated by five known sucklings that make unlawful. Then the Prophet ﷺ passed away while they were among what was recited of the Qur’an.”
Her statement: “while they” means: the five, because the pointing is to the five. There is not in the Qur’an “five sucklings make unlawful,” but in this there is an indication of the closeness of the abrogation to the death of the Messenger ﷺ, and that some people who had not received news of the abrogation continued the recitation until the abrogation reached them, due to its being close to the death of the Messenger ﷺ. So the abrogation came late.]

P6752 - Types of abrogation in the Noble Qur’an
This hadith is evidence that prohibition is only by five sucklings, and it is also evidence for two kinds among the kinds of abrogation in the Noble Qur’an. For abrogation with respect to recitation and ruling is of three divisions:
First: abrogation of both the recitation and the ruling together.
Second: abrogation of the ruling while the recitation remains.
Third: abrogation of the recitation while the ruling remains.
This hadith contains an example of two divisions: abrogation of recitation and ruling in the issue of “ten known sucklings make unlawful,” because the ruling and the recitation were abrogated: the ruling is abrogated and the recitation is abrogated.
And “five sucklings make unlawful” was such that its recitation was abrogated while the ruling remained.
An example of the third division—abrogation of the ruling while the recitation remains—is the verse about the waiting period of the woman whose husband dies being a full year, namely Allah’s statement: “And those of you who die and leave wives: a bequest for their wives, provision for a year, without expulsion” [al-Baqarah 2:240]. Its ruling is abrogated while its recitation remains, and what abrogated it is the verse before it, namely that they wait four months and ten days. Thus the divisions of abrogation with respect to recitation and ruling are three: abrogation of recitation and ruling, and abrogation of recitation with the ruling remaining, and abrogation of the ruling with the recitation remaining; and the hadith with us is a witness for the first two divisions.

P6753 - Biographies of the men of the chain of the hadith: “Among what Allah, Mighty and Majestic, sent down of the Qur’an were ten sucklings that make unlawful”

She is ʻĀʼishah, the Mother of the Believers (may Allah be pleased with her and make her pleased), the truthful one, daughter of the truthful one, and she is one of seven persons known for narrating many hadiths from the Prophet ﷺ.

P6754 - Explanation of the hadith: “A single suckle does not make unlawful, nor do two suckles”
The compiler (may Allah Most High have mercy on him) said: [Musaddad ibn Musarhad narrated to us; Ismāʻīl narrated to us, from Ayyūb, from Ibn Abī Mulaykah, from ʻAbd Allāh ibn al-Zubayr (may Allah be pleased with them both), from ʻĀʼishah (may Allah be pleased with her), that she said: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: “A single suckle does not make unlawful, nor do two suckles.”]

Abu Dawud cited the hadith of ʻĀʼishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet ﷺ said: “A single suckle does not make unlawful, nor do two suckles,” meaning: one suckling and two sucklings. This is explicitly stated here, but her statement, “then they were abrogated by five known sucklings that make unlawful,” indicates that what is less than it does not make unlawful—whether the one or the two explicitly stated in this hadith, or the third and the fourth that are not explicitly stated in the hadith—since they are below the five which came in the hadith that they make unlawful.

[From ʻĀʼishah].
Her mention has already passed.

P6756 - The gratuity at weaning

P6757 - Explanation of the hadith concerning removing the obligation of suckling by giving a ghurrah
The compiler (may Allah Most High have mercy on him) said: [Chapter: On the gratuity at weaning.
ʻAbd Allāh ibn Muḥammad al-Nufaylī narrated to us; Abū Muʻāwiyah narrated to us.
Ḥ: And Ibn al-ʻAlāʼ narrated to us; Ibn Idrīs narrated to us, from Hishām ibn ʻUrwah, from his father, from Ḥajjāj ibn Ḥajjāj, from his father (may Allah be pleased with him), that he said: I said: O Messenger of Allah! What will remove from me the reproach of suckling? He said: “A ghurrah: a male slave or a female slave.”
Al-Nufaylī said: Ḥajjāj ibn Ḥajjāj al-Aslamī.
This is its wording.]

Abu Dawud brought this chapter heading, namely: Chapter: the gratuity at weaning. The gratuity is what is given to the wet nurse when she completes the nursing, when her task ends and her connection with those for whom she breastfed ends. They give her her wage and give her a gratuity that was not agreed upon. Part of perfect kindness and proper dealings is that they honor her and present her with something beyond the wage that they agreed upon with her. This is what is meant by the gratuity: that she is given something other than what was agreed upon as her wage.
In this there is the hadith of Hajjaj ibn Hajjaj al-Aslami from his father, that he said: “O Messenger of Allah! What will remove from me the reproach of suckling?” The “reproach” of suckling is its right and its bond of obligation; what is meant is the right and the known favor that came from the wet nurse. So what will remove it from me if I do it—kindness in return for kindness? He said: “A ghurrah,” meaning: a slave, because just as she showed kindness to the child while he was small and nursed him, she is given something that removes that claim, and a person has discharged the right that is upon him.
If what is meant by it is the child who was nursed, then that would not be at weaning; rather it would only be later, meaning that if the nursling wants to show kindness, he will not show kindness except after a later time. So the gratuity at weaning is intended to be from the one who hired her—who is the child’s father, or the child’s mother, or the child’s paternal uncle, or a relative of the child. Here it is as though it suggests that what is intended is that the one who was nursed wants to show kindness to his suckling-mother and fulfill her right upon him, by giving her a male slave or a female slave to serve her, because she showed kindness to him while he was small, and she has reached what she has reached of old age. So his giving her someone who serves her and showing kindness to her in recompense for that is what is intended by the hadith.
This hadith is weak, because in its chain is Hajjaj ibn al-Hajjaj, and he is acceptable: his hadith is not used as proof unless he is corroborated, and he has no corroborator here, so the hadith is not established from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ.

So it may be that what is meant is the entire hadith, or that what is meant is that this addition is his wording.

P6759 - Explanation of Sunan Abu Dawud [238]
The Sacred Law has prevented combining a woman with her paternal aunt or her maternal aunt, because of what that contains of resentment and hatred that lead to severing ties and turning away between relatives. This is from the wisdom of the Sacred Law in blocking the avenues of corruption and evil.
It has come that Ali wanted to marry the daughter of Abu Jahl, so the Prophet ﷺ stood as a preacher and clarified that Fatimah is a part of him, and that he fears for her, from that, that she might be tried in her religion. In this too there is blocking the avenues of tribulations and corruption from the servants, let alone relatives.

P6760 - What is disliked to combine between, from women

P6761 - Explanation of the hadith: “A woman is not married alongside her paternal aunt”
The compiler (may Allah Most High have mercy on him) said: [Chapter: What is disliked to combine between, from women.
ʻAbd Allāh ibn Muḥammad al-Nufaylī narrated to us; Zuhayr narrated to us; Dāwūd ibn Abī Hind narrated to us, from ʻĀmir, from Abū Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), that he said: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: “A woman is not married alongside her paternal aunt, nor is a paternal aunt alongside her brother’s daughter; nor is a woman alongside her maternal aunt, nor is a maternal aunt alongside her sister’s daughter; and the elder is not married alongside the younger, nor the younger alongside the elder.”]

Abu Dawud brought what is disliked to be combined between from women, meaning: what is unlawful, because “disliked” among the early scholars can mean “unlawful,” as Allah Most High said: “All of that—its evil is, with your Lord, disliked” [al-Isra’ 17:38], after mentioning a number of prohibitions. So His statement “disliked” means: unlawful.
As for the jurists’ terminology, they make the disliked to be that which a prohibition has come about, but in a manner that is not decisive; it is what the one who leaves it is rewarded for, and the one who does it is not punished for; and the Lawgiver sought its abandonment in a non-decisive manner. The unlawful is what the one who leaves it is rewarded for and the one who does it is punished for, and the Lawgiver sought its abandonment decisively. So “disliked” here is in the meaning of unlawful, because combining a woman with her paternal aunt or her maternal aunt is unlawful, not disliked in the sense of being merely discouraged such that it is permissible to do it with dislike. Rather, it is forbidden, so it is not permissible to combine them. If it occurs, separation must be effected. If it occurred and then it became clear that this one is a paternal aunt or a maternal aunt, or that there was ignorance of that, then separation between them is obligatory. So the latter one who came last is left, because the contract upon the first is valid, and the contract upon the second is not valid; so the latter is left.
What is intended by this chapter heading is clarification of what is unlawful to combine between from women, and unlawful combining is only between related women between whom combining is prohibited, such as two sisters, as has come in the Qur’an: “And that you combine between two sisters—except what has already passed” [al-Nisa’ 4:23]—whether in marriage or in ownership of the right hand. Thus two sisters are not combined in marriage: if he marries one of the sisters, then her sister is not lawful for him unless he divorces her and she finishes her waiting period. Even during her waiting period it is not permissible for him to marry her sister, because a revocably divorced woman is a wife; so if he married her sister during her waiting period, he would thereby have combined between two sisters. Rather, he marries the second when the first leaves the waiting period. It is known that the waiting period is upon women, and men “observe a waiting period” in two cases that they mention as a riddle: a man observes a waiting period when he has a woman and wants to marry her sister, for he may not marry her sister until she finishes the waiting period; he himself waits out that period and does not marry her sister.
The second case is when he has four wives and wants to be rid of one and marry another in her place; he may not marry in place of the fourth until the fourth finishes her waiting period, because if he married in her place while she is in her waiting period, he would have combined between five, since the revocably divorced one is a wife. So these two situations are mentioned as riddles, and they say: the man observes a waiting period.
Likewise, in ownership of the right hand, two sisters are not combined in intercourse; as for combining between them in ownership, it is permissible, but intercourse is not permissible for him to combine between them.
And Allah’s statement, after mentioning the prohibited women by lineage, suckling, and marriage ties: “And permitted to you is what is beyond that” [al-Nisa’ 4:24] includes the permissibility of combining a woman with her paternal aunt and a woman with her maternal aunt, so the Sunnah came and exempted from that the combining of a woman with her paternal aunt and a woman with her maternal aunt.

P6750 هل يحرم ما دون خمس رضعات len 0
P6751 شرح حديث: (كان فيما أنزل الله عز وجل من القرآن عشر رضعات يحرمن)
قال المصنف رحمه الله تعالى: [باب هل يحرم ما دون خمس رضعات.
حدثنا عبد الله بن مسلمة القعنبي عن مالك عن عبد الله بن أبي بكر بن محمد بن عمرو بن حزم عن عمرة بنت عبد الرحمن عن عائشة رضي الله عنها أنها قالت: كان فيما أنزل الله عز وجل من القرآن عشر رضعات يحرمن، ثم نسخن بخمس معلومات يحرمن، فتوفي النبي صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم وهن مما يقرأ من القرآن].
قال المصنف رحمه الله تعالى: [باب هل يحرم ما دون خمس رضعات، وقد اختلف العلماء في الرضاع المحرم على ثلاثة أقوال: القول الأول: هو ما بلغ خمس رضعات فأكثر، والدليل على ذلك هذا الحديث الذي أورده أبو داود عن عائشة رضي الله تعالى عنها قالت: (كان فيما أنزل الله عز وجل من القرآن عشر رضعات يحرمن فنسخن بخمس معلومات يحرمن فتوفي النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم وهن مما يقرأ من القرآن].
واحتجوا أيضاً بالحديث الذي سبق أن مر في رضاع الكبير حيث قال فيه: (أرضعيه خمس رضعات)، وهو حديث صحيح، ولكنه -كما عرف- خاص بـ سالم مولى أبي حذيفة، وقد جاء فيه ذكر الخمس، فهو دليل على أن المعتبر في الرضاع هو ما بلغ الخمس رضعات.
القول الثاني: أن المحرم هي ثلاث رضعات فأكثر، ويستدل على ذلك بالحديث الذي سيأتي، وهو قوله: (لا تحرم المصة ولا المصتان)، قالوا: فمفهومه يدل على أنه إذا زاد على ذلك فإنه يحرم.
القول الثالث: أن الرضاع قليله وكثيره يحرم؛ لأنه جاء مطلقاً في بعض النصوص، كقوله تعالى: {وَأُمَّهَاتُكُمُ اللَّاتِي أَرْضَعْنَكُمْ وَأَخَوَاتُكُمْ مِنَ الرَّضَاعَةِ} [النساء: ٢٣]، فجاء مطلقاً، قالوا: فيحرم القليل والكثير.
والقول الصحيح والراجح من هذه الأقوال هو القول بأن المحرم هي خمس رضعات؛ لأنه قد جاء ما يدل عليه من سنة رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم كما في هذا الحديث الذي أورده أبو داود، والحديث الذي سبق أن تقدم في رضاع الكبير.
وأورد أبو داود هنا حديث عائشة [كان فيما أنزل الله عز وجل من القرآن عشر رضعات يحرمن، فنسخن بخمس معلومات يحرمن، فتوفي النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم وهن مما يقرأ من القرآن].
قوله: (وهن) أي: الخمس؛ لأن الإشارة إلى الخمس، وليس في القرآن خمس رضعات يحرمن، لكن هذا فيه إشارة إلى قرب التحريم من وفاة الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم، وأن بعض الناس الذين لم يبلغهم النسخ استمروا على القراءة حتى بلغهم النسخ، وذلك لقربه من وفاة الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم، فالنسخ جاء متأخراً. len 0
P6752 أنواع النسخ في القرآن الكريم
هذا الحديث دليل على أن التحريم إنما يكون بخمس رضعات، وهو أيضاً دليل لنوعين من أنواع النسخ في القرآن الكريم؛ لأن النسخ بالنسبة للتلاوة والحكم ثلاثة أقسام: الأول: نسخ التلاوة والحكم جميعاً.
الثاني: نسخ الحكم مع بقاء التلاوة.
الثالث: نسخ التلاوة مع بقاء الحكم.
وهذا الحديث فيه مثال لقسمين هما: نسخ التلاوة والحكم في مسألة عشر رضعات معلومات يحرمن؛ لأنه نسخ الحكم والتلاوة، فالحكم منسوخ والتلاوة منسوخة.
وخمس رضعات يحرمن نسخت فيها التلاوة وبقي الحكم.

P6757 شرح حديث بيان إذهاب مذمة الرضاعة بالغرة
قال المصنف رحمه الله تعالى: [باب في الرضخ عند الفصال.
حدثنا عبد الله بن محمد النفيلي حدثنا أبو معاوية.
ح: وحدثنا ابن العلاء حدثنا ابن إدريس عن هشام بن عروة عن أبيه عن حجاج بن حجاج عن أبيه رضي الله عنه أنه قال: قلت: يا رسول الله! ما يذهب عني مذمة الرضاعة؟ قال: (الغرة العبد أو الأمة).
قال النفيلي: حجاج بن حجاج الأسلمي.
وهذا لفظه].
أورد أبو داود هذه الترجمة، وهي [باب الرضخ عند الفصال]، والرضخ هو ما تعطاه المرضعة عند تمام الإرضاع، حيث تنتهي مهمتها وتنتهي علاقتها بمن أرضعت لهم، فيعطونها أجرتها ويرضخون لها شيئاً غير متفق عليه، فمن تمام الإحسان وتمام المعاملة أنهم يكرمونها ويتحفونها بشيء غير الأجرة التي اتفقوا معها عليها، فهذا هو المقصود بالرضخ، أي أنها تعطى شيئاً غير الذي اتفق عليه على أنه أجرة لها.
وقد جاء في هذا حديث حجاج بن حجاج الأسلمي عن أبيه أنه قال: [يا رسول الله! ما يذهب عني مذمة الرضاعة؟]، ومذمة الرضاع حقه وذمامه، والمقصود به الحق والمعروف الذي حصل من المرضعة، فما الذي يذهبه عني إذا فعلته؟ وهو إحسان في مقابل إحسان؟ قال: (غرة) يعني: عبداً؛ لأنه كما أنها قامت بالإحسان إلى الطفل في حال صغره وقامت بإرضاعه فإنها تعطى شيئاً يذهب ذلك الحق، ويكون الإنسان قد أدى الحق الذي عليه.
فإذا كان المقصود به الطفل الذي أرضع فهذا لا يكون عند الفصال، بل لا يكون إلا متأخراً، أعني إذا أراد الرضيع أن يحسن فهو لن يحسن إلا بعد زمن متأخر، فالرضخ عند الفصال يقصد به أنه من المستأجر الذي هو والد الطفل أو أم الطفل أو عم الطفل أو قريب الطفل، وهنا كأنه يشعر بأن المقصود بذلك أن الذي أرضع يريد أن يحسن إلى أمه من الرضاعة، ويؤدي لها الحق الذي عليه، وذلك بأن يعطيها عبداً أو أمة تخدمها؛ لأنها قامت بالإحسان إليه في حال صغره، وقد بلغت من الكبر ما بلغت، فكونه يعطيها من يخدمها ويقوم بالإحسان إليها مكافأة لها على ذلك هو المقصود من الحديث.
وهذا الحديث ضعيف؛ لأن في إسناده حجاج بن الحجاج، وهو مقبول لا يحتج بحديثه إلا إذا توبع، وليس له هنا متابع، فالحديث غير ثابت عن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم. len 0

P6759 شرح سنن أبي داود [٢٣٨]
لقد منع الشرع من الجمع بين المرأة وعمتها أو خالتها؛ لما في ذلك من وجود الشحناء والبغضاء التي تؤدي إلى القطيعة والتدابر بين الأقارب، وهذا من حكمة الشرع في سد أبواب الفساد والشر.
وقد جاء أن علياً أراد أن ينكح بنت أبي جهل، فقام النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم خطيباً وبين أن فاطمة بضعة منه، وأنه يخاف عليها من ذلك أن تفتن في دينها، وهذا فيه أيضاً سد أبواب الفتن والفساد على العباد بلْهَ عن الأقارب. len 0
P6760 ما يكره أن يجمع بينهن من النساء len 0
P6761 شرح حديث: (لا تنكح المرأة على عمتها)
قال المصنف رحمه الله تعالى: [باب ما يكره أن يجمع بينهن من النساء.
حدثنا عبد الله بن محمد النفيلي حدثنا زهير حدثنا داود بن أبي هند عن عامر عن أبي هريرة رضي الله عنه أنه قال: قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم: (لا تنكح المرأة على عمتها، ولا العمة على بنت أخيها، ولا المرأة على خالتها، ولا الخالة على بنت أختها، ولا تنكح الكبرى على الصغرى، ولا الصغرى على الكبرى)].
أورد أبو داود ما يكره من أن يجمع بينه من النساء، يعني: ما يحرم؛ لأن الكراهة عند المتقدمين بمعنى التحريم، كما قال تعالى: {كُلُّ ذَلِكَ كَانَ سَيِّئُهُ عِنْدَ رَبِّكَ مَكْرُوهًا} [الإسراء: ٣٨] بعد ذكر عدد من المحرمات.
فقوله تعالى (مَكْرُوهًا) أي: محرماً.
وأما في اصطلاح الفقهاء فإنهم يجعلون المكروه هو الذي جاء النهي عنه على وجه لا جزم فيه، وهو ما يثاب تاركه ولا يعاقب فاعله، وطلب الشارع تركه طلباً غير جازم، والمحرم هو ما يثاب تاركه ويعاقب فاعله، وطلب الشارع تركه طلباً جازماً، فالكراهة هنا بمعنى التحريم؛ لأن الجمع بين المرأة وعمتها وخالتها محرم وليس مكروهاً تنزيهاً بمعنى أنه يجوز أن يفعل مع الكراهة، وإنما هو ممنوع فلا يجوز الجمع، ولو حصل وجب التفريق، ولو أنه وجد ثم تبين أن هذه عمة أو خالة أو حصل جهل بذلك فإنه يجب التفريق بينهما، فتترك الأخيرة التي جاءت أخيراً؛ لأن العقد على الأولى صحيح، والعقد على الثانية غير صحيح، فتترك الأخيرة.
والمقصود من هذه الترجمة بيان ما يحرم أن يجمع بينه من النساء، والجمع المحرم إنما هو بين النساء القريبات المحرم الجمع بينهن، كأن تكونا أختين، كما جاء في القرآن: {وَأَنْ تَجْمَعُوا بَيْنَ الأُخْتَيْنِ إِلَّا مَا قَدْ سَلَفَ} [النساء: ٢٣] سواءٌ أكان في الزواج أم في ملك اليمين، فلا يُجمع بين الأختين في الزواج فإذا تزوج إحدى الأختين فلا تحل له أختها إلا إذا طلقها وانتهت من العدة، حتى في حال عدتها لا يجوز له أن يتزوجها؛ لأن المطلقة الرجعية زوجة، فلو تزوج أختها في حال عدتها فإنه يكون بذلك قد جمع بين الأختين، وإنما يتزوج بالثانية عندما تخرج الأولى من العدة، ومعلوم أن العدة على النساء، والرجال يعتدون في حالتين يطلق عليهما عدة على سبيل الإلغاز، فالرجل يعتد إذا كانت عنده امرأة فيريد أن يتزوج أختها، فليس له أن يتزوج أختها حتى تفرغ من العدة، فهو نفسه يتربص هذه المدة فلا يتزوج بأختها.
والمسألة الثانية: إذا كان عنده أربع وأراد أن يتخلص من واحدة وينكح مكانها أخرى، فليس له أن يتزوج بدل الرابعة إلا إذا فرغت الرابعة من العدة؛ لأنه لو تزوج بدلها وهي في العدة فقد جمع بين خمس، فالرجعية زوجة، فهاتان الصورتان يلغزون بهما ويقولون: الرجل يعتد.
وكذلك في ملك اليمين لا يجمع بين أختين في الوطء، وأما أن يجمع بينهما في الملك فجائز، لكن الوطء ليس له أن يجمع فيه بينهما. len 238
Correcting segment parsing with regex
It seems the segment parsing went wrong because some segments have no blank lines after titles, causing issues when splitting. So, I’ll adjust the approach to parse more robustly based on occurrences, scanning each segment from the title start to the next "P" line. That way, no lines are missed in the translation.

import re
pattern=re.compile(r'(P\d+\s*-\s*.*?)(?=\nP\d+\s*-\s*|\Z)', re.S)

I'll open the file around those characters to confirm. The issue might be due to using the ellipsis character '…' (U+2026), which isn't the same as three dots. I'll search for that instead.

Searching for ellipsis character in text
text.find('…'), text.count('…')

Investigating ellipsis issue in file
It seems the ellipsis might be part of the file content itself, not just Python truncation. I initially missed it with my search, possibly because the file includes an ellipsis character (U+2026) instead of three periods. I'll check the codepoints and search for this character specifically to confirm.

Detecting period characters in text input
import unicodedata
# find any character that looks like period
period_positions=[i for i,ch in enumerate(text) if ch=='.']
len(period_positions), period_positions[:10]

(79, [164, 449, 816, 1040, 1213, 1434, 1645, 1811, 2097, 2323])
Checking for ellipses in file
It looks like there are period characters, so '...' may indeed exist. I'll focus on checking around position 160 in the file to confirm if there are any ellipses or other variations. This will help me pinpoint if the issue is from multiple periods or something else entirely.

Extracting text around position 160
print(text[140:190])

Searching for period and ellipsis sequence
I think I’ll try searching for the sequence ". . .", maybe there’s a special character separating the periods. A regex search for both periods and the actual ellipsis character should help me figure out what’s going on. This could reveal whether it’s a formatting issue or something else entirely.

Searching for ellipsis using regex
import re
m = re.search(r'\.{3}', text)

Understanding repr truncation behavior
It seems like the "..." I saw in the string wasn't an actual ellipsis character but a display formatting issue. Jupyter may be truncating the output for space, especially when the string is long. I’ll check the length of the string and count newlines, as this might help clarify why the output appears that way.

Confirming full content and display behavior
Jupyter is truncating the output in display, but the underlying string looks fine without actual '...'. To verify, I’ll print the string in full by splitting it into lines. This should show the complete content without truncation, and I can count and display each line for clarity.

Clarifying ellipses in content
It looks like Jupyter is showing truncation visually, but the actual content might contain a Unicode ellipsis (‘…’) instead of three dots. The string checks didn’t find it, even though it appears on display. I’ll need to double-check the substring where the ellipsis appears and inspect it closely.

Inspecting ellipsis in Arabic text string

Confirming display truncation and moving forward
It looks like the ellipsis didn’t actually appear in the data itself, but was inserted by the display to shorten the output. Since the text is in the full file, we can read from it directly without relying on display truncation. I'll extract and process the full Arabic data for translation as needed.

Extracting and breaking down text for translation
To ensure complete translation, we should access the full Arabic text from the file. Instead of relying on Jupyter's potential truncation, we can slice the text in smaller segments or write it to a temporary file for easier processing. I’ll check the length and break it into manageable pieces for efficient review.

Printing larger chunks properly for review
Jupyter keeps truncating the output, so to avoid this, I’ll print the text in smaller slices—each around 200 characters. That way, every printed slice will show up in full detail without being cut off. I’ll do this for P6752 to ensure we can review all the text clearly.

Handling output truncation in slices
The slice is still getting truncated, likely due to the environment’s character limit for display—each slice is showing ellipses ('...') inserted.

Ensuring complete Arabic text for translation
Since the tool's initial output includes the full Arabic text for P6752, we can base the translation on this. However, to ensure accuracy and no omissions, it's a good idea to open the file directly.

P6750 - هل يحرم ما دون خمس رضعات

P6751 - شرح حديث: (كان فيما أنزل الله عز وجل من القرآن عشر رضعات يحرمن)
قال المصنف رحمه الله تعالى: [باب هل يحرم ما دون خمس رضعات.
حدثنا عبد الله بن مسلمة القعنبي عن مالك عن عبد الله بن أبي بكر بن محمد بن عمرو بن حزم عن عمرة بنت عبد الرحمن عن عائشة رضي الله عنها أنها قالت: كان فيما أنزل الله عز وجل من القرآن عشر رضعات يحرمن، ثم نسخن بخمس معلومات يحرمن، فتوفي النبي صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم وهن مما يقرأ من القرآن].
قال المصنف رحمه الله تعالى: [باب هل يحرم ما دون خمس رضعات، وقد اختلف العلماء في الرضاع المحرم على ثلاثة أقوال: القول الأول: هو ما بلغ خمس رضعات فأكثر، والدليل على ذلك هذا الحديث الذي أورده أبو داود عن عائشة رضي الله تعالى عنها قالت: (كان فيما أنزل الله عز وجل من القرآن عشر رضعات يحرمن فنسخن بخمس معلومات يحرمن فتوفي النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم وهن مما يقرأ من القرآن].
واحتجوا أيضاً بالحديث الذي سبق أن مر في رضاع الكبير حيث قال فيه: (أرضعيه خمس رضعات)، وهو حديث صحيح، ولكنه -كما عرف- خاص بـ سالم مولى أبي حذيفة، وقد جاء فيه ذكر الخمس، فهو دليل على أن المعتبر في الرضاع هو ما بلغ الخمس رضعات.
القول الثاني: أن المحرم هي ثلاث رضعات فأكثر، ويستدل على ذلك بالحديث الذي سيأتي، وهو قوله: (لا تحرم المصة ولا المصتان)، قالوا: فمفهومه يدل على أنه إذا زاد على ذلك فإنه يحرم.
القول الثالث: أن الرضاع قليله وكثيره يحرم؛ لأنه جاء مطلقاً في بعض النصوص، كقوله تعالى: {وَأُمَّهَاتُكُمُ اللَّاتِي أَرْضَعْنَكُمْ وَأَخَوَاتُكُمْ مِنَ الرَّضَاعَةِ} [النساء: ٢٣]، فجاء مطلقاً، قالوا: فيحرم القليل والكثير.
والقول الصحيح والراجح من هذه الأقوال هو القول بأن المحرم هي خمس رضعات؛ لأنه قد جاء ما يدل عليه من سنة رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم كما في هذا الحديث الذي أورده أبو داود، والحديث الذي سبق أن تقدم في رضاع الكبير.
وأورد أبو داود هنا حديث عائشة [كان فيما أنزل الله عز وجل من القرآن عشر رضعات يحرمن، فنسخن بخمس معلومات يحرمن، فتوفي النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم وهن مما يقرأ من القرآن].
قوله: (وهن) أي: الخمس؛ لأن الإشارة إلى الخمس، وليس في القرآن خمس رضعات يحرمن، لكن هذا فيه إشارة إلى قرب التحريم من وفاة الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم، وأن بعض الناس الذين لم يبلغهم النسخ استمروا على القراءة حتى بلغهم النسخ، وذلك لقربه من وفاة الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم، فالنسخ جاء متأخراً.

P6752 - أنواع النسخ في القرآن الكريم
هذا الحديث دليل على أن التحريم إنما يكون بخمس رضعات، وهو أيضاً دليل لنوعين من أنواع النسخ في القرآن الكريم؛ لأن النسخ بالنسبة للتلاوة والحكم ثلاثة أقسام: الأول: نسخ التلاوة والحكم جميعاً.
الثاني: نسخ الحكم مع بقاء التلاوة.
الثالث: نسخ التلاوة مع بقاء الحكم.
وهذا الحديث فيه مثال لقسمين هما: نسخ التلاوة والحكم في مسألة عشر رضعات معلومات يحرمن؛ لأنه نسخ الحكم والتلاوة، فالحكم منسوخ والتلاوة منسوخة.
وخمس رضعات يحرمن نسخت فيها التلاوة وبقي الحكم.

P6756 - الرضخ عند الفصال

P6757 - شرح حديث بيان إذهاب مذمة الرضاعة بالغرة
قال المصنف رحمه الله تعالى: [باب في الرضخ عند الفصال.
حدثنا عبد الله بن محمد النفيلي حدثنا أبو معاوية.
ح: وحدثنا ابن العلاء حدثنا ابن إدريس عن هشام بن عروة عن أبيه عن حجاج بن حجاج عن أبيه رضي الله عنه أنه قال: قلت: يا رسول الله! ما يذهب عني مذمة الرضاعة؟ قال: (الغرة العبد أو الأمة).
قال النفيلي: حجاج بن حجاج الأسلمي.
وهذا لفظه].
أورد أبو داود هذه الترجمة، وهي [باب الرضخ عند الفصال]، والرضخ هو ما تعطاه المرضعة عند تمام الإرضاع، حيث تنتهي مهمتها وتنتهي علاقتها بمن أرضعت لهم، فيعطونها أجرتها ويرضخون لها شيئاً غير متفق عليه، فمن تمام الإحسان وتمام المعاملة أنهم يكرمونها ويتحفونها بشيء غير الأجرة التي اتفقوا معها عليها، فهذا هو المقصود بالرضخ، أي أنها تعطى شيئاً غير الذي اتفق عليه على أنه أجرة لها.
وقد جاء في هذا حديث حجاج بن حجاج الأسلمي عن أبيه أنه قال: [يا رسول الله! ما يذهب عني مذمة الرضاعة؟]، ومذمة الرضاع حقه وذمامه، والمقصود به الحق والمعروف الذي حصل من المرضعة، فما الذي يذهبه عني إذا فعلته؟ وهو إحسان في مقابل إحسان؟ قال: (غرة) يعني: عبداً؛ لأنه كما أنها قامت بالإحسان إلى الطفل في حال صغره وقامت بإرضاعه فإنها تعطى شيئاً يذهب ذلك الحق، ويكون الإنسان قد أدى الحق الذي عليه.
فإذا كان المقصود به الطفل الذي أرضع فهذا لا يكون عند الفصال، بل لا يكون إلا متأخراً، أعني إذا أراد الرضيع أن يحسن فهو لن يحسن إلا بعد زمن متأخر، فالرضخ عند الفصال يقصد به أنه من المستأجر الذي هو والد الطفل أو أم الطفل أو عم الطفل أو قريب الطفل، وهنا كأنه يشعر بأن المقصود بذلك أن الذي أرضع يريد أن يحسن إلى أمه من الرضاعة، ويؤدي لها الحق الذي عليه، وذلك بأن يعطيها عبداً أو أمة تخدمها؛ لأنها قامت بالإحسان إليه في حال صغره، وقد بلغت من الكبر ما بلغت، فكونه يعطيها من يخدمها ويقوم بالإحسان إليها مكافأة لها على ذلك هو المقصود من الحديث.
وهذا الحديث ضعيف؛ لأن في إسناده حجاج بن الحجاج، وهو مقبول لا يحتج بحديثه إلا إذا توبع، وليس له هنا متابع، فالحديث غير ثابت عن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم.

P6760 - ما يكره أن يجمع بينهن من النساء

P6761 - شرح حديث: (لا تنكح المرأة على عمتها)
قال المصنف رحمه الله تعالى: [باب ما يكره أن يجمع بينهن من النساء.
حدثنا عبد الله بن محمد النفيلي حدثنا زهير حدثنا داود بن أبي هند عن عامر عن أبي هريرة رضي الله عنه أنه قال: قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم: (لا تنكح المرأة على عمتها، ولا العمة على بنت أخيها، ولا المرأة على خالتها، ولا الخالة على بنت أختها، ولا تنكح الكبرى على الصغرى، ولا الصغرى على الكبرى)].
أورد أبو داود ما يكره من أن يجمع بينه من النساء، يعني: ما يحرم؛ لأن الكراهة عند المتقدمين بمعنى التحريم، كما قال تعالى: {كُلُّ ذَلِكَ كَانَ سَيِّئُهُ عِنْدَ رَبِّكَ مَكْرُوهًا} [الإسراء: ٣٨] بعد ذكر عدد من المحرمات.
فقوله تعالى (مَكْرُوهًا) أي: محرماً.
وأما في اصطلاح الفقهاء فإنهم يجعلون المكروه هو الذي جاء النهي عنه على وجه لا جزم فيه، وهو ما يثاب تاركه ولا يعاقب فاعله، وطلب الشارع تركه طلباً غير جازم، والمحرم هو ما يثاب تاركه ويعاقب فاعله، وطلب الشارع تركه طلباً جازماً، فالكراهة هنا بمعنى التحريم؛ لأن الجمع بين المرأة وعمتها وخالتها محرم وليس مكروهاً تنزيهاً بمعنى أنه يجوز أن يفعل مع الكراهة، وإنما هو ممنوع فلا يجوز الجمع، ولو حصل وجب التفريق، ولو أنه وجد ثم تبين أن هذه عمة أو خالة أو حصل جهل بذلك فإنه يجب التفريق بينهما، فتترك الأخيرة التي جاءت أخيراً؛ لأن العقد على الأولى صحيح، والعقد على الثانية غير صحيح، فتترك الأخيرة.
والمقصود من هذه الترجمة بيان ما يحرم أن يجمع بينه من النساء، والجمع المحرم إنما هو بين النساء القريبات المحرم الجمع بينهن، كأن تكونا أختين، كما جاء في القرآن: {وَأَنْ تَجْمَعُوا بَيْنَ الأُخْتَيْنِ إِلَّا مَا قَدْ سَلَفَ} [النساء: ٢٣] سواءٌ أكان في الزواج أم في ملك اليمين، فلا يُجمع بين الأختين في الزواج فإذا تزوج إحدى الأختين فلا تحل له أختها إلا إذا طلقها وانتهت من العدة، حتى في حال عدتها لا يجوز له أن يتزوجها؛ لأن المطلقة الرجعية زوجة، فلو تزوج أختها في حال عدتها فإنه يكون بذلك قد جمع بين الأختين، وإنما يتزوج بالثانية عندما تخرج الأولى من العدة، ومعلوم أن العدة على النساء، والرجال يعتدون في حالتين يطلق عليهما عدة على سبيل الإلغاز، فالرجل يعتد إذا كانت عنده امرأة فيريد أن يتزوج أختها، فليس له أن يتزوج أختها حتى تفرغ من العدة، فهو نفسه يتربص هذه المدة فلا يتزوج بأختها.
والمسألة الثانية: إذا كان عنده أربع وأراد أن يتخلص من واحدة وينكح مكانها أخرى، فليس له أن يتزوج بدل الرابعة إلا إذا فرغت الرابعة من العدة؛ لأنه لو تزوج بدلها وهي في العدة فقد جمع بين خمس، فالرجعية زوجة، فهاتان الصورتان يلغزون بهما ويقولون: الرجل يعتد.
وكذلك في ملك اليمين لا يجمع بين أختين في الوطء، وأما أن يجمع بينهما في الملك فجائز، لكن الوطء ليس له أن يجمع فيه بينهما.
وقوله تعالى بعدما ذكر المحرمات من النسب ومن الرضاعة ومن المصاهرة: {وَأُحِلَّ لَكُمْ مَا وَرَاءَ ذَلِكُمْ} [النساء: ٢٤] يشمل إباحة الجمع بين المرأة وعمتها والمرأة وخالتها، فجاءت السنة واستثنت من ذلك الجمع بين المرأة وعمتها والمرأة وخالتها.
Translating the Arabic content fully
We can now see the entire Arabic text through the terminal, so it’s time to fully translate each chunk, starting with P6752. It’s important not to omit any part, including bracketed citations or specific phrases like "kingly." We'll also maintain the Arabic curly braces and number the surahs and verses as needed.

Translating hadith and terminology with precision
The hadith refers to not marrying the elder over the younger or vice versa. This could mean marrying two sisters or a woman and her stepdaughter. We'll keep the literal translation and use technical terms like "ownership of the right hand" for “ملك اليمين”. Also, terms like "revocably divorced woman" for "المطلقة الرجعية" need accurate translations. Let’s verify transliterations for consistency.

Finalizing translation and ensuring accuracy
I need to use ʻ and ʼ for names, making sure to employ dotted letters like ḥ and ṣ for accurate transliteration in ALA-LC. I'll apply the same for names like Muḥammad and Ḥazm. The final translation must start with the proper identifiers per segment and maintain bracketed [باب ...] for translation. After three revisions—first for structure, then accuracy, and lastly transliteration—I’ll run a final check for the Arabic script's correctness.

P6751 - Explanation of the hadith: “Among what Allah, Mighty and Majestic, sent down of the Qur’an were ten sucklings that make unlawful”
The compiler (may Allah Most High have mercy on him) said: [Chapter: Does what is less than five sucklings make unlawful.
ʻAbd Allāh ibn Maslamah al-Qaʻnabī narrated to us, from Mālik, from ʻAbd Allāh ibn Abī Bakr ibn Muḥammad ibn ʻAmr ibn Ḥazm, from ʻAmrah bint ʻAbd al-Raḥmān, from ʻĀʼishah (may Allah be pleased with her), that she said: Among what Allah, Mighty and Majestic, sent down of the Qur’an were ten sucklings that make unlawful. Then they were abrogated by five known sucklings that make unlawful. Then the Prophet ﷺ passed away while they were among what was recited of the Qur’an.]

The compiler (may Allah Most High have mercy on him) said: [Chapter: Does what is less than five sucklings make unlawful. The scholars differed regarding the suckling that causes prohibition in three views:
The first view: it is what reaches five sucklings or more, and the evidence for that is this hadith which Abu Dawud cited from ʻĀʼishah (may Allah Most High be pleased with her), who said: “Among what Allah, Mighty and Majestic, sent down of the Qur’an were ten sucklings that make unlawful, so they were abrogated by five known sucklings that make unlawful. Then the Prophet ﷺ passed away while they were among what was recited of the Qur’an.”
They also argued with the hadith that previously passed concerning the suckling of an adult, in which he said: “Breastfeed him five sucklings.” It is an authentic hadith, but—as is known—it is specific to Salim, the freedman of Abu Hudhayfah. In it, the five are mentioned, so it is evidence that what is considered in suckling is what reaches five sucklings.
The second view: that what makes unlawful is three sucklings or more. They infer that from the hadith that will come, namely his statement: “A single suckle does not make unlawful, nor do two suckles.” They said: its implied meaning indicates that if it is more than that, then it makes unlawful.
The third view: that little and much suckling both make unlawful, because it has come unrestricted in some texts, such as Allah Most High’s statement: “And your mothers who breastfed you, and your sisters through suckling” (al-Nisa’ 4:23). It came unrestricted. They said: thus the little and the much make unlawful.
The correct and preponderant view among these views is the view that what makes unlawful is five sucklings, because what indicates it has come from the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, as in this hadith which Abu Dawud cited, and the hadith that has already preceded regarding the suckling of an adult.
Abu Dawud cited here the hadith of ʻĀʼishah: “Among what Allah, Mighty and Majestic, sent down of the Qur’an were ten sucklings that make unlawful; so they were abrogated by five known sucklings that make unlawful. Then the Prophet ﷺ passed away while they were among what was recited of the Qur’an.”
His statement: “while they” means: the five, because the pointing is to the five. There is not in the Qur’an “five sucklings make unlawful,” but in this there is an indication of the closeness of the abrogation to the death of the Messenger ﷺ, and that some people who had not received news of the abrogation continued the recitation until the abrogation reached them, due to its being close to the death of the Messenger ﷺ. So the abrogation came late.]

P6752 - Types of abrogation in the Noble Qur’an
This hadith is evidence that prohibition is only by five sucklings, and it is also evidence for two kinds among the kinds of abrogation in the Noble Qur’an, because abrogation with respect to recitation and ruling is of three divisions:
First: abrogation of both the recitation and the ruling together.
Second: abrogation of the ruling while the recitation remains.
Third: abrogation of the recitation while the ruling remains.
This hadith contains an example of two divisions: abrogation of recitation and ruling in the issue of “ten known sucklings make unlawful,” because the ruling and the recitation were abrogated: the ruling is abrogated and the recitation is abrogated.
And “five sucklings make unlawful” was such that its recitation was abrogated while the ruling remained.
An example of the third division—abrogation of the ruling while the recitation remains—is the verse about the waiting period of the woman whose husband dies being a full year, namely Allah Most High’s statement: “And those of you who die and leave wives: a bequest for their wives, provision for a year, without expulsion” (al-Baqarah 2:240). Its ruling is abrogated while its recitation remains, and what abrogated it is the verse before it, namely that they wait four months and ten days. Thus the divisions of abrogation, with respect to recitation and ruling, are three: abrogation of recitation and ruling, abrogation of recitation while the ruling remains, and abrogation of the ruling while the recitation remains. The hadith that is with us is evidence for the first two.
And the third division is: abrogation of the ruling while the recitation remains, as a verse.

P6756 - The gratuity at weaning

P6757 - Explanation of the hadith clarifying removal of the obligation of suckling by a ghurrah
The compiler (may Allah Most High have mercy on him) said: [Chapter: On the gratuity at weaning.
ʻAbd Allāh ibn Muḥammad al-Nufaylī narrated to us; Abū Muʻāwiyah narrated to us.
Ḥ: And Ibn al-ʻAlāʼ narrated to us; Ibn Idrīs narrated to us, from Hishām ibn ʻUrwah, from his father, from Ḥajjāj ibn Ḥajjāj, from his father (may Allah be pleased with him), that he said: I said: O Messenger of Allah! What will remove from me the obligation of suckling? He said: “A ghurrah: a male slave or a female slave.”
Al-Nufaylī said: Ḥajjāj ibn Ḥajjāj al-Aslamī.
This is its wording.]

Abu Dawud brought this chapter heading, namely: Chapter: the gratuity at weaning. The gratuity is what is given to the wet nurse when she completes the nursing, when her task ends and her connection with those for whom she breastfed ends. They give her her wage and give her a gratuity that was not agreed upon. Part of perfect kindness and proper dealings is that they honor her and present her with something beyond the wage that they agreed upon with her. This is what is meant by the gratuity, meaning that she is given something other than what was agreed upon as her wage.
In this there has come the hadith of Hajjaj ibn Hajjaj al-Aslami, from his father, that he said: “O Messenger of Allah! What will remove from me the obligation of suckling?” The “obligation” of suckling is its right and its bond of obligation; what is meant is the right and the known favor that came from the wet nurse. So what will remove it from me if I do it? Is it kindness in return for kindness? He said: “A ghurrah,” meaning: a slave, because just as she showed kindness to the child while he was small and nursed him, she is given something that removes that right, and a person has fulfilled the right that is upon him.
If what is meant by it is the child who was nursed, then that would not be at weaning; rather, it would only be later, meaning that if the nursling wants to show kindness, he will not show kindness except after a later time. So the gratuity at weaning is intended to be from the one who hired her, who is the child’s father, or the child’s mother, or the child’s paternal uncle, or a relative of the child. Here it is as though it suggests that what is intended by that is that the one who was nursed wants to show kindness to his suckling-mother and fulfill her right that is upon him, by giving her a male slave or a female slave to serve her, because she showed kindness to him while he was small, and she has reached what she has reached of old age. So his giving her someone to serve her and show kindness to her, as a recompense to her for that, is what is intended by the hadith.
This hadith is weak, because in its chain is Hajjaj ibn al-Hajjaj, and he is acceptable: his hadith is not used as proof unless he is corroborated, and he has no corroborator here. So the hadith is not established from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ.

Al-Nufaylī is his first shaykh, meaning that he ascribed him, saying: al-Aslami. Then Abu Dawud said: [This is its wording], meaning: this hadith’s wording is the wording of the first shaykh, namely al-Nufaylī.
So it may be that what is meant is the entire hadith, or that what is meant is that this addition is his wording.

P6759 - Explanation of Sunan Abu Dawud [238]
The Sacred Law has prevented combining a woman with her paternal aunt or her maternal aunt, because of what that contains of resentment and hatred that lead to severing ties and turning away between relatives. This is from the wisdom of the Sacred Law in blocking the avenues of corruption and evil.
It has come that Ali wanted to marry the daughter of Abu Jahl, so the Prophet ﷺ stood as a preacher and clarified that Fatimah is a part of him, and that he fears for her, from that, that she might be tried in her religion. In this too there is blocking the avenues of tribulations and corruption from the servants, let alone relatives.

P6760 - What is disliked to combine between them, from women

P6761 - Explanation of the hadith: “A woman is not married alongside her paternal aunt”
The compiler (may Allah Most High have mercy on him) said: [Chapter: What is disliked to combine between them, from women.
ʻAbd Allāh ibn Muḥammad al-Nufaylī narrated to us; Zuhayr narrated to us; Dāwūd ibn Abī Hind narrated to us, from ʻĀmir, from Abū Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), that he said: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: “A woman is not married alongside her paternal aunt, nor is a paternal aunt alongside her brother’s daughter; nor is a woman alongside her maternal aunt, nor is a maternal aunt alongside her sister’s daughter; and the elder is not married alongside the younger, nor the younger alongside the elder.”]

Abu Dawud brought what is disliked to be combined between from women, meaning: what is unlawful, because “disliked” among the earlier scholars is in the meaning of “unlawful,” as Allah Most High said: “All of that—its evil, with your Lord, is disliked” (al-Isra’ 17:38), after mentioning a number of prohibitions.
So His statement “disliked” means: unlawful.
As for the jurists’ terminology, they make the disliked to be that which a prohibition has come about, but in a manner that is not decisive. It is what the one who leaves it is rewarded for and the one who does it is not punished for, and the Lawgiver sought its abandonment in a non-decisive manner. The unlawful is what the one who leaves it is rewarded for and the one who does it is punished for, and the Lawgiver sought its abandonment decisively. So “disliked” here is in the meaning of unlawful, because combining a woman with her paternal aunt or her maternal aunt is unlawful, not disliked as a mere discouragement in the sense that one may do it along with dislike. Rather, it is forbidden, so combining is not permissible. If it occurs, separation becomes obligatory. And if it occurred and then it became clear that this is a paternal aunt or a maternal aunt, or ignorance occurred regarding that, then separation between them is obligatory. So the latter one, who came last, is left, because the contract upon the first is valid and the contract upon the second is not valid, so the latter is left.
What is intended by this chapter heading is to clarify what is unlawful to combine between from women, and unlawful combining is only between related women between whom combining is prohibited, such as two sisters, as has come in the Qur’an: “And that you combine between two sisters, except what has already passed” (al-Nisa’ 4:23), whether in marriage or in ownership of the right hand. Thus two sisters are not combined in marriage: if he marries one of the sisters, then her sister is not lawful for him unless he divorces her and she has finished her waiting period. Even during her waiting period it is not permissible for him to marry her sister, because the revocably divorced woman is a wife. So if he married her sister during her waiting period, he would thereby have combined between two sisters. He only marries the second when the first leaves her waiting period. It is known that the waiting period is upon women. Men “observe a waiting period” in two cases that they call a waiting period by way of posing a riddle: the man “observes a waiting period” when he has a wife and wants to marry her sister; he may not marry her sister until she finishes the waiting period, so he himself waits this period and does not marry her sister.
The second case: when he has four wives and wants to be rid of one and marry another in her place; he may not marry in place of the fourth until the fourth finishes her waiting period, because if he married in her place while she is in her waiting period, he would have combined between five, since the revocably divorced woman is a wife. So these two situations are posed as riddles, and they say: the man observes a waiting period.
Likewise, in ownership of the right hand, two sisters are not combined in intercourse. As for combining between them in ownership, it is permissible, but in intercourse it is not permissible for him to combine between them.
And Allah Most High’s statement, after mentioning the prohibited women by lineage, by suckling, and by marriage ties: “And it has been permitted to you what is beyond that” (al-Nisa’ 4:24) includes the permissibility of combining a woman with her paternal aunt and a woman with her maternal aunt, so the Sunnah came and made an exception from that: combining a woman with her paternal aunt and a woman with her maternal aunt.

Finalizing complete translation
I noticed that some parts had ellipses because of previous truncations, and I need to remove those while adding the missing details for full accuracy. For example, in P6752, the sentence after "Thus the divisions..." should be included in full. I must ensure no parts are left out, particularly regarding the divisions of abrogation, as the section should read: "فعلى هذا تكون أقسام النسخ بالنسبة للتلاوة والحكم ثلاثة..."

Finalizing incomplete translation sections
There are some areas where translations were truncated, mainly due to ellipses. These sections need to be completed:

In P6754, I need to finish: "but they are less than the five which came in the hadith as making unlawful."

In P6757, several paragraphs need completion too.

For P6761, the hadith about the elder and younger marriage needs its full translation.

I'll make sure the translation is accurate while maintaining a literal approach. Additionally, I'll ensure proper technical terms, such as "Ḥ" for the hadith chain and "The compilers of the six books..." as the final translation in P6758.

Refining translation for P6757 and finalizing draft
In P6757, I need to clarify the meaning of "مذمة الرضاعة" as it seems to be more about "blame" rather than just "obligation," translating it as "the stigma of suckling" or "the liability of suckling." I’ll stick with "obligation of suckling" to stay in line with the intended interpretation. The term "الغرة العبد أو الأمة" is clearly referring to a "ghurrah," meaning male or female slave.

I'll make sure to rewrite everything carefully, ensuring the translation is accurate and without truncation (like ellipses). I’ll also avoid using Arabic numerals or letters, as per the guidelines. Time to finalize!

P6751 - Explanation of the hadith: “Among what Allah, Mighty and Majestic, sent down of the Qur’an were ten sucklings that make unlawful”
The compiler (may Allah Most High have mercy on him) said: [Chapter: Does what is less than five sucklings make unlawful.
ʻAbd Allāh ibn Maslamah al-Qaʻnabī narrated to us, from Mālik, from ʻAbd Allāh ibn Abī Bakr ibn Muḥammad ibn ʻAmr ibn Ḥazm, from ʻAmrah bint ʻAbd al-Raḥmān, from ʻĀʼishah (may Allah be pleased with her), that she said: Among what Allah, Mighty and Majestic, sent down of the Qur’an were ten sucklings that make unlawful; then they were abrogated by five known sucklings that make unlawful; then the Prophet ﷺ passed away while they were among what was recited of the Qur’an.]

The compiler (may Allah Most High have mercy on him) said: [Chapter: Does what is less than five sucklings make unlawful. The scholars differed regarding the suckling that causes prohibition in three views:
The first view: it is what reaches five sucklings or more, and the evidence for that is this hadith which Abu Dawud cited from ʻĀʼishah (may Allah Most High be pleased with her), who said: “Among what Allah, Mighty and Majestic, sent down of the Qur’an were ten sucklings that make unlawful, so they were abrogated by five known sucklings that make unlawful; then the Prophet ﷺ passed away while they were among what was recited of the Qur’an.”

First: abrogation of both the recitation and the ruling together.

This hadith contains an example of two divisions: abrogation of the recitation and the ruling in the issue of ten known sucklings that make unlawful, because the ruling and the recitation were abrogated: the ruling is abrogated and the recitation is abrogated.
And “five sucklings make unlawful” was such that its recitation was abrogated while the ruling remained.
An example of the third division—abrogation of the ruling while the recitation remains—is the verse about the waiting period of the woman whose husband dies being a full year, namely Allah Most High’s statement: “And those of you who die and leave wives: a bequest for their wives, provision for a year, without expulsion” (al-Baqarah 2:240). Its ruling is abrogated while its recitation remains, and what abrogated it is the verse before it, namely that they wait four months and ten days. Thus the divisions of abrogation with respect to recitation and ruling are three: abrogation of recitation and ruling, abrogation of recitation while the ruling remains, and abrogation of ruling while the recitation remains; and the hadith that is with us is a witness to the first two.
And the third division is: abrogation of the ruling while the recitation remains, as a verse.

P6756 - The gratuity at weaning

P6757 - Explanation of the hadith clarifying removal of the obligation of suckling by a ghurrah
The compiler (may Allah Most High have mercy on him) said: [Chapter: On the gratuity at weaning.
ʻAbd Allāh ibn Muḥammad al-Nufaylī narrated to us; Abū Muʻāwiyah narrated to us.
Ḥ: And Ibn al-ʻAlāʼ narrated to us; Ibn Idrīs narrated to us, from Hishām ibn ʻUrwah, from his father, from Ḥajjāj ibn Ḥajjāj, from his father (may Allah be pleased with him), that he said: I said: O Messenger of Allah! What will remove from me the obligation of suckling? He said: “A ghurrah: a male slave or a female slave.”
Al-Nufaylī said: Ḥajjāj ibn Ḥajjāj al-Aslamī.
This is its wording.]

Abu Dawud brought this chapter heading, namely: Chapter: on the gratuity at weaning. The gratuity is what is given to the wet nurse upon completion of the nursing, when her task ends and her connection with those for whom she breastfed ends. They give her her wage, and they give her a gratuity that was not agreed upon. Part of perfect beneficence and perfect dealings is that they honor her and gift her something besides the wage that they agreed upon with her. This is what is meant by the gratuity, meaning that she is given something other than what was agreed upon as her wage.
In this there has come the hadith of Hajjaj ibn Hajjaj al-Aslami, from his father, that he said: “O Messenger of Allah! What will remove from me the obligation of suckling?” The obligation of suckling is its right and its bond of obligation; what is meant by it is the right and the known favor that came from the wet nurse. So what will remove it from me if I do it? Is it beneficence in return for beneficence? He said: “A ghurrah,” meaning: a slave, because just as she showed beneficence to the child while he was small and breastfed him, she is given something that removes that right, and the person has fulfilled the right that was due upon him.
If what is meant by it is the child who was breastfed, then that would not be at weaning; rather, it would only be later, meaning that if the nursling wants to show beneficence, he will not show beneficence except after a later time. So the gratuity at weaning is intended to be from the one who hired her, who is the child’s father, or the child’s mother, or the child’s paternal uncle, or a relative of the child. Here it is as though it suggests that what is intended by that is that the one who was breastfed wants to show beneficence to his foster-mother, and to fulfill the right due upon him to her, by giving her a male slave or a female slave to serve her, because she showed beneficence to him while he was small, and she has reached whatever age she has reached. So his giving her someone to serve her and to show beneficence to her, as recompense to her for that, is what is intended by the hadith.
This hadith is weak, because in its chain is Hajjaj ibn al-Hajjaj, and he is acceptable: his hadith is not used as proof unless he is corroborated, and he has no corroborator here. So the hadith is not established from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ.

So it may be that what is meant is the entire hadith, or that what is meant is that this addition is his wording.

P6759 - Explanation of Sunan Abu Dawud [238]
The Sacred Law has prevented combining a woman with her paternal aunt or her maternal aunt, because of what that contains of resentment and hatred that lead to severing ties and turning away between relatives. This is from the wisdom of the Sacred Law in blocking the avenues of corruption and evil.
It has come that Ali wanted to marry the daughter of Abu Jahl, so the Prophet ﷺ stood as a preacher and clarified that Fatimah is a part of him, and that he fears for her, from that, that she might be tried in her religion. In this too there is blocking the avenues of tribulations and corruption from the servants, let alone relatives.

P6760 - What is disliked to combine between them, from women

P6761 - Explanation of the hadith: “A woman is not married alongside her paternal aunt”
The compiler (may Allah Most High have mercy on him) said: [Chapter: What is disliked to combine between them, from women.
ʻAbd Allāh ibn Muḥammad al-Nufaylī narrated to us; Zuhayr narrated to us; Dāwūd ibn Abī Hind narrated to us, from ʻĀmir, from Abū Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), that he said: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: “A woman is not married alongside her paternal aunt, nor is a paternal aunt alongside her brother’s daughter; nor is a woman alongside her maternal aunt, nor is a maternal aunt alongside her sister’s daughter; and the elder is not married alongside the younger, nor the younger alongside the elder.”]

Abu Dawud brought what is disliked to be combined between from women, meaning: what is unlawful, because “disliked” among the earlier scholars is in the meaning of “unlawful,” as Allah Most High said: “All of that—its evil, with your Lord, is disliked” (al-Isra’ 17:38), after mentioning a number of prohibitions.
So His statement “disliked” means: unlawful.
As for the jurists’ terminology, they make the disliked to be that about which a prohibition came in a manner that is not decisive. It is what the one who leaves it is rewarded for and the one who does it is not punished for; the Lawgiver sought its abandonment in a non-decisive manner. The unlawful is what the one who leaves it is rewarded for and the one who does it is punished for; the Lawgiver sought its abandonment decisively. So “disliked” here is in the meaning of unlawful, because combining a woman with her paternal aunt or her maternal aunt is unlawful and is not merely disliked in the sense of discouragement, meaning that it would be permitted to do it along with dislike. Rather, it is forbidden, so combining is not permitted. If it occurs, separation is obligatory. Even if it occurred and then it became clear that this is a paternal aunt or a maternal aunt, or ignorance of that occurred, then separation between them is obligatory, and the latter one who came last is left, because the contract upon the first is valid, and the contract upon the second is not valid, so the latter is left.
What is intended by this chapter heading is to clarify what is unlawful to combine between from women. Unlawful combining is only between related women between whom combining is prohibited, such as two sisters, as has come in the Qur’an: “And that you combine between two sisters, except what has already passed” (al-Nisa’ 4:23), whether in marriage or in ownership of the right hand. Thus two sisters are not combined in marriage: if he marries one of the sisters, then her sister is not lawful for him except if he divorces her and she has completed her waiting period. Even during her waiting period it is not permitted for him to marry her, because the revocably divorced woman is a wife; so if he married her sister during her waiting period, he would thereby have combined between the two sisters. Rather, he marries the second when the first exits the waiting period. It is known that the waiting period is upon women, and men “observe a waiting period” in two cases, which are called a waiting period by way of riddling: the man observes a waiting period if he has a woman and wants to marry her sister; he may not marry her sister until she finishes her waiting period. So he himself waits during this period and does not marry her sister.
The second case is when he has four wives and wants to be rid of one and marry another in her place; he may not marry in place of the fourth until the fourth finishes her waiting period, because if he married in her place while she is in her waiting period, he would have combined between five, since the revocably divorced woman is a wife. So these two situations are posed as riddles, and they say: the man observes a waiting period.
Likewise, in ownership of the right hand, two sisters are not combined in intercourse. As for combining between them in ownership, it is permissible, but in intercourse it is not permissible for him to combine between them.
And Allah Most High’s statement, after mentioning the prohibited women by lineage, by suckling, and by marriage ties: “And it has been permitted to you what is beyond that” (al-Nisa’ 4:24) includes the permissibility of combining a woman with her paternal aunt and a woman with her maternal aunt. So the Sunnah came and made an exception from that: combining a woman with her paternal aunt and combining a woman with her maternal aunt.

I’m trying to figure out why "meani..." shows up with three dots. It looks like I typed "meani..." intentionally, possibly as a truncation, but the check showed that it's not the same as the literal "..." ellipses.

Clearing up the "meani..." issue
I noticed that while most instances of "meani..." were removed, there are still some truncated paragraphs (like "meani..."). But in the line from P6757, "meani..." appeared properly as "meaning" without truncation, indicating the issue was resolved. I'll double check to ensure there are no remaining truncations.

Completing the translation for P6752
I realize I still need to complete the line in P6752 starting with "Thus the divisions..." where I originally wrote, but now I need to provide the full translation: "Thus the divisions of abrogation are three: abrogation of recitation and ruling, abrogation of recitation with ruling remaining, and the hadith we have is evidence for the two."

Fixing translation for P6752
There’s a repetition in the Arabic version with "والقسم الثالث: نسخ الحكم مع بقاء التلاوة آية," which I need to address when translating.

The full translation should be: "Thus, the divisions of abrogation in relation to recitation and ruling are three: abrogation of both recitation and ruling, abrogation of recitation with ruling remaining, and the hadith we have serves as evidence for both. The third division is the abrogation of ruling while the recitation remains an ayah."

Everything should be included as written.

Fixing truncated sentences and completing translations
It seems I've accidentally left some fragments in my writing like "thus the divisions..." and "but th...". I'll need to go back and make sure these sentences are fully translated. Similarly, there's some truncation in P6757 and P6761. I should rewrite those paragraphs, making sure all sentences are completed accurately, no shortcuts!

Fixing truncation and ensuring complete translation
I noticed I've left some sentences incomplete, like "but th..." and "meani..." from P6757, and portions of P6761, including "because combining a wom..." and "would be permitted to do ...". I need to return to these and ensure everything is fully translated and fixed. I'll rewrite P6752’s final paragraph without truncation.

Finalizing translations and completing explanations
I need to translate the third division, “abrogation of ruling while recitation remains, as a verse.” For P6754, the final sentence needs to be adjusted: “but rather they are less than the five...” In P6757, I'll fully translate the definitions of "الرَّضخ" and the explanations. Similarly, P6761 requires full translation for the hadith chain and commentary that follows. I'll ensure everything is included, clear, and accurate.

Finalizing translation and checking details
I need to make sure the translation of "revocable divorce" is clear. For "كراهة ... كما قال تعالى", I’ll translate it as “just as Allah Most High said: ‘All that—its evil is, with your Lord, detested.’" Also, I need to confirm the translation for verse 4:23 and get accurate transliterations for names like ‘Dāwūd ibn Abī Hind’ and others. Let's finalize everything properly.

Deciding on diacritics for narrator names
I’m trying to decide whether or not to add diacritics. The key rule is applying ALA-LC transliteration to narrators' names inside the chain. Since Hajjaj ibn Hajjaj is a narrator associated with the chain, I’ll transliterate it. Even though the mention is outside the core chain, it feels consistent with the guideline.

Deciding on transliteration for biographical sections
I’ve decided to transliterate narrator names from both the chains and the biographical sections, as these names are still tied to the narrators. This aligns with the instruction about transliterating only those linked to the chain. However, names like Ali or Fatimah aren’t part of the chain here, so I'll leave them untranslated for consistency.

Finalizing transliteration and translation choices
I’ve decided to restrict transliteration to narrator names only and translate other terms. For example, "Ahl al-Sunnah" will be translated as "the people of the Sunnah" or "Sunnis." "Dar al-Hijrah" can be translated as "the Abode of Emigration." I'll check the text again to avoid truncation and final consistency.

In the P6758 biography, I’ll transliterate narrator names with diacritics, like ʻAbd Allāh ibn Muḥammad ibn Nufayl al-Nufaylī and others in the chain. But non-narrators, like Salim, don’t need transliteration. For terms like "Ahl al-Sunnah," I'll translate rather than transliterate, sticking to the instruction to apply ALA-LC only to narrators’ names.

Fixing truncated phrases
I noticed truncations from incomplete words like "meaning t..." and "combini...". These aren't actual ellipses, but they've been inserted to shorten the text. I'll need to search for occurrences like "meaning t" and adjust them to complete the sentences properly, ensuring everything is whole and clear.

Completing truncated phrases and revising sentences
I found several incomplete words like "meaning t", "but th", and others. I need to fully rewrite these parts. For instance, in P6754, "but they are less than the five..." needs completion. In P6757, I’ll finish the truncated sentences, ensuring clarity, such as fully explaining the gratuity and rights given in Arabic terms.

Translating incomplete hadith and full paragraphs
For P6761, I'll complete the hadith chain with the Arabic translation: "and the elder is not married alongside the younger, nor the younger alongside the elder." This part doesn't need further adjustments.

Next, I need to translate the Arabic paragraphs fully. The first part discusses a hadith and includes an explanation from the Qur'an (Surah Al-Isra). I'll make sure to include the full translation with proper citation.

Translating legal terminology and hadith explanation
For the second part, I'll translate the explanation about “makruh” in fiqh: It refers to things that are discouraged but not strictly forbidden. This is clarified when the text mentions situations like marrying a woman and her aunt or niece, which is prohibited, not merely disliked.

Next, I'll explain the part about forbidden marriages, including the example of two sisters and divorce waiting.

Clarifying the translation and completeness
Alright, I need to ensure I translate the full passage about the 'iddah puzzle and revocable divorce. There's a paragraph missing about the last contract, and portions about the waiting period in relation to sisters haven't been fully transcribed. Don't forget the part mentioning the validity of the first contract and omission of the second one. I'll fix that.

P6751 - Explanation of the hadith: “Among what Allah, Mighty and Majestic, sent down of the Qur’an were ten sucklings that make unlawful”
The compiler (may Allah Most High have mercy on him) said: [Chapter: Does what is less than five sucklings make unlawful.
ʻAbd Allāh ibn Maslamah al-Qaʻnabī narrated to us, from Mālik, from ʻAbd Allāh ibn Abī Bakr ibn Muḥammad ibn ʻAmr ibn Ḥazm, from ʻAmrah bint ʻAbd al-Raḥmān, from ʻĀʼishah (may Allah be pleased with her), that she said: Among what Allah, Mighty and Majestic, sent down of the Qur’an were ten sucklings that make unlawful; then they were abrogated by five known sucklings that make unlawful; then the Prophet ﷺ passed away while they were among what was recited of the Qur’an.]

The compiler (may Allah Most High have mercy on him) said: [Chapter: Does what is less than five sucklings make unlawful. The scholars differed regarding the suckling that causes prohibition in three views:
The first view: it is what reaches five sucklings or more, and the evidence for that is this hadith which Abu Dawud cited from ʻĀʼishah (may Allah Most High be pleased with her), who said: “Among what Allah, Mighty and Majestic, sent down of the Qur’an were ten sucklings that make unlawful, so they were abrogated by five known sucklings that make unlawful; then the Prophet ﷺ passed away while they were among what was recited of the Qur’an.”
They also argued with the hadith that previously passed concerning the suckling of an adult, in which he said: “Breastfeed him five sucklings.” It is an authentic hadith, but—as is known—it is specific to Salim, the freedman of Abu Hudhayfah. In it, the five are mentioned, so it is evidence that what is considered in suckling is what reaches five sucklings.
The second view: that what makes unlawful is three sucklings or more. They infer that from the hadith that will come, namely his statement: “A single suckle does not make unlawful, nor do two suckles.” They said: its implied meaning indicates that if it is more than that, then it makes unlawful.
The third view: that little and much suckling both make unlawful, because it has come unrestricted in some texts, such as Allah Most High’s statement: “And your mothers who breastfed you, and your sisters through suckling” (al-Nisa’ 4:23). It came unrestricted. They said: thus the little and the much make unlawful.
The correct and preponderant view among these views is the view that what makes unlawful is five sucklings, because what indicates it has come from the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, as in this hadith which Abu Dawud cited, and the hadith that has already preceded concerning the suckling of an adult.
Abu Dawud cited here the hadith of ʻĀʼishah: “Among what Allah, Mighty and Majestic, sent down of the Qur’an were ten sucklings that make unlawful; so they were abrogated by five known sucklings that make unlawful; then the Prophet ﷺ passed away while they were among what was recited of the Qur’an.”
His statement: “while they” means: the five, because the pointing is to the five. There is not in the Qur’an “five sucklings make unlawful,” but in this there is an indication of the closeness of the abrogation to the death of the Messenger ﷺ, and that some people who had not received news of the abrogation continued the recitation until the abrogation reached them, due to its being close to the death of the Messenger ﷺ. So the abrogation came late.]

P6752 - Types of abrogation in the Noble Qur’an
This hadith is evidence that prohibition is only by five sucklings, and it is also evidence for two kinds among the kinds of abrogation in the Noble Qur’an, because abrogation with respect to recitation and ruling is of three divisions:
First: abrogation of both the recitation and the ruling together.
Second: abrogation of the ruling while the recitation remains.
Third: abrogation of the recitation while the ruling remains.
This hadith contains an example of two divisions: abrogation of the recitation and the ruling in the issue of “ten known sucklings make unlawful,” because the ruling and the recitation were abrogated: the ruling is abrogated and the recitation is abrogated.
And “five sucklings make unlawful” was such that its recitation was abrogated while the ruling remained.
An example of the third division—abrogation of the ruling while the recitation remains—is the verse about the waiting period of the woman whose husband dies being a full year, namely Allah Most High’s statement: “And those of you who die and leave wives: a bequest for their wives, provision for a year, without expulsion” (al-Baqarah 2:240). Its ruling is abrogated while its recitation remains, and what abrogated it is the verse before it, namely that they wait four months and ten days. Thus the divisions of abrogation with respect to recitation and ruling are three: abrogation of recitation and ruling, and abrogation of recitation while the ruling remains, and the hadith we have is a witness to the two. And the third division is: abrogation of the ruling while the recitation remains, as a verse.

This is explicitly stated here, but her statement, “so they were abrogated by five known sucklings that make unlawful,” indicates that what is less than it does not make unlawful, whether the one or the two explicitly stated in this hadith, or the third and the fourth that are not stated in the hadith, but they are less than the five which came in the hadith that it makes unlawful.

P6756 - The gratuity at weaning

P6757 - Explanation of the hadith clarifying removal of the obligation of suckling by a ghurrah
The compiler (may Allah Most High have mercy on him) said: [Chapter: On the gratuity at weaning.
ʻAbd Allāh ibn Muḥammad al-Nufaylī narrated to us; Abū Muʻāwiyah narrated to us.
Ḥ: And Ibn al-ʻAlāʼ narrated to us; Ibn Idrīs narrated to us, from Hishām ibn ʻUrwah, from his father, from Ḥajjāj ibn Ḥajjāj, from his father (may Allah be pleased with him), that he said: I said: O Messenger of Allah! What will remove from me the obligation of suckling? He said: “A ghurrah: a male slave or a female slave.”
Al-Nufaylī said: Ḥajjāj ibn Ḥajjāj al-Aslamī.
This is its wording.]

Abu Dawud brought this chapter heading, namely [Chapter: the gratuity at weaning]. The gratuity is what is given to the wet nurse upon completion of the nursing, when her task ends and her connection with those for whom she breastfed ends. They give her her wage and they give her a gratuity not agreed upon. Part of perfect beneficence and perfect dealings is that they honor her and present her with something besides the wage that they agreed with her upon. This is what is meant by the gratuity, meaning that she is given something other than what was agreed upon as her wage.
And in this there has come the hadith of Ḥajjāj ibn Ḥajjāj al-Aslamī from his father, that he said: “O Messenger of Allah! What will remove from me the obligation of suckling?” The obligation of suckling is its right and its bond of obligation; what is meant by it is the right and the known favor that came from the wet nurse. So what will remove it from me if I do it? Is it beneficence in return for beneficence? He said: “A ghurrah,” meaning: a slave, because just as she showed beneficence to the child while he was small and breastfed him, she is given something that removes that right, and the person has discharged the right he owes.
If what is meant by it is the child who was breastfed, then that would not be at weaning; rather, it would only be later, meaning that if the nursling wants to show beneficence, he will not show beneficence except after a later time. So the gratuity at weaning is intended to be from the one who hired her, who is the child’s father, or the child’s mother, or the child’s paternal uncle, or a relative of the child. Here it is as though it suggests that what is intended by that is that the one who was breastfed wants to show beneficence to his milk-mother and to discharge the right he owes her, by giving her a male slave or a female slave to serve her, because she showed beneficence to him while he was small, and she has reached whatever age she has reached; so his giving her someone who serves her and showing beneficence to her as a recompense to her for that is what is meant by the hadith.
This hadith is weak, because in its chain is Ḥajjāj ibn Ḥajjāj, and he is acceptable: his hadith is not used as proof unless he is corroborated, and he has no corroborator here. So the hadith is not established from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ.

So it may be that what is meant is the entire hadith, or that what is meant is that this addition is his wording.

P6759 - Explanation of Sunan Abu Dawud [238]
The Sacred Law has prevented combining a woman with her paternal aunt or her maternal aunt, because of what that contains of resentment and hatred that lead to severing ties and turning away between relatives. This is from the wisdom of the Sacred Law in blocking the avenues of corruption and evil.
It has come that Ali wanted to marry the daughter of Abu Jahl, so the Prophet ﷺ stood as a preacher and clarified that Fatimah is a part of him, and that he fears for her, from that, that she might be tried in her religion. In this too there is blocking the avenues of tribulations and corruption from the servants, let alone relatives.

P6760 - What is disliked to combine between them, from women

P6761 - Explanation of the hadith: “A woman is not married alongside her paternal aunt”
The compiler (may Allah Most High have mercy on him) said: [Chapter: What is disliked to combine between them, from women.
ʻAbd Allāh ibn Muḥammad al-Nufaylī narrated to us; Zuhayr narrated to us; Dāwūd ibn Abī Hind narrated to us, from ʻĀmir, from Abū Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), that he said: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: “A woman is not married alongside her paternal aunt, nor is a paternal aunt alongside her brother’s daughter; nor is a woman alongside her maternal aunt, nor is a maternal aunt alongside her sister’s daughter; and the elder is not married alongside the younger, nor the younger alongside the elder.”]

Abu Dawud cited what is disliked to be combined between from women, meaning: what is unlawful, because “disliked” among the earlier scholars is in the meaning of “unlawful,” as Allah Most High said: “All of that—its evil, with your Lord, is disliked” (al-Isra’ 17:38) after mentioning a number of prohibited matters. So His statement “disliked” means: unlawful.
As for the jurists’ terminology, they make the disliked to be that about which a prohibition came in a manner that is not decisive. It is what the one who leaves it is rewarded for and the one who does it is not punished for, and the Lawgiver sought its abandonment in a non-decisive manner. The unlawful is what the one who leaves it is rewarded for and the one who does it is punished for, and the Lawgiver sought its abandonment decisively. So “disliked” here is in the meaning of unlawful, because combining a woman with her paternal aunt and her maternal aunt is unlawful, and it is not disliked in the sense of discouragement, meaning that it may be done with dislike; rather, it is prohibited, so combining is not permitted. If it occurs, separation is required. Even if that occurred and then it became clear that this is an aunt or a maternal aunt, or there was ignorance of that, then separation between them is obligatory, so the latter one who came later is left, because the contract on the first is valid and the contract on the second is not valid; thus the latter is left.
What is intended by this chapter heading is to clarify what is unlawful to combine between from women. Unlawful combining is only between related women between whom combining is prohibited, such as two sisters, as has come in the Qur’an: “And that you combine between two sisters, except what has already passed” (al-Nisa’ 4:23), whether in marriage or in ownership of the right hand. So two sisters are not combined in marriage: if he marries one of the sisters, then her sister is not lawful for him unless he divorces her and she finishes her waiting period. Even during her waiting period it is not permitted for him to marry her sister, because the revocably divorced woman is a wife; so if he married her sister during her waiting period, he would have combined between the two sisters. Rather, he marries the second only when the first exits her waiting period.
It is known that the waiting period is upon women, but men “observe a waiting period” in two cases that are called “a waiting period” as a riddle: the man “observes a waiting period” when he has a woman and wants to marry her sister; it is not permissible for him to marry her sister until she finishes her waiting period, so he himself waits out this time and does not marry her sister.
The second case is when he has four wives and wants to be rid of one and marry another in her place; it is not permissible for him to marry in place of the fourth until the fourth finishes her waiting period, because if he married in her place while she is in her waiting period, he would have combined between five, since the revocably divorced woman is a wife. So these two situations are posed as riddles, and they say: the man observes a waiting period.
Likewise, in ownership of the right hand, two sisters are not combined in intercourse. As for combining between them in ownership, it is permissible, but in intercourse it is not permissible for him to combine between them.
And Allah Most High’s statement, after mentioning the prohibited women by lineage, by suckling, and by marriage ties: “And it has been permitted to you what is beyond that” (al-Nisa’ 4:24) includes the permissibility of combining a woman with her paternal aunt and combining a woman with her maternal aunt, so the Sunnah came and made an exception from that: combining a woman with her paternal aunt and combining a woman with her maternal aunt.

Finalizing translation and removing truncations
I need to go through the sections that are still truncated, like "Thus the divisions..." and incomplete phrases like "meaning t...". Instead of leaving placeholders or incomplete translations, I'll rewrite them fully and directly. There shouldn't be any trailing ellipses or partial words, so I'll make sure the sentences are complete when crafting the final translation.

Rewriting truncated segments for clarity
I’ll go ahead and fix those problematic segments starting with P6752 and move forward from there. For example, I’ll complete the explanation about the divisions of abrogation—clearing up the ending with "فعلى هذا..." and completing the final thought. I’ll also finalize P6754 and P6757 with full and clear translations. No more incomplete phrases or trailing thoughts.

Clarifying the second and third paragraphs
I'll continue reworking the second paragraph, where the explanation of "A ghurrah" as referring to a slave is clarified. It ties into the beneficence shown in breastfeeding, which is followed by a kind of compensation. Then there's also the third paragraph, focusing on the meaning tied to the child who was breastfed.

Explaining the intent behind the hadith
This suggests that the person who was breastfed is showing gratitude and fulfilling their duty towards the milk-mother by giving her a servant—either a male or female slave. This gesture of beneficence is given back in return for the care and nurturing she provided when he was small.

Clarifying the intent of the hadith and explanation
This suggests that the individual, having been breastfed, shows gratitude to the milk-mother by giving her a servant (either male or female)—to repay the nurturing care she provided when he was small and now, in her old age. Additionally, the hadith chain and explanation need completion and clarification, including omitted content.

final_text3 = """P6750 - Does what is less than five sucklings make unlawful?

P6751 - Explanation of the hadith: “Among what Allah, Mighty and Majestic, sent down of the Qur’an were ten sucklings that make unlawful”
The compiler (may Allah Most High have mercy on him) said: [Chapter: Does what is less than five sucklings make unlawful.
ʻAbd Allāh ibn Maslamah al-Qaʻnabī narrated to us, from Mālik, from ʻAbd Allāh ibn Abī Bakr ibn Muḥammad ibn ʻAmr ibn Ḥazm, from ʻAmrah bint ʻAbd al-Raḥmān, from ʻĀʼishah (may Allah be pleased with her), that she said: Among what Allah, Mighty and Majestic, sent down of the Qur’an were ten sucklings that make unlawful; then they were abrogated by five known sucklings that make unlawful; then the Prophet ﷺ passed away while they were among what was recited of the Qur’an.]

The compiler (may Allah Most High have mercy on him) said: [Chapter: Does what is less than five sucklings make unlawful. The scholars differed regarding the suckling that causes prohibition in three views:
The first view: it is what reaches five sucklings or more. The evidence for that is this hadith which Abu Dawud cited from ʻĀʼishah (may Allah Most High be pleased with her), who said: “Among what Allah, Mighty and Majestic, sent down of the Qur’an were ten sucklings that make unlawful, then they were abrogated by five known sucklings that make unlawful; then the Prophet ﷺ passed away while they were among what was recited of the Qur’an.”
They also argued with the hadith that previously passed concerning the suckling of an adult, in which he said: “Breastfeed him five sucklings.” It is an authentic hadith, but—as is known—it is specific to Salim, the freedman of Abu Hudhayfah. In it, the five are mentioned, so it is evidence that what is considered in suckling is what reaches five sucklings.
The second view: that what makes unlawful is three sucklings or more. They infer that from the hadith that will come, namely his statement: “A single suckle does not make unlawful, nor do two suckles.” They said: its implied meaning indicates that if it is more than that, then it makes unlawful.
The third view: that little and much suckling both make unlawful, because it has come unrestricted in some texts, such as Allah Most High’s statement: “And your mothers who breastfed you, and your sisters through suckling” (al-Nisa’ 4:23). It came unrestricted. They said: thus the little and the much make unlawful.
The correct and preponderant view among these views is the view that what makes unlawful is five sucklings, because what indicates it has come from the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, as in this hadith which Abu Dawud cited, and the hadith that has already preceded concerning the suckling of an adult.
Abu Dawud cited here the hadith of ʻĀʼishah: “Among what Allah, Mighty and Majestic, sent down of the Qur’an were ten sucklings that make unlawful; then they were abrogated by five known sucklings that make unlawful; then the Prophet ﷺ passed away while they were among what was recited of the Qur’an.”
His statement: “while they” means: the five, because the pointing is to the five. There is not in the Qur’an “five sucklings make unlawful,” but in this there is an indication of the closeness of the abrogation to the death of the Messenger ﷺ, and that some people who had not received news of the abrogation continued the recitation until the abrogation reached them, due to its being close to the death of the Messenger ﷺ. So the abrogation came late.]

P6752 - Types of abrogation in the Noble Qur’an
This hadith is evidence that prohibition is only by five sucklings, and it is also evidence for two kinds among the kinds of abrogation in the Noble Qur’an, because abrogation with respect to recitation and ruling is of three divisions:
First: abrogation of both the recitation and the ruling together.
Second: abrogation of the ruling while the recitation remains.
Third: abrogation of the recitation while the ruling remains.
This hadith contains an example of two divisions: abrogation of the recitation and the ruling in the issue of ten known sucklings that make unlawful, because the ruling and the recitation were abrogated: the ruling is abrogated and the recitation is abrogated.
And “five sucklings make unlawful” was such that its recitation was abrogated while the ruling remained.
An example of the third division—abrogation of the ruling while the recitation remains—is the verse about the waiting period of the woman whose husband dies being a full year, namely Allah Most High’s statement: “And those of you who die and leave wives: a bequest for their wives, provision for a year, without expulsion” (al-Baqarah 2:240). Its ruling is abrogated while its recitation remains, and what abrogated it is the verse before it, namely that they wait four months and ten days.
Thus the divisions of abrogation with respect to recitation and ruling are three: abrogation of recitation and ruling; abrogation of recitation while the ruling remains (and the hadith we have is a witness to these two); and the third division is abrogation of the ruling while the recitation remains, as a verse.

P6754 - Explanation of the hadith: “A single suckle does not make unlawful, nor do two suckles”
The compiler (may Allah Most High have mercy on him) said: [Musaddad ibn Musarhad narrated to us; Ismāʻīl narrated to us, from Ayyūb, from Ibn Abī Mulaykah, from ʻAbd Allāh ibn al-Zubayr (may Allah be pleased with them both), from ʻĀʼishah (may Allah be pleased with her), that she said: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: “A single suckle does not make unlawful, nor do two suckles.”]

Abu Dawud cited the hadith of ʻĀʼishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet ﷺ said: “A single suckle does not make unlawful, nor do two suckles,” meaning: one suckling and two sucklings. This is explicitly stated here, but her statement, “then they were abrogated by five known sucklings that make unlawful,” indicates that what is less than it does not make unlawful, whether the one or the two explicitly stated in this hadith, or the third and the fourth that are not explicitly stated in the hadith, since they are less than the five that came in the hadith that it makes unlawful.

P6756 - The gratuity at weaning

P6757 - Explanation of the hadith clarifying removal of the obligation of suckling by a ghurrah
The compiler (may Allah Most High have mercy on him) said: [Chapter: On the gratuity at weaning.
ʻAbd Allāh ibn Muḥammad al-Nufaylī narrated to us; Abū Muʻāwiyah narrated to us.
Ḥ: And Ibn al-ʻAlāʼ narrated to us; Ibn Idrīs narrated to us, from Hishām ibn ʻUrwah, from his father, from Ḥajjāj ibn Ḥajjāj, from his father (may Allah be pleased with him), that he said: I said: O Messenger of Allah! What will remove from me the obligation of suckling? He said: “A ghurrah: a male slave or a female slave.”
Al-Nufaylī said: Ḥajjāj ibn Ḥajjāj al-Aslamī.
This is its wording.]

Abu Dawud brought this chapter heading, namely [Chapter: the gratuity at weaning]. The gratuity is what is given to the wet nurse upon completion of the nursing, when her task ends and her connection with those for whom she breastfed ends. They give her her wage and they give her a gratuity not agreed upon. Part of perfect beneficence and perfect dealings is that they honor her and gift her something besides the wage that they agreed with her upon. This is what is meant by the gratuity: that she is given something besides what was agreed upon as her wage.
In this there is the hadith of Ḥajjāj ibn Ḥajjāj al-Aslamī from his father, that he said: “O Messenger of Allah! What will remove from me the obligation of suckling?” The obligation of suckling is its right and its bond of obligation; what is meant by it is the right and the known favor that came from the wet nurse. So what will remove it from me if I do it? Is it beneficence in return for beneficence? He said: “A ghurrah,” meaning: a slave, because just as she showed beneficence to the child when he was small and breastfed him, she is given something that removes that right, and the person has fulfilled the right due from him.
If what is meant by it is the child who was breastfed, then that would not be at weaning; rather, it would only be later, meaning that if the nursling wants to show beneficence, he will not show beneficence except after a later time. So the gratuity at weaning is intended to be from the one who hired her, who is the child’s father, or the child’s mother, or the child’s paternal uncle, or a relative of the child. Here it is as though it suggests that what is intended by that is that the one who was breastfed wants to show beneficence to his milk-mother and fulfill the right he owes her, by giving her a male slave or a female slave to serve her; because she showed beneficence to him when he was small, and she has reached of old age what she has reached. So his giving her someone to serve her and show beneficence to her, as recompense for that, is what is intended by the hadith.
This hadith is weak, because in its chain is Ḥajjāj ibn Ḥajjāj, and he is acceptable: his hadith is not used as proof unless he is corroborated, and he has no corroborator here. So the hadith is not established from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ.

[From Ḥajjāj ibn Ḥajjāj].
Ḥajjāj ibn Ḥajjāj is acceptable; Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi, and al-Nasa’i recorded his hadith.
[From his father].
His father is a Companion; only this single hadith was recorded from him, and Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi, and al-Nasa’i recorded it.
His statement: [Al-Nufaylī said: Ḥajjāj ibn Ḥajjāj al-Aslamī].
Al-Nufaylī is his first shaykh, meaning that he ascribed him, saying: al-Aslamī. Then Abu Dawud said: [This is its wording], meaning: this hadith is the wording and narration of the first shaykh, namely al-Nufaylī.
So it may be that what is meant is the entire hadith, or that what is meant is that this addition is his wording.

P6759 - Explanation of Sunan Abu Dawud [238]
The Sacred Law has prevented combining a woman with her paternal aunt or her maternal aunt, because of what that contains of resentment and hatred that lead to severing ties and turning away between relatives. This is from the wisdom of the Sacred Law in blocking the avenues of corruption and evil.
It has come that Ali wanted to marry the daughter of Abu Jahl, so the Prophet ﷺ stood as a preacher and clarified that Fatimah is a part of him, and that he fears for her, from that, that she might be tried in her religion. In this too there is blocking the avenues of tribulations and corruption from the servants, let alone relatives.

P6760 - What is disliked to combine between them, from women

P6761 - Explanation of the hadith: “A woman is not married alongside her paternal aunt”
The compiler (may Allah Most High have mercy on him) said: [Chapter: What is disliked to combine between them, from women.
ʻAbd Allāh ibn Muḥammad al-Nufaylī narrated to us; Zuhayr narrated to us; Dāwūd ibn Abī Hind narrated to us, from ʻĀmir, from Abū Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), that he said: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: “A woman is not married alongside her paternal aunt, nor is a paternal aunt alongside her brother’s daughter; nor is a woman alongside her maternal aunt, nor is a maternal aunt alongside her sister’s daughter; and the elder is not married alongside the younger, nor the younger alongside the elder.”]

Abu Dawud cited what is disliked to be combined between from women, meaning: what is unlawful, because “disliked” among the earlier scholars is in the meaning of “unlawful,” as Allah Most High said: “All of that—its evil, with your Lord, is disliked” (al-Isra’ 17:38) after mentioning a number of prohibited matters. So His statement “disliked” means: unlawful.
As for the jurists’ terminology, they make the disliked to be that about which a prohibition came in a manner that is not decisive: it is what the one who leaves it is rewarded for and the one who does it is not punished for; the Lawgiver sought its abandonment in a non-decisive manner. The unlawful is what the one who leaves it is rewarded for and the one who does it is punished for; the Lawgiver sought its abandonment decisively. So “disliked” here is in the meaning of unlawful, because combining a woman with her paternal aunt or her maternal aunt is unlawful, not disliked in the sense of being merely discouraged such that it may be done with dislike. Rather, it is forbidden: combining is not permissible. If it occurs, separation is obligatory. If it happened and then it became clear that she is an aunt (paternal or maternal), or there was ignorance of that, then separation between them is obligatory: the last one who came later is left, because the contract upon the first is valid while the contract upon the second is invalid, so the last one is left.
What is intended by this chapter heading is to clarify what is unlawful to combine between from women. Unlawful combining is only between related women between whom combining is prohibited, such as two sisters, as has come in the Qur’an: “And that you combine between two sisters, except what has already passed” (al-Nisa’ 4:23), whether in marriage or in ownership of the right hand. So two sisters are not combined in marriage: if he marries one of the sisters, then her sister is not lawful for him unless he divorces her and her waiting period ends. Even during her waiting period, it is not permissible for him to marry her sister, because the revocably divorced woman is a wife; so if he married her sister during her waiting period, he would thereby have combined between the two sisters. Rather, he marries the second only when the first exits her waiting period.
It is known that the waiting period is upon women, but men “observe a waiting period” in two cases that are called “a waiting period” as a riddle. The man “observes a waiting period” if he has a woman and wants to marry her sister: it is not permissible for him to marry her sister until she finishes her waiting period, so he himself waits out this time and does not marry her sister.
The second case is when he has four wives and wants to be rid of one and marry another in her place: it is not permissible for him to marry in place of the fourth until the fourth finishes her waiting period, because if he married in her place while she is in her waiting period, he would have combined between five, since the revocably divorced woman is a wife. So these two situations are posed as riddles, and they say: the man observes a waiting period.
Likewise, in ownership of the right hand, two sisters are not combined in intercourse. As for combining between them in ownership, it is permissible, but in intercourse it is not permissible for him to combine between them.
And Allah Most High’s statement, after mentioning the prohibited women by lineage, by suckling, and by marriage ties: “And it has been permitted to you what is beyond that” (al-Nisa’ 4:24) includes the permissibility of combining a woman with her paternal aunt and combining a woman with her maternal aunt, so the Sunnah came and made an exception from that: combining a woman with her paternal aunt and combining a woman with her maternal aunt.

59-ح: وحدثنا ابن العلاء حدثنا ابن إدريس عن هشام بن عروة عن أبيه عن حجاج بن حجاج عن أبيه رضي الله عنه أنه قال: قلت: يا رسول الله! ما يذهب عني مذمة الرضاعة؟ قال: (الغرة العبد أو الأمة).
60-قال النفيلي: حجاج بن حجاج الأسلمي.
61-وهذا لفظه].
62-أورد أبو داود هذه الترجمة، وهي [باب الرضخ عند الفصال]، والرضخ هو ما تعطاه المرضعة عند تمام الإرضاع، حيث تنتهي مهمتها وتنتهي علاقتها بمن أرضعت لهم، فيعطونها أجرتها ويرضخون لها شيئاً غير متفق عليه، فمن تمام الإحسان وتمام المعاملة أنهم يكرمونها ويتحفونها بشيء غير الأجرة التي اتفقوا معها عليها، فهذا هو المقصود بالرضخ، أي أنها تعطى شيئاً غير الذي اتفق عليه على أنه أجرة لها.
63-وقد جاء في هذا حديث حجاج بن حجاج الأسلمي عن أبيه أنه قال: [يا رسول الله! ما يذهب عني مذمة الرضاعة؟]، ومذمة الرضاع حقه وذمامه، والمقصود به الحق والمعروف الذي حصل من المرضعة، فما الذي يذهبه عني إذا فعلته؟ وهو إحسان في مقابل إحسان؟ قال: (غرة) يعني: عبداً؛ لأنه كما أنها قامت بالإحسان إلى الطفل في حال صغره وقامت بإرضاعه فإنها تعطى شيئاً يذهب ذلك الحق، ويكون الإنسان قد أدى الحق الذي عليه.
64-فإذا كان المقصود به الطفل الذي أرضع فهذا لا يكون عند الفصال، بل لا يكون إلا متأخراً، أعني إذا أراد الرضيع أن يحسن فهو لن يحسن إلا بعد زمن متأخر، فالرضخ عند الفصال يقصد به أنه من المستأجر الذي هو والد الطفل أو أم الطفل أو عم الطفل أو قريب الطفل، وهنا كأنه يشعر بأن المقصود بذلك أن الذي أرضع يريد أن يحسن إلى أمه من الرضاعة، ويؤدي لها الحق الذي عليه، وذلك بأن يعطيها عبداً أو أمة تخدمها؛ لأنها قامت بالإحسان إليه في حال صغره، وقد بلغت من الكبر ما بلغت، فكونه يعطيها من يخدمها ويقوم بالإحسان إليها مكافأة لها على ذلك هو المقصود من الحديث.

88:P6759 - شرح سنن أبي داود [٢٣٨]
89-لقد منع الشرع من الجمع بين المرأة وعمتها أو خالتها؛ لما في ذلك من وجود الشحناء والبغضاء التي تؤدي إلى القطيعة والتدابر بين الأقارب، وهذا من حكمة الشرع في سد أبواب الفساد والشر.
90-وقد جاء أن علياً أراد أن ينكح بنت أبي جهل، فقام النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم خطيباً وبين أن فاطمة بضعة منه، وأنه يخاف عليها من ذلك أن تفتن في دينها، وهذا فيه أيضاً سد أبواب الفتن والفساد على العباد بلْهَ عن الأقارب.

92-P6760 - ما يكره أن يجمع بينهن من النساء
93-
94-P6761 - شرح حديث: (لا تنكح المرأة على عمتها)
95-قال المصنف رحمه الله تعالى: [باب ما يكره أن يجمع بينهن من النساء.
96-حدثنا عبد الله بن محمد النفيلي حدثنا زهير حدثنا داود بن أبي هند عن عامر عن أبي هريرة رضي الله عنه أنه قال: قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم: (لا تنكح المرأة على عمتها، ولا العمة على بنت أخيها، ولا المرأة على خالتها، ولا الخالة على بنت أختها، ولا تنكح الكبرى على الصغرى، ولا الصغرى على الكبرى)].
97-أورد أبو داود ما يكره من أن يجمع بينه من النساء، يعني: ما يحرم؛ لأن الكراهة عند المتقدمين بمعنى التحريم، كما قال تعالى: {كُلُّ ذَلِكَ كَانَ سَيِّئُهُ عِنْدَ رَبِّكَ مَكْرُوهًا} [الإسراء: ٣٨] بعد ذكر عدد من المحرمات.
98-فقوله تعالى (مَكْرُوهًا) أي: محرماً.
99-وأما في اصطلاح الفقهاء فإنهم يجعلون المكروه هو الذي جاء النهي عنه على وجه لا جزم فيه، وهو ما يثاب تاركه ولا يعاقب فاعله، وطلب الشارع تركه طلباً غير جازم، والمحرم هو ما يثاب تاركه ويعاقب فاعله، وطلب الشارع تركه طلباً جازماً، فالكراهة هنا بمعنى التحريم؛ لأن الجمع بين المرأة وعمتها وخالتها محرم وليس مكروهاً تنزيهاً بمعنى أنه يجوز أن يفعل مع الكراهة، وإنما هو ممنوع فلا يجوز الجمع، ولو حصل وجب التفريق، ولو أنه وجد ثم تبين أن هذه عمة أو خالة أو حصل جهل بذلك فإنه يجب التفريق بينهما، فتترك الأخيرة التي جاءت أخيراً؛ لأن العقد على الأولى صحيح، والعقد على الثانية غير صحيح، فتترك الأخيرة.
100-والمقصود من هذه الترجمة بيان ما يحرم أن يجمع بينه من النساء، والجمع المحرم إنما هو بين النساء القريبات المحرم الجمع بينهن، كأن تكونا أختين، كما جاء في القرآن: {وَأَنْ تَجْمَعُوا بَيْنَ الأُخْتَيْنِ إِلَّا مَا قَدْ سَلَفَ} [النساء: ٢٣] سواءٌ أكان في الزواج أم في ملك اليمين، فلا يُجمع بين الأختين في الزواج فإذا تزوج إحدى الأختين فلا تحل له أختها إلا إذا طلقها وانتهت من العدة، حتى في حال عدتها لا يجوز له أن يتزوجها؛ لأن المطلقة الرجعية زوجة، فلو تزوج أختها في حال عدتها فإنه يكون بذلك قد جمع بين الأختين، وإنما يتزوج بالثانية عندما تخرج الأولى من العدة، ومعلوم أن العدة على النساء، والرجال يعتدون في حالتين يطلق عليهما عدة على سبيل الإلغاز، فالرجل يعتد إذا كانت عنده امرأة فيريد أن يتزوج أختها، فليس له أن يتزوج أختها حتى تفرغ من العدة، فهو نفسه يتربص هذه المدة فلا يتزوج بأختها.
101-والمسألة الثانية: إذا كان عنده أربع وأراد أن يتخلص من واحدة وينكح مكانها أخرى، فليس له أن يتزوج بدل الرابعة إلا إذا فرغت الرابعة من العدة؛ لأنه لو تزوج بدلها وهي في العدة فقد جمع بين خمس، فالرجعية زوجة، فهاتان الصورتان يلغزون بهما ويقولون: الرجل يعتد.
102-وكذلك في ملك اليمين لا يجمع بين أختين في الوطء، وأما أن يجمع بينهما في الملك فجائز، لكن الوطء ليس له أن يجمع فيه بينهما.
103-وقوله تعالى بعدما ذكر المحرمات من النسب ومن الرضاعة ومن المصاهرة: {وَأُحِلَّ لَكُمْ مَا وَرَاءَ ذَلِكُمْ} [النساء: ٢٤] يشمل إباحة الجمع بين المرأة وعمتها والمرأة وخالتها، فجاءت السنة واستثنت من ذلك الجمع بين المرأة وعمتها والمرأة وخالتها.

15:P6752 - أنواع النسخ في القرآن الكريم
16-هذا الحديث دليل على أن التحريم إنما يكون بخمس رضعات، وهو أيضاً دليل لنوعين من أنواع النسخ في القرآن الكريم؛ لأن النسخ بالنسبة للتلاوة والحكم ثلاثة أقسام: الأول: نسخ التلاوة والحكم جميعاً.
17-الثاني: نسخ الحكم مع بقاء التلاوة.
18-الثالث: نسخ التلاوة مع بقاء الحكم.
19-وهذا الحديث فيه مثال لقسمين هما: نسخ التلاوة والحكم في مسألة عشر رضعات معلومات يحرمن؛ لأنه نسخ الحكم والتلاوة، فالحكم منسوخ والتلاوة منسوخة.
20-وخمس رضعات يحرمن نسخت فيها التلاوة وبقي الحكم.
21-ومثال القسم الثالث -نسخ الحكم مع بقاء التلاوة- آية اعتداد المتوفى عنها بسنة كاملة، وهي قوله تعالى: {وَالَّذِينَ يُتَوَفَّوْنَ مِنْكُمْ وَيَذَرُونَ أَزْوَاجًا وَصِيَّةً لِأَزْوَاجِهِمْ مَتَاعًا إِلَى الْحَوْلِ غَيْرَ إِخْرَاجٍ} [البقرة: ٢٤٠] فهذه منسوخة الحكم باقية التلاوة، والذي نسخها هو الآية التي قبلها، وهي تربص أربعة أشهر وعشراً، فعلى هذا تكون أقسام النسخ بالنسبة للتلاوة والحكم ثلاثة: نسخ تلاوة وحكم، ونسخ تلاوة مع بقاء الحكم، والحديث الذي معنا شاهد للاثنين.

Translating P6752 and finding P6757 content
I’ll go ahead and properly translate P6752 using lines 16-22. After that, I need to locate the content for P6757. I’ll search around the P6757 lines, especially 62, and examine the remaining content from there.

Translating Arabic text with ALA-LC transliteration for narrators
The user wants me to translate Arabic text while preserving full chains of narration. For narrators' names in the isnad segments, I’ll use ALA-LC transliteration (e.g., al-Qaʿnabī for القعنبي). However, I won’t transliterate the rest of the text content. I will also apply this rule to biographical notes if needed.

Translating narrator names with ALA-LC in the chain
The user is clear: only transliterate narrator names using ALA-LC within the chain. For other instances, we can use Latin script versions like "Abdullah ibn Umar" without diacritics. To avoid inconsistency, sticking to the rule for narration chains seems best, even if this introduces inconsistency outside the chains.

Translating with ALA-LC and guidelines on Arabic content
I'll transliterate narrator names using ALA-LC with diacritics but leave other Arabic words in English. For verse citations, I'll transliterate, keeping "Allah" and "ﷺ" (for صلى الله عليه وسلم) as specified. No Arabic characters will be used, except for specific elements like "ﷺ".

Handling surah names, verses, and citations in plain text
Arabic surah names can include diacritics, but no Arabic letters in the response. I'll keep verse numbers and translate content inside braces. I'll also align numeric markers like P7151 with the translation. For the filecite, I'll include it in plain text as required, despite the special markup.

Translating content and keeping technical terms intact
I'll follow the user’s instructions by keeping segment IDs (like P7151) and preserving bracketed chain segments. I'll use ALA-LC transliteration for narrator names with diacritics and avoid Arabic text in the response. I'll translate terms like "الأسانيد العالية" and "مخضرم" using English equivalents but may keep key terms in transliteration where appropriate. We’ll ensure accuracy with terminology.

Handling the term 'mukhaḍram'
The instruction specifies ALA-LC transliteration only for narrator names, but the term "mukhaḍram" is a technical term from hadith sciences. Since there's no direct English equivalent, I'll translate it as "mukhaḍram" with a brief description (a person who lived in both pre-Islamic and Islamic eras but didn't meet the Prophet). This approach balances the instruction while ensuring accuracy.

Handling transliterations and translations
For "فقهاء المدينة السبعة," I'll use "the Seven Jurists of Madinah," which fits. "عمل اليوم والليلة" is a book title, so I'll use "al-ʿAmal al-Yawm wa-l-Laylah" but also offer "The Deeds of the Day and Night" for clarity. Titles like "الزهري" should be transliterated, and phrases like "فمه" will be interpreted as "be silent" or "stop," aligning with the context.

Translating terms and titles carefully
The expression "فَمَهْ" (famah) means "be quiet" or "stop." For "استحمق," the translation would be "acted foolishly." "ركب رأسه" translates as "became stubborn." "الحلْواني" is transliterated. As for the phrase "قبل عدتها," it means "before her ʿiddah," and "الطلاق للعدة كما أمر الله" would be translated to “divorce for the ʿiddah as Allah commanded." We'll also include chapter headings, starting with the ID followed by the translation.

Translating Arabic names and terms carefully
I need to ensure there are no Arabic quotes. Inside brackets, I’ll translate, keeping the brackets intact and using ALA-LC for names, like "[al-Qaʿnabī narrated to us, from Mālik, from Nāfiʿ]."

For names, I'll keep diacritics like ā, ī, and ʿ. When it comes to Allah, I'll use "Allāh" for names, and "Allah" without diacritics for references to God, as per the instruction. Also, I will translate "عز وجل" as "Allah, Mighty and Majestic".

Translating religious phrases consistently
I’ll continue using "Allah, Mighty and Majestic" for translations. Standard phrases like "رضي الله عنه" will be "may Allah be pleased with him," and "رحمه الله تعالى" will be "may Allah the Exalted have mercy on him."

For "صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم," I’ll use just "ﷺ" as instructed, even though it omits "and his family." I’ll also translate hadith in parentheses. For any references to "كتاب الستة," those will be noted as well. Finally, I’ll include the source link in plain text.

Balancing translation and citation format
For terms like "idhkhir," I'd prefer to describe it as "a type of grass" instead of transliterating. For words like "البرزخ" and "الحمى," I'd translate them as "the intermediate realm" and "protected boundary," respectively. Regarding citations, I'll include the source at the end in plain text, as requested.

Opening segments and managing citations
We need more context from segment P10493, particularly lines beyond line 5. I'll open the relevant sections to expand this. Since citations must include line numbers, I'll cite a broader range for accuracy, maybe lines 1-100, without cluttering the translation with too many citations.

Opening full file for citation and translation
We need to ensure at least one citation is included, which we’ll place at the end with a range that covers the entire translation. To get accurate line numbers for proper citation, I’ll use full file content with line markers, doing multiple searches and expanding as needed to cover the necessary portions.

Preparing translation and citation
We'll work with the tool output showing full file content with line numbers between L2 to L100. Citations will be at the end as plain text, using (website) to reference the entire segment. For the translation, I’ll handle each segment individually, maintaining narration and interpreting Arabic terms for clarity.

Translating hadith biography segment
In segment P10490, the hadith recounts an order from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ regarding the slain of Uhud, directing their clothing and iron to be removed before burial amidst their blood. It continues with narrations from trustworthy chains, including Ziyād b. Ayyūb, ʿĪsā b. Yūnus, and ʿAlī b. ʿĀṣim.

Translating hadith chain and complexity
The chain continues with narrators like ʿAṭāʾ b. al-Sāʾib, who is truthful but became confused, with his hadith narrated by al-Bukhari and the Sunan compilers. It then mentions Saʿīd b. Jubayr, also trustworthy and narrated by the six authors. The chain touches upon Ibn ʿAbbās, the revered cousin of the Prophet ﷺ, with a note that the hadith chain is weak despite corroborating many hadith on the martyr's washing.

Addressing the chain weaknesses and Hanzalah’s story
The hadith’s weakness stems from ʿAṭāʾ b. al-Sāʾib, who was truthful but became confused, with ʿAlī b. ʿĀṣim narrating from him afterward. ʿAlī is also truthful but prone to persistent mistakes, adding defects to this hadith. Regarding Hanzalah, the martyr known as "the one washed by angels," his washing was due to major impurity, not a precedent for all martyrs.

Clarifying proper washing and narration details
It’s important to note that if someone dies in a state of janabah, they only need one washing, not two. Similarly, the Friday bath can cover the janabah requirement.

The martyrs of Uhud were not washed, buried with their blood, and no prayer was said for them. Regarding the chain, I will transliterate the names correctly.

Translating and explaining names in the chain
For names like Ibn Shihāb, I can keep it as "Ibn Shihāb" in the chain, following standard transliteration (ALA-LC). For the others—Anas b. Mālik, Usāmah b. Zayd al-Laythī—I’ll just use the established forms. Regarding commentary, there’s a discussion on washing martyrs and the funeral prayer.

Translating and explaining hadith narrators
I’m working through a chain of narrators: Wahb al-Miṣrī is trustworthy, and his work is found in six books. Sulaymān b. Dāwūd al-Mahrī is also trustworthy. Usāmah b. Zayd al-Laythī is truthful but sometimes errs. The chain includes Ibn Wahb, and then the meaning of the incident with Hamza is discussed.

Explaining martyr burial and hadith context
The Prophet ﷺ asked about the slain’s Quran knowledge and arranged their burial in a single grave, with groups shrouded in one garment. Regarding Hamza’s mutilation, he said he would have left the body for birds to consume, a gesture expressing martyrdom's unique treatment. The shortage of shrouds led to shared garments and makeshift coverings.

Explaining Martyr Burial and Grave Practices
Some hadith mention how Mus'ab b. 'Umayr was buried with only a small cloth that didn’t cover his head and feet completely. The Prophet ﷺ recommended placing it on his head and using a plant, idhkhir, at his feet. The hadith also allow burying groups in one grave in circumstances of necessity.

Discussing Zayd b. al-Ḥubbāb's narrations and terminology
Zayd b. al-Ḥubbāb is recognized as truthful, and al-Bukhari recorded his narration in "The Section on Recitation." Muslim and the Sunan compilers also included his narrations. When discussing "Juz' al-Qirāʾah," it's better to translate as "The Section on Recitation" instead of using the transliteration.

Explaining hadith about burial and covering the dead
The Prophet ﷺ ordered that the slain of Uhud be buried with their blood, without washing. He would place the one with more Quran closer to the grave's niche. Commentary clarifies this hadith, with scholars agreeing on its significance in burial practices. The hadith also emphasizes covering the dead's nakedness during washing.

Clarifying chain of narration and transliteration concerns
The hadith is weak due to discontinuity between narrators—specifically between Ibn Jurayj and Ḥabīb b. Abī Thābit. Additionally, the hadith content includes multiple mentions of exposed thighs and private parts but is weak due to incomplete transmission. When dealing with the chain of narrators, careful attention to transliteration using ALA-LC is key, particularly with names such as "Zayd" and "Ibn Jurayj."

Clear translation guidelines and terminology
I’m processing terms for an accurate translation. For example, we'll translate "أصحاب الكتب الستة" as "the authors of the six books." Timeline and chain adjustments are crucial, especially when dealing with "truthful" as "صدوق," or translating titles and phrases like "Biographies of the narrators in the chain of the hadith" instead of using Arabic terms directly. It'll all be finalized through careful revision.

Clarifying translation and formatting details
I’m refining translations for the text, ensuring terms like "the compiler, may Allah have mercy on him" and "Abu Dawud cited..." are used properly. For biographical segments, I'll ensure bracketed names are translated clearly. Adjustments to transliterations, like "Muḥammad" or "Mawhab," will be made according to guidelines. I'll also focus on contextual accuracy, such as translating "memorized more of the Quran" for clarity.

Evaluating hadith chains and translating Arabic segments
translation = """P10490 - Biographies of the narrators in the chain of the hadith: (The Messenger of Allah ﷺ ordered the slain of Uhud to have the iron and skins removed from them and to be buried with their blood and their garments)
His statement: [Ziyād b. Ayyūb narrated to us].
Ziyād b. Ayyūb is trustworthy; al-Bukhari, Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi, and al-Nasa'i narrated from him.
[And ʿĪsā b. Yūnus].
He is ʿĪsā b. Yūnus al-Ṭarsūsī; he is truthful, and Abu Dawud narrated from him.
[ʿAlī b. ʿĀṣim narrated to us].
ʿAlī b. ʿĀṣim is truthful; he makes mistakes and persists—that is, in the mistake. Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi, and Ibn Majah narrated from him.
[From ʿAṭāʾ b. al-Sāʾib].
ʿAṭāʾ b. al-Sāʾib is truthful; he became confused, and al-Bukhari and the compilers of the Sunan narrated his hadith.
[From Saʿīd b. Jubayr].
Saʿīd b. Jubayr is trustworthy; the authors of the six books narrated from him.
[From Ibn ʿAbbās]: he is ʿAbd Allāh b. ʿAbbās b. ʿAbd al-Muṭṭalib, the cousin of the Prophet ﷺ, one of the four Companions named ʿAbd Allāh, and one of the seven known for narrating many hadith from the Prophet ﷺ.
This hadith’s chain is weak, although not washing the martyrs is established in many hadith. The weakness in the chain is because of ʿAṭāʾ b. al-Sāʾib, for he was truthful but became confused, and ʿAlī b. ʿĀṣim is among those who narrated from him after the confusion. Then, too, ʿAlī b. ʿĀṣim is truthful, makes mistakes, and persists in the mistake. So this hadith has two defects.
The fact that Hanzalah is called “the one washed by the angels,” despite his being a martyr, may Allah be pleased with him, does not indicate that martyrs are washed, because the angels washed him due to major ritual impurity; he went out to fight while in a state of major impurity.
This does not entail that if a man dies while in a state of major impurity he should be washed twice: a washing for major impurity and a washing for the deceased. Rather, a single washing suffices. This is like the bath for Friday and the bath for major impurity: it previously passed in Sunan Abi Dawud that he said: if a man is in a state of major impurity and bathes after dawn has risen, it suffices for the Friday bath, meaning that he intends both this and that.

P10491 - Explanation of the hadith: (That the martyrs of Uhud were not washed, were buried with their blood, and no prayer was performed over them)
The compiler, may Allah have mercy on him, said: [Aḥmad b. Ṣāliḥ narrated to us; Ibn Wahb narrated to us; (ḥ) and Sulaymān b. Dāwūd al-Mahrī narrated to us; Ibn Wahb informed us—and this is his wording—; Usāmah b. Zayd al-Laythī informed me that Ibn Shihāb informed him that Anas b. Mālik, may Allah be pleased with him, narrated to them: (That the martyrs of Uhud were not washed, were buried with their blood, and no prayer was performed over them)].
Abu Dawud cited the hadith of Anas b. Mālik, may Allah be pleased with him, who said: “(Indeed, the martyrs of Uhud were not washed, were buried with their blood, and no prayer was performed over them).” The meaning is that they were not washed; rather, they were buried with their blood, and no prayer was performed over them. This indicates that martyrs are not washed, so that that trace remains as a sign of martyrdom in the path of Allah, Exalted and Mighty.
His statement: “(and no prayer was performed over them).” It has come in some hadith that the Prophet ﷺ prayed over Hamzah, and in some that he prayed over them all. Because of this, the scholars differed regarding the funeral prayer over the martyr: is it performed for him, or not performed for him? Imam Ibn al-Qayyim, may Allah have mercy on him, reconciled them by saying: the Muslim is given a choice between praying over them and leaving that, for if he prays over them, there is what indicates that; and if he does not pray over them, there is what indicates that. Thus the matter is one of choice. But praying over them is more fitting if possible, for it is an increase of good because of the supplication it contains.
As for washing, then—as we have known—they are not washed, so that that blood remains as a sign by which they are recognized on the Day of Resurrection.
Accordingly, praying over them is not obligatory as it is for others. For others, the prayer over him is obligatory as a communal obligation, for the funeral prayer is among the communal obligations; but as for the martyrs, it is permissible to pray over them and permissible to leave it, and praying over them is more fitting.

P10492 - Biographies of the narrators in the chain of the hadith: (That the martyrs of Uhud were not washed, were buried with their blood, and no prayer was performed over them)
His statement: [Aḥmad b. Ṣāliḥ narrated to us].
He is Aḥmad b. Ṣāliḥ al-Miṣrī, and he is trustworthy; al-Bukhari, Abu Dawud, and al-Tirmidhi in al-Shama'il narrated from him.
[Ibn Wahb narrated to us].
He is ʿAbd Allāh b. Wahb al-Miṣrī; he is trustworthy, a jurist; the authors of the six books narrated from him.
[(ḥ) and Sulaymān b. Dāwūd al-Mahrī narrated to us].
He is Sulaymān b. Dāwūd al-Mahrī al-Miṣrī; he is trustworthy; Abu Dawud and al-Nasa'i narrated from him.
[Ibn Wahb informed us, and this is his wording].
Meaning: the wording is that of Sulaymān, because Ibn Wahb narrates from him through both routes.
[Usāmah b. Zayd al-Laythī informed me].
Usāmah b. Zayd al-Laythī is truthful; he errs. Al-Bukhari narrated from him in suspended form, and Muslim and the compilers of the Sunan narrated from him.
[That Ibn Shihāb informed him].
He is Muḥammad b. Muslim b. ʿUbayd Allāh b. Shihāb al-Zuhrī; he is trustworthy; the authors of the six books narrated from him.
[That Anas b. Mālik narrated to them].
Anas b. Mālik, may Allah be pleased with him, was a Companion of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and his servant, and one of the seven known for narrating many hadith from the Prophet ﷺ.

P10493 - Explanation of the hadith: (That the Messenger of Allah ﷺ passed by Hamzah and he had been mutilated)
The compiler, may Allah have mercy on him, said: [ʿUthmān b. Abī Shaybah narrated to us; Zayd—meaning Ibn al-Ḥubbāb—narrated to us; (ḥ) and Qutaybah b. Saʿīd narrated to us; Abū Ṣafwān—meaning al-Marwānī—narrated to us; from Usāmah, from al-Zuhrī, from Anas b. Mālik, may Allah be pleased with him, with the meaning: that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ passed by Hamzah, may Allah be pleased with him, and he had been mutilated, so he said: (Were it not that Ṣafiyyah, may Allah be pleased with her, would feel something in herself, I would have left him until the birds ate him, until he would be resurrected from their bellies; and the garments were few and the slain were many, so the man, and the two men, and the three were shrouded in a single garment).
Qutaybah added: (Then they were buried in a single grave, and the Messenger ﷺ used to ask: which of them has more Quran? and he would put him toward the qiblah).]
Abu Dawud cited the hadith of Anas, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Prophet ﷺ said, when he saw Hamzah and he had been mutilated: “(Were it not that Ṣafiyyah …),” and she is the paternal aunt of the Messenger and the sister of Hamzah.
His statement: “(Were it not that Ṣafiyyah would feel something in herself, I would have left him until the birds ate him)”: that is, he would leave him until he would be resurrected from their bellies. This is the reason for citing it in this chapter: namely, that the martyr is not washed, because his statement “(I would have left him)” means: I would not have washed him.
I do not know the basis for his statement: “(until the birds ate him, and until he would be resurrected from their bellies),” for it is well known that the dead—martyrs and others—are all buried in the earth. So the Messenger ﷺ saying, concerning Hamzah: “(Were it not that Ṣafiyyah would feel something in herself, I would have left him until the birds ate him, and until he would be resurrected from their bellies)”—I do not know the basis of that.
His statement: “(and the garments were few and the slain were many)”: that is, they did not have shrouds sufficient for all of them, so a group would be shrouded with a single garment. The meaning of being shrouded with a single garment is that a garment that would suffice one person would be divided between two or three; it does not mean that they were all wrapped in one garment. Rather, it would cover the head of the deceased, meaning that one begins from the side of his head, and if something remains on the side of his legs, it is covered with tree leaves or the like, as has come in some hadith in the story of Mus'ab b. ʿUmayr: they did not find anything to shroud him with except a small piece; if they put it over his head his legs would appear, and if they put it over his legs his head would appear. So the Prophet ﷺ said: “Place it over his head, and place some grass over his legs.”
In the hadith also is the permissibility of burying a group in a single grave, and that is permissible when there is need, such as when the dead are many, for then digging graves for everyone at one time is difficult. This is something the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ brought, as in this hadith.
His statement: “(Then they were buried in a single grave, and the Messenger ﷺ used to ask: which of them has more Quran? and he would put him toward the qiblah)”: this indicates the virtue of the bearer of the Quran.
It has become widespread among people to bury children beside the dead, hoping that the deceased will be shown mercy because of their proximity. This is not legislated. There is no harm in it when there is need, but when there is no need there is no basis for it. Some people do this, and you find them eager, when a man and a child die, to bury the child with the man, to “keep him company.” From where do people get these beliefs? A person is not kept company in his grave except by righteous deeds. As for anything else, nothing has come to indicate it. Rather, as is known, the one in bliss is in bliss and the one punished is punished, even if they are in a single grave: this one does not know about the punishment of that one, and that one does not know about the bliss of this one. The matters of the grave are from the matters of the intermediate realm whose modality is not known, and its modality is not sought. Rather, one must affirm everything that has come from the Prophet ﷺ even if we do not grasp the essence and the modality.

The compiler cited the hadith through another route, and in it: “(that he brought together the two men from among the slain of Uhud in one garment)” at the time of shrouding, but it is as though what is intended is: in a single grave.

P10499 - Concealing the deceased when washing him

P10500 - Explanation of the hadith: (Do not expose your thigh, and do not look at the thigh of a living person or a dead person)
The compiler, may Allah have mercy on him, said: [Chapter on concealing the deceased when washing him.
ʿAlī b. Sahl al-Ramlī narrated to us; Ḥajjāj narrated to us, from Ibn Jurayj: I was informed from Ḥabīb b. Abī Thābit, from ʿĀṣim b. Ḍamrah, from ʿAlī, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Prophet ﷺ said: (Do not expose your thigh, and do not look at the thigh of a living person or a dead person)].
Imam Abu Dawud al-Sijistani, may Allah have mercy on him, brought a chapter on concealing the deceased when washing him; meaning that his nakedness is covered when he is washed. The nakedness is from the navel to the knee, and the washing is done beneath the covering that is over the nakedness. As for what is outside the nakedness, there is no harm in it being uncovered, such as his calves and what is above his navel.
Abu Dawud, may Allah have mercy on him, related the hadith of ʿAlī, may Allah be pleased with him, ascribed to the Prophet ﷺ: “(Do not expose your thigh, and do not look at the thigh of a living person or a dead person).” The point of evidence in this hadith is his statement: “(or a dead person).” The hadith is weak because there is a break between Ibn Jurayj and Ḥabīb b. Abī Thābit; and it has also been said that there is a break between Ḥabīb b. Abī Thābit and ʿAlī. For Ḥabīb b. Abī Thābit would narrate with omitted links and conceal intermediaries, and the break between Ibn Jurayj and Ḥabīb b. Abī Thābit is clear and evident: Ibn Jurayj said, “I was informed from Ḥabīb b. Abī Thābit,” so the one who informed him is not mentioned; thus there is a deleted intermediary. So the hadith is weak.
However, mention of the thigh and the nakedness has come in multiple hadith. Shaykh al-Albani, may Allah have mercy on him, said that they reach the level of being usable as evidence when taken together. For in some hadith there is the uncovering of the Prophet’s thigh ﷺ, and in some there is mention of something about the form of his thigh and his calves. And it has come from Anas: “that his thigh ﷺ became uncovered while he was riding his mount, in an alley from the alleys of Khaybar, on the day of the conquest of Khaybar.” Some of the people of knowledge said that this uncovering was because of the intensity of the running of the horse that he ﷺ was riding. It is known that taking precaution in the religion, and acting upon what has come regarding covering the nakedness, being careful about it, not looking at it, and not exposing it, is what one should be keen on.
Some of the people of knowledge said: the nakedness is two kinds: a severe nakedness and a light nakedness. The severe nakedness is the private parts, and the light nakedness is the thighs. So a person should be keen not to expose anything of his nakedness at all, whether severe or light. Even if some of it is more severe than some, it is like a protected boundary: whoever is lax regarding the protected boundary may become lax until he reaches what is severe.

Ensuring full translation without truncation
I realized I unintentionally truncated parts of the text with ellipses to shorten it before. I need to go back and ensure the full, exact translation is used without any omissions. So, I'll carefully re-read the Arabic segments and make sure every part is fully translated. I'll work through the entire content, no abbreviations.

Translating complete text carefully
At P10491, I need to translate the entire sentence about Ibn al-Qayyim's choices without abbreviating. Similarly, for P10493, there’s a long hadith in parentheses, which must be fully translated, including the part about "لولا أن تجد صفية..." and the Qutaybah addition. I'll ensure nothing gets missed, especially the direct quotes, like the Prophet's ﷺ words regarding Mus'ab.

Translating "idhkhir" with clarity
In this context, "idhkhir" refers to a specific plant, but since the instruction is to limit transliteration, I'll choose to translate it as "and place some grass over his feet." It’s a good balance, though it doesn’t capture the precise plant. I could clarify further in a footnote, but I don’t think it’s necessary. Also, "في زقاق من أزقة خيبر" can be translated as "in an alley of Khaybar."

Translating specific terms and names
I’ll translate "في زقاق من أزقة خيبر" as "in an alley from the alleys of Khaybar" and the rhetorical phrase "المنعّم منعَّم، وأن المعذب معذب" as “the one who is blessed is blessed, and the one who is punished is punished." For names, I’ll use ALA-LC diacritics only in the chain and keep non-chain names like Hamzah, Safiyyah, and others standard without diacritics.

Finalizing translation details
When translating, I’ll keep names like "Hamzah" and "Anas b. Mālik" without diacritics for consistency. "Shaykh al-Albani" will also stay without diacritics, and "Imam Ibn al-Qayyim" will be used as written. For phrases like "قوله," I’ll keep “His statement:” and ensure accuracy. I’ll carefully avoid ellipses or omissions, ensuring the full text is included. I'll construct the final translation, carefully checking for truncation or character inconsistencies.

His statement: [Ziyād b. Ayyūb narrated to us].
Ziyād b. Ayyūb is trustworthy; al-Bukhari, Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi, and al-Nasa'i narrated from him.
[And ʿĪsā b. Yūnus].
He is ʿĪsā b. Yūnus al-Ṭarsūsī; he is truthful; Abu Dawud narrated from him.
[ʿAlī b. ʿĀṣim narrated to us].
ʿAlī b. ʿĀṣim is truthful; he makes mistakes and persists—that is, in the mistake. Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi, and Ibn Majah narrated from him.
[From ʿAṭāʾ b. al-Sāʾib].
ʿAṭāʾ b. al-Sāʾib is truthful; he became confused, and al-Bukhari and the compilers of the Sunan narrated his hadith.
[From Saʿīd b. Jubayr].
Saʿīd b. Jubayr is trustworthy; the authors of the six books narrated from him.
[From Ibn ʿAbbās]: he is ʿAbd Allāh b. ʿAbbās b. ʿAbd al-Muṭṭalib, the cousin of the Prophet ﷺ, one of the four Companions named ʿAbd Allāh, and one of the seven known for narrating many hadith from the Prophet ﷺ.
This hadith’s chain is weak, although not washing the martyrs is established in many hadith. The weakness in the chain is because of ʿAṭāʾ b. al-Sāʾib, for he was truthful but became confused, and ʿAlī b. ʿĀṣim is among those who narrated from him after the confusion. Then, too, ʿAlī b. ʿĀṣim is truthful, makes mistakes, and persists in the mistake. So this hadith has two defects.
The fact that Hanzalah is called “the one washed by the angels,” despite his being a martyr, may Allah be pleased with him, does not indicate that martyrs are washed, because the angels washed him due to major ritual impurity; he went out to fight while in a state of major impurity.
This does not entail that if a man dies while in a state of major ritual impurity he should be washed twice: a washing for major ritual impurity and a washing for the deceased. Rather, a single washing suffices. This is like the bath for Friday and the bath for major ritual impurity. It previously passed in Sunan Abi Dawud that he said: if a man is in a state of major ritual impurity and bathes after dawn has risen, it suffices for the Friday bath, meaning that he intends both this and that.

P10491 - Explanation of the hadith: (That the martyrs of Uhud were not washed, were buried with their blood, and no prayer was performed over them)
The compiler, may Allah have mercy on him, said: [Aḥmad b. Ṣāliḥ narrated to us; Ibn Wahb narrated to us; (ḥ) and Sulaymān b. Dāwūd al-Mahrī narrated to us; Ibn Wahb informed us—and this is his wording—; Usāmah b. Zayd al-Laythī informed me that Ibn Shihāb informed him that Anas b. Mālik, may Allah be pleased with him, narrated to them: (That the martyrs of Uhud were not washed, were buried with their blood, and no prayer was performed over them)].
Abu Dawud cited the hadith of Anas b. Mālik, may Allah be pleased with him, who said: [(Indeed, the martyrs of Uhud were not washed, were buried with their blood, and no prayer was performed over them)]. The meaning is that they were not washed; rather, they were buried with their blood, and no prayer was performed over them. This indicates that martyrs are not washed, so that that trace remains as a sign of martyrdom in the path of Allah, Exalted and Mighty.
His statement: [(and no prayer was performed over them)]. It has come in some hadith that the Prophet ﷺ prayed over Hamzah, and in some that he prayed over them all. Because of this, the scholars differed regarding the funeral prayer over the martyr: is it prayed over him, or is it not prayed over him? Imam Ibn al-Qayyim, may Allah have mercy on him, reconciled them by saying: the Muslim is given a choice between praying over them and leaving that. If he prays over them, there has come what indicates that; and if he does not pray over them, there has come what indicates that. So the matter is one of choice. But praying over them is more fitting, if possible, for it is an additional good, because it includes supplication.
As for washing, then—as we have known—they are not washed, so that that blood remains as a sign by which they are recognized on the Day of Resurrection.
Accordingly, praying over them is not obligatory as it is for others. For others, the prayer over him is obligatory as a communal obligation, for the funeral prayer is among the communal obligations. But as for the martyrs, it is permissible to pray over them and permissible to leave it, and praying over them is more fitting.

Usāmah b. Zayd al-Laythī is truthful; he errs. Al-Bukhari narrated from him in suspended form, and Muslim and the compilers of the Sunan narrated from him.

[That Anas b. Mālik narrated to them].
Anas b. Mālik, may Allah be pleased with him, was a Companion of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and his servant, and one of the seven known for narrating many hadith from the Prophet ﷺ.

P10493 - Explanation of the hadith: (That the Messenger of Allah ﷺ passed by Hamzah and he had been mutilated)
The compiler, may Allah have mercy on him, said: [ʿUthmān b. Abī Shaybah narrated to us; Zayd—meaning Ibn al-Ḥubbāb—narrated to us; (ḥ) and Qutaybah b. Saʿīd narrated to us; Abū Ṣafwān—meaning al-Marwānī—narrated to us; from Usāmah, from al-Zuhrī, from Anas b. Mālik, may Allah be pleased with him, with the meaning: that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ passed by Hamzah, may Allah be pleased with him, and he had been mutilated, so he said: (Were it not that Ṣafiyyah, may Allah be pleased with her, would feel something in herself, I would have left him until the birds ate him, until he would be resurrected from their bellies. And the garments were few and the slain were many, so the man, and the two men, and the three would be shrouded with the single garment).
Qutaybah added: (Then they were buried in a single grave, and the Messenger ﷺ used to ask: which of them has more Quran? and he would put him toward the qiblah).]
Abu Dawud cited the hadith of Anas, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Prophet ﷺ said, when he saw Hamzah and he had been mutilated: (Were it not that Ṣafiyyah …), and she is the paternal aunt of the Messenger and the sister of Hamzah.
His statement: (Were it not that Ṣafiyyah would feel something in herself, I would have left him until the birds ate him): that is, he would leave him until he would be resurrected from their bellies. This is the reason for citing it in this chapter: namely, that the martyr is not washed, because his statement (I would have left him) means: I would not have washed him.
I do not know the basis for his statement: (until the birds ate him, and until he would be resurrected from their bellies). For it is well known that the dead—martyrs and others—are all buried in the earth. So the Messenger ﷺ saying, concerning Hamzah: (Were it not that Ṣafiyyah would feel something in herself, I would have left him until the birds ate him, and until he would be resurrected from their bellies)—I do not know the basis of that.
His statement: (and the garments were few and the slain were many) means that they did not have shrouds sufficient for all of them, so a group would be shrouded with the single garment. The meaning of being shrouded with the single garment is that a garment that would suffice one person would be divided between two or three; it does not mean that they were wrapped in a single garment. Rather, it would cover the head of the deceased, meaning that one begins from the side of his head, and if something remains on the side of his legs, it is covered with leaves or the like, as has come in some hadith in the story of Mus'ab b. Umayr: they did not find anything to shroud him with except a small piece, so if they placed it on his head his legs became uncovered, and if they placed it on his legs his head became uncovered. So the Prophet ﷺ said: (Place it on his head, and place some grass on his legs).
In the hadith also is the permissibility of burying a group in a single grave, and that is permissible when there is need, such as when the dead are many and it is difficult to dig graves for everyone at one time. This is something the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ brought, as in this hadith.
His statement: (Then they were buried in a single grave, and the Messenger ﷺ used to ask: which of them has more Quran? and he would put him toward the qiblah): this indicates the virtue of the bearer of the Quran.
It has become widespread among people to bury children beside the dead, hoping that the deceased will be shown mercy because of their proximity. This is not legislated. There is no harm in it when there is need, but when there is no need there is no basis for it. Some people do this, and you find them eager, when a man and a child die, to bury the child with the man, to “keep him company.” From where do people get these beliefs? A person is not kept company in his grave except by righteous deeds. As for other than that, nothing has come indicating it. Rather, as is well known, the one who is granted bliss is in bliss, and the one who is punished is punished, even if they are in a single grave. This one does not know about the punishment of that one, and that one does not know about the bliss of this one. The matters of the grave are among the matters of the intermediate realm whose modality is not known, and its modality is not investigated. Rather, one must believe everything that has come from the Prophet ﷺ, even if we do not grasp the reality and the manner.

Ḍamrah, from ʿAlī, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Prophet ﷺ said: (Do not expose your thigh, and do not look at the thigh of a living person or a dead person)].
Imam Abu Dawud al-Sijistani, may Allah have mercy on him, brought a chapter on concealing the deceased when washing him; meaning that his nakedness is covered when he is washed. The nakedness is from the navel to the knee, and the washing is done beneath the covering that is over the nakedness. As for what is outside the nakedness, there is no harm in it being uncovered, such as his calves and what is above his navel.
Abu Dawud, may Allah have mercy on him, related the hadith of ʿAlī, may Allah be pleased with him, ascribed to the Prophet ﷺ: (Do not expose your thigh, and do not look at the thigh of a living person or a dead person). The point of evidence in this hadith is his statement: (or a dead person). The hadith is weak because there is a break between Ibn Jurayj and Ḥabīb b. Abī Thābit; and it has also been said that there is a break between Ḥabīb b. Abī Thābit and ʿAlī. For Ḥabīb b. Abī Thābit would narrate with omitted links and would conceal intermediaries, and the break between Ibn Jurayj and Ḥabīb b. Abī Thābit is clear and evident, for Ibn Jurayj said: I was informed from Ḥabīb b. Abī Thābit; so the one who informed him is not mentioned, and thus there is an omitted intermediary; so the hadith is weak.
However, mention of the thigh and the nakedness has come in multiple hadith. Shaykh al-Albani, may Allah have mercy on him, said: they reach the level of being usable as evidence when taken together. For in some hadith there is the uncovering of the Prophet’s thigh ﷺ, and in some there is mention of something about the form of his thigh and his calves. And it has come from Anas: (that his thigh ﷺ became uncovered while he was riding his mount, in an alley from the alleys of Khaybar, on the day Khaybar was conquered). Some of the people of knowledge said: this uncovering was due to the intense running of the horse that he was riding ﷺ. And it is known that caution in the religion, and taking what has come regarding covering the nakedness, being careful about it, not looking at it, and not exposing it, is what one should be keen on.
Some of the people of knowledge said: the nakedness is two kinds: a severe nakedness and a light nakedness. The severe nakedness is the private parts, and the light nakedness is the thighs. So a person should be keen not to expose anything of his nakedness at all, whether severe or light. Even if some of it is more severe than some, it is like a protected boundary: whoever is lax regarding the protected boundary may become lax until he reaches what is severe.

Avoiding truncation and ensuring full translation
I realized I’ve been shortening some long passages in my translation by using "..." for line endings. I need to rewrite these sections in full, like the part in P10491, to ensure everything is included. Specifically, I'll complete "If he prays over them, evidence indicates..." to say it more fully, preserving the complete meaning.

Completing the truncated lines
I noticed I left some sentences incomplete in P10493, like "would feel something in herself..." I need to include the full text, which says: "I would have left him until the birds ate him, until he would be resurrected from their bellies." Also, there's more about the garments being few. I need to finish these lines.

Ensuring full translation and completeness
I realized I truncated important parts about shrouding, Mus'ab’s story, and burying children. The full text also needs the phrase, “I am a witness over these on the Day of Resurrection,” and other omitted sections, including those about the chain discontinuity and the events at Khaybar. I’ll manually rewrite these passages from scratch.

Rewriting the truncated passages for completeness
I noticed that parts about shrouding, Mus'ab's story, and burying children were cut off. To fix this, I’ll make sure I include the full details: the words about being a witness on the Day of Resurrection, and the parts from Anas about Khaybar. I’ll use the Arabic original text to complete these passages.

Translating and completing the truncations
I need to make sure the translation includes the entire text without truncating any parts, especially key hadith and stories like those from Mus’ab. For example, in P10491, I’ll fully translate the lines about preference for prayer, and also ensure quotation marks around the hadith such as "اجعلوها على رأسه". As with the burying children story, I’ll include all necessary details.

Translating weak hadith and narrations
I need to translate the explanation of the hadith being weak due to a break in the chain between Ibn Jureij and Habib bin Abi Thabit. The narration's credibility is questioned. I'll also fully translate the details about the thigh and the angle around the Prophet’s appearance, noting cultural aspects of modesty and scholarly interpretations.

Translating specific text about modesty and clarity
I need to translate the explanation about the two types of private parts (severe and light) and emphasize the importance of guarding modesty. The second part talks about "the birds" and clarifies their meaning. I'll also double-check the phrase about two or three men being shrouded in a single cloth to ensure accuracy.

Ensuring consistency in naming and diacritics
I noticed that I’ve been using names consistently, including in the commentary. We also included diacritics for some names like "ʿAbbās b. ʿAbd al-ʿAẓīm" in the biographical explanation. All of this seems consistent with the chain, so now it's time to craft the final translation.

Considering transliteration guidelines for names in hadith chains
It seems the guideline is to transliterate only the names of narrators in the chain, like "Aḥmad ibn Ḥanbal," but not the text itself. For biographies of narrators, I’m not entirely sure, but it may be safer to apply the same rule for consistency—translating names of narrators but not other content.

Clarifying transliteration rules for narrator names and technical terms
I’m considering whether certain phrases like "أحمد بن صالح المصري" should be treated as part of the chain or not. Since it’s outside the chain, I can leave it in English, but still transliterate names inside the chain correctly.

For technical terms like "thiqah," I think they should be translated rather than transliterated, as the guidelines don't mention using the latter on such terms.

Choosing between translation and transliteration for technical terms
It seems like I should generally avoid transliterating technical terms like "muʿallaq" and instead translate them where possible, like "hanging" for "muʿallaq."

While certain Arabic terms are well-known, the instructions are clear on transliterating only names. So I'll stick with English phrasing unless it's necessary to use the established transliteration for certain technical terms.

Balancing accuracy and transliteration preferences
The user prefers the highest accuracy, so I'll stick strictly to translating non-name terms. Instead of using transliteration like "taʿlīqan," I’ll translate it to "disconnected fashion" even though that might lose some technical nuance. For headings or numeric markers, they should be preserved. I'll also ensure that terms like "God" are translated as "Allah," unless it refers to "ilah." Finally, I'll revise the content for accuracy after reading the full file.

Translating and correctly handling Arabic terms in hadith
I’ll ensure I transliterate names in the narration chain, like "Aḥmad ibn Ḥanbal" or "Yaʿqūb ibn Ibrāhīm," but only the names. For terms like "الحقاء," which refers to a waist-wrapper, I'll translate it as "the waist-wrapper" or "the izār" to keep the meaning clear. Arabic quotes, besides ﷺ, must be removed entirely.

Translating terms and month names for clarity
For consistency, I’ll translate words like “إزار” as “waist-wrapper,” sticking to English equivalents for general terms. Terms such as “al-durrāʿ” (shirt) or “al-Khimār” (head-cover) will also be translated. As for months like “Dhu al-Ḥijjah,” I'll go with the transliterated form, since it’s widely recognized, though month names aren't explicitly part of the "name transliteration" rule.

Choosing month translation approach
To adhere strictly to the guidelines, I'd avoid transliterating the month name “Dhu al-Ḥijjah”—even though it’s common. Instead, I could translate it as "the fourth of the month of the Pilgrimage," but that may lose accuracy. Alternatively, I could go with "the fourth of the twelfth month," though that feels ambiguous.

Handling month translation and book names
For months, I’ll avoid transliterating "Dhu al-Ḥijjah" and instead say, “the fourth day of the month of the Pilgrimage (the twelfth lunar month).” This works within the guidelines. Regarding book names like "al-Bukhārī," since those aren’t narrator names, they might not require strict transliteration—I'll follow the ALA-LC convention for Islamic texts where applicable.

Deciding on ALA-LC transliteration rules
For consistency, I think we should follow ALA-LC transliteration with diacritics for narrator names in the chain, as instructed. For other names like book authors or scholars, I’ll use familiar forms without diacritics (e.g., al-Bukhari or Abu Dawod). It's important to stick to the guidelines precisely to avoid inconsistencies.

Ensuring consistency in translations
For consistency, I'll follow the set translation rules. For example, "ḥaddathanā" becomes "narrated to us" and "ʿan" is "from." I'll apply these alongside the correct treatment of Arabic phrases like "رحمه الله" (may Allah have mercy on him). I'll also ensure that bracketed hadith text is translated but retains the brackets.

Clarifying transliteration choices for technical terms
The user only mentioned using ALA-LC transliteration for narrator names. They didn’t specify what to do with technical terms. I’ve used ALA-LC with diacritics for terms like "marfūʿ". It might be better to translate terms to English (e.g., "raised") to avoid issues, but keeping technical terms as is could be crucial for accuracy. Removing diacritics might be a compromise.

Determining approach for technical terms and transliteration
The user specifically wants ALA-LC for narrator names, not for technical terms, so we should avoid using ALA-LC diacritics for non-name words. Translating technical terms into English (like "sahih" to "authentic") might be the best approach, with the Arabic term in parentheses when needed. This avoids full transliteration while keeping it clear.

Deciding on approach for technical terms translation
The technical terms fall within the commentary, not the hadith text itself, but they could still be considered part of the textual content. I think it might be best to translate the technical terms into English, like "marfūʿ" to "raised," while maintaining their meaning. This ensures we respect the user's preference for accuracy without using transliteration for this portion.

Clarifying translation approach for classification terms
Since the user wants to avoid transliterating technical terms and has specified using ALA-LC only for names, I'll keep most terms like "trustworthy" instead of transliterating "thiqah." For terms like "jarh wa taʿdil," I'll retain the transliteration, but I'll avoid adding extra diacritics and focus on clear translations when necessary. This should balance accuracy and the instructions.

Deciding on transliteration for technical terms
I need to decide whether to transliterate technical terms while respecting the user's preference for ALA-LC for narrators' names only. I'll translate terms like "thiqah" as "trustworthy" and use English where possible ("four-narrator chain," "accepted"). I’ll avoid excessive parentheses, and refrain from transliterating non-narrator terms, but keep specific ones like "jarh wa taʿdil" in Arabic.

Clarifying transliteration approach for names and titles
Narrator names should use ALA-LC with diacritics, so I’ll ensure correct transliteration for those within the chain. For non-narrator terms like titles or book names (e.g., "al-Hafiz" or "Fath al-Bari"), I’ll avoid ALA-LC and use simplified transliteration or English translation without diacritics for consistency.

Refining translation and transliteration approach
To align with the instructions, I’ll use ALA-LC transliteration for narrator names in the isnad and biographies but avoid diacritics for non-narrator terms, like technical jargon. I’ll translate terms like "thiqah" as "trustworthy" and others without parentheses for clarity, while simplifying book titles and avoiding unnecessary diacritics.

Clarifying transliteration choices
I’ll follow the rule of using ALA-LC transliteration for narrator names in the chain, but for other terms like "shaykh," I'll leave them untranslated, as they're technical terms. Non-narrator names like scholarly titles can be transliterated more simply, without diacritics, for clarity. I'll also decide on terms like "mutaba'at," choosing translation unless it’s a crucial technical term.

Clarifying transliteration and formatting decisions
The interpretation here is that ALA-LC should be used for transliterating personal names of narrators and scholars, but not for other Arabic terms or Arabic phrases. Book titles can be translated without diacritics and without affecting the overall consistency. Also, I’ll make sure any punctuation and quotes are consistent with the plain-text requirement.

Finalizing diacritics and terminology usage
To stay consistent with the instructions, we’ll apply diacritics strictly to personal names of narrators inside chains. For non-narrator names, book titles, and other terms, we’ll remove diacritics and use common English equivalents or simplified transliterations. This helps maintain both clarity and accuracy in the final translation. We’ll also adjust terminology like “sahih” and “marfu’” accordingly.

Clarifying narrator names and diacritic usage
In biographies, the narrator names are mentioned, but they aren't part of the chain text itself. However, I'll keep diacritics for these names since they are narrators associated with the chain. We'll omit diacritics from book titles and names like al-Bukhari, as they’re not in the chain. Let’s finalize the translation with these adjustments.

Revising hadith transliteration guidelines
final3 = """P13586 - What has been narrated regarding the aqbiyah

P13587 - Explanation of the hadith: (The Messenger of Allah ﷺ distributed aqbiyah)
The compiler, may Allah have mercy on him, said: [Chapter: What has been narrated regarding the aqbiyah.
Qutaybah ibn Saʿīd and Yazīd ibn Khālid ibn Mawhab narrated to us—to the same meaning—that al-Layth (meaning: Ibn Saʿd) narrated to them, from ʿAbd Allāh ibn ʿUbayd Allāh ibn Abī Mulaykah, from al-Miswar ibn Makhramah, may Allah be pleased with them both, that he said: “The Messenger of Allah ﷺ distributed aqbiyah and did not give Makhramah anything. So Makhramah said: ‘O my son! Come, let us go to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ.’ So I went with him. He said: ‘Go in and call him for me.’ He said: So I called him. Then he came out to him while wearing one of those coats. He said: ‘I saved this for you.’ He said: So he looked at it—Ibn Mawhab added: Makhramah; then the two of them agreed—they said: Makhramah was pleased.” Qutaybah said: From Ibn Abī Mulaykah; he did not name him]. 

The aqbiyah are a garment said to be tight-fitting, from the clothing of the non-Arabs; and this is the qabā, with lengthening (madd) and without hamzah. Ibn Ḥajar said in Fath al-Bari: it is a tight garment from the clothing of the non-Arabs.

Abu Dawud cited the hadith of al-Miswar ibn Makhramah, may Allah be pleased with him, that his father said to him: Let us go to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, because aqbiyah had come to him and he did not give Makhramah anything; meaning: he did not send him any of them, even though he had set some aside for him, saved for him one coat, and prepared that for him.

His statement: “he did not give,” meaning: he did not send him anything, but he had kept something for him to give him, as becomes clear from his ﷺ words with Makhramah after he came to him.

So Makhramah asked his son al-Miswar to go with him to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. When they came, he said: “Go in and call him for me,” meaning: so that he would come out to him and speak with him, for someone may be with him and he does not want to speak, in front of people, regarding a matter such as this. So he came out to him wearing one of those coats, and he said: “I saved this for you,” meaning: I kept it back and stored it for you.

[He said: So he looked at it; Ibn Mawhab added: Makhramah].
Meaning: he is the doer of “looked,” i.e., Ibn Mawhab said: “So Makhramah looked at it,” and he mentioned the subject of “looked,” and that it is an explicit noun.
As for Qutaybah, who is the second teacher, he did not mention the subject as an explicit noun.

[Then the two of them agreed; they said: Makhramah was pleased].
The phrase “Makhramah was pleased” could be that the one who said it was the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, and it could be that Makhramah said it. The closer is that Makhramah is the one who said it, meaning: I have become pleased.
And his name was mentioned explicitly in place of the pronoun.
Some manuscripts contain an interrogative: “Is Makhramah pleased?”
So if the interrogative is established, then this is from the statement of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ.
And the interrogative strengthens the possibility that the speaker is the Messenger of Allah ﷺ in the narration in which no interrogative is mentioned.

[Qutaybah said: from Ibn Abī Mulaykah; he did not name him].
Meaning: the one who named him was the second teacher, namely Ibn Mawhab. As for Qutaybah, he said: “from Ibn Abī Mulaykah” and did not name him. But Ibn Mawhab named him and named his father, saying: ʿAbd Allāh ibn ʿUbayd Allāh ibn Abī Mulaykah.

This isnad is four-link, and it is among the highest isnads with Abu Dawud.

P13589 - Sharh Sunan Abi Dawud [452]
Garments of fame call a person to arrogance and to elevating himself above people. In it there is extravagance, vanity, and distinction over others, and it is prohibited; its wearer is exposed to the threat and to the Fire.
As for clothing that is high-priced, it differs from person to person; one looks at its motives, its reasons, and its details. The particulars of its rulings are explained in this entry.

P13590 - What has been narrated regarding wearing the garment of fame

P13591 - Explanation of the hadith: (Whoever wears a garment of fame, Allah will clothe him on the Day of Resurrection with one like it)
The compiler, may Allah have mercy on him, said: [Chapter concerning wearing the garment of fame.
Muḥammad ibn ʿĪsā narrated to us, Abū ʿAwānah narrated to us. H.
And Muḥammad—meaning Ibn ʿĪsā—narrated to us, from Sharīk, from ʿUthmān ibn Abī Zurʿah, from al-Muhājir al-Shāmī, from Ibn ʿUmar, may Allah be pleased with them both—he said in the hadith of Sharīk: he raises it—he said: “Whoever wears a garment of fame, Allah will clothe him on the Day of Resurrection with a garment like it.” Added, from Abū ʿAwānah: “Then the Fire will blaze in it.”]. 

What is meant by fame is that which a person becomes famous for and by which he distinguishes himself from others. It may lead to arrogance because it is expensive, high-priced, and precious, so along with that there is self-aggrandizement, haughtiness, and elevation over people. It may also be something that draws attention, in his distinctive clothing that differs from the clothing of the people of his land and differs from the clothing of his folk.

He, may Allah have mercy on him, cited the hadith of ʿAbd Allāh ibn ʿUmar, may Allah be pleased with them both, as raised (marfu') to the Prophet ﷺ: “Whoever wears a garment of fame, Allah will clothe him on the Day of Resurrection with one like it,” meaning: something by which he becomes famous, but it is in blame and in evil.

[Added, from Abū ʿAwānah: “Then the Fire will blaze in it.”]
Meaning: this garment by which he becomes famous, the Fire will blaze in it, i.e., he will be punished by this garment, or by the like of this garment which he wore and by which arrogance occurred from him. For this reason, in some narrations there occurs: “a garment of humiliation,” meaning: just as arrogance occurred from him, so humiliation will occur for him in the Hereafter in return for that; he will be made to wear a garment of humiliation, so in it there is abasement for him. And in it also is his punishment by it, since in this narration it says: “Then the Fire will blaze in it.”

The garment of fame may be with intent, and it falls under the threat; and it may be without intent, and one fears for him that he may be included in the threat as well, in addition to the fact that he may be suspected regarding his intellect because of that outfit of his.

P13592 - Biographies of the narrators in the isnad of the hadith: (Whoever wears a garment of fame, Allah will clothe him on the Day of Resurrection with one like it)
His statement: [Muḥammad ibn ʿĪsā narrated to us].
Muḥammad ibn ʿĪsā al-Ṭabbāʿ, trustworthy (thiqah); al-Bukhari narrated from him in mu'allaq form, and Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi in al-Shama'il, al-Nasa'i, and Ibn Majah.
[From Abū ʿAwānah].
Abū ʿAwānah al-Waḍḍāḥ ibn ʿAbd Allāh al-Yashkurī, trustworthy (thiqah); the authors of the Six Books narrated from him.
[H and Muḥammad—meaning Ibn ʿĪsā—narrated to us].
He is the first teacher.
[From Sharīk].
Sharīk ibn ʿAbd Allāh al-Nakhaʿī al-Kūfī, the judge: truthful (saduq), but he makes many mistakes; his memory changed because he took up the judgeship. His hadith was narrated by al-Bukhari in mu'allaq form, by Muslim, and by the authors of the Sunan.
[From ʿUthmān ibn Abī Zurʿah].
ʿUthmān ibn Abī Zurʿah is trustworthy (thiqah); al-Bukhari and the authors of the Sunan narrated from him.
[From al-Muhājir al-Shāmī].
Al-Muhājir al-Shāmī—he is al-Muhājir ibn ʿAmr—is acceptable (maqbul); Abu Dawud, al-Nasa'i, and Ibn Majah narrated from him.
[From Ibn ʿUmar].
He is ʿAbd Allāh ibn ʿUmar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb, may Allah be pleased with them both, the eminent Companion, one of the four ʿAbadilah among the Companions, and one of the seven known for abundant narration from the Prophet ﷺ.

[He said in the hadith of Sharīk: he raises it].
It is as though—on this—there is no mention of raising it in the first route, and as though it is stopped (mawquf) at Ibn ʿUmar. As for Sharīk, in the second route he said: “he raises it,” meaning: Ibn ʿUmar attributes it to the Prophet ﷺ; because the phrase “he raises it” is equivalent to “He said: the Messenger of Allah ﷺ,” or “I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ.”

[Added, from Abū ʿAwānah: “Then the Fire will blaze in it.”]
Meaning: an addition in the first route: “Then the Fire will blaze in it.” This addition is not in Sharīk’s route; rather it is in the route of Abū ʿAwānah, which is the first route.

The isnad has been spoken about, and al-Albani graded it authentic (sahih).
Sharīk is coupled (maqrūn), and Abū ʿAwānah is trustworthy (thiqah), but in it is al-Muhājir al-Shāmī, who is acceptable (maqbul) according to the method of al-Hafiz; meaning that he is accepted in supporting narrations (mutaba'at). And this hadith is from a single route.

P13593 - Biographies of the narrators in another route for the hadith: (Whoever wears a garment of fame, Allah will clothe him on the Day of Resurrection)
The compiler, may Allah have mercy on him, said: [Musaddad narrated to us; he said: Abū ʿAwānah narrated to us; he said: “a garment of humiliation.”].
This is a third teacher for Abu Dawud in this hadith, and he is Musaddad ibn Musarhad, trustworthy (thiqah); al-Bukhari, Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi, and al-Nasa'i narrated from him.
[Abū ʿAwānah narrated to us].
He has already been mentioned in the first route.

P13594 - Explanation of the hadith: (Whoever imitates a people is one of them)
The compiler, may Allah have mercy on him, said: [ʿUthmān ibn Abī Shaybah narrated to us, Abū al-Naḍr narrated to us, ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ibn Thābit narrated to us, Ḥassān ibn ʿAṭiyyah narrated to us, from Abū Munīb al-Jurashī, from Ibn ʿUmar, may Allah be pleased with them both, that he said: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: “Whoever imitates a people is one of them.”]. 

Abu Dawud cited the hadith of Ibn ʿUmar, may Allah be pleased with them both, that the Prophet ﷺ said: “Whoever imitates a people is one of them.” This is censure of one who imitates the disbelievers, because outward imitation may lead to inclination inwardly and in the heart.

What is intended by that is imitation in something that is among their distinguishing characteristics and something that is among their hallmarks. As for matters that are sought in Islam—such as preparing strength and giving care to beneficial affairs—then this is something sought; but the prohibited and forbidden matter is what is in issues of clothing or appearance and the like.

His statement: “Whoever imitates a people is one of them” is severe censure regarding one who is like that.

He placed this hadith under the chapter of wearing the garment of fame, meaning that the compiler considers wearing the clothing of the disbelievers to be considered wearing the garment of fame; and this is possible. For if the people of his land wear a certain clothing among the clothing of the Muslims, and then he appears among them in other clothing—whether it is for disbelievers or for others—then that is a garment of fame: an outfit that brings together two evil matters. One of them is that it is the clothing of disbelievers. The other is that it is strange to people, and in it there is fame among people; thus he gathered between two calamities."""

Fixing placeholder truncations in translation
I noticed that I've left placeholder truncations like "h...", "hi...", and "th..." in the text. These were probably inserted by a tool, but now I need to replace them with the full text. For example, “So I called him…” should be completed properly. I'll do this for the other instances in the translation.

Fixing potential bracket duplication
I see that we've replaced the hadith bracket and could have accidentally created duplicate closures or removed a bracket incorrectly. We also might have inserted an extra closing bracket when patching. To fix this, I'll carefully check the segment around P13587 to ensure there aren’t any leftover or duplicated brackets.

P13586 - What has been narrated regarding the aqbiyah

P13587 - Explanation of the hadith: (The Messenger of Allah ﷺ distributed aqbiyah)
The compiler, may Allah have mercy on him, said: [Chapter: What has been narrated regarding the aqbiyah.
Qutaybah ibn Saʿīd and Yazīd ibn Khālid ibn Mawhab narrated to us—to the same meaning—that al-Layth (meaning: Ibn Saʿd) narrated to them, from ʿAbd Allāh ibn ʿUbayd Allāh ibn Abī Mulaykah, from al-Miswar ibn Makhramah, may Allah be pleased with them both, that he said: “The Messenger of Allah ﷺ distributed aqbiyah and did not give Makhramah anything. So Makhramah said: ‘O my son! Come, let us go to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ.’ So I went with him. He said: ‘Go in and call him for me.’ He said: So I called him. Then he came out to him while wearing one of those coats. He said: ‘I saved this for you.’ He said: So he looked at it—Ibn Mawhab added: Makhramah; then the two of them agreed—they said: Makhramah was pleased.” Qutaybah said: From Ibn Abī Mulaykah; he did not name him]. 

The aqbiyah are a garment said to be tight-fitting, from the clothing of the non-Arabs; and this is the qabā, with lengthening (madd) and without hamzah. Ibn Ḥajar said in
Checking bracket consistency and truncations
I see that the bracket at the end of the replacement looks good with "]." and the "From Ibn Abī Mulaykah" capitalization is okay, though it might be better to standardize and keep "from" as lowercase. I'll also ensure there are no unnecessary spaces or truncations like "u...d" in the final version. I'll check for consistency in brackets and spacing across the document.

Ensuring no Arabic characters except ﷺ
I need to double-check that no Arabic characters exist in the text except for the ﷺ symbol. It's important to maintain the consistency and follow the instructions correctly. If I find anything that doesn't match this requirement, I will remove it accordingly to stay on track.

Adjusting diacritics for non-name terms
I need to make sure no ALA-LC diacritics are used except for narrator names. While "Fath al-Bari" and “al-Hafiz” were adjusted correctly, "ʿAbadilah" should be changed to "the four Abdullahs" as it’s a group term, not a name. I’ll also confirm other terms like "Ibn ʿUmar" and "al-Miṣrī" are consistent.

Verifying diacritic use in terms
I’m checking for diacritic characters outside of names. We don’t have any issues with words like "isnad," but in "ʿAbadilah," the diacritic does appear. I’ll replace that. As for "maqrun," we’ve previously used "maqrūn," so I’ll need to confirm it's consistent. I'll list the macron and dot characters to double-check.

Finalizing diacritic checks and replacements
I’ve confirmed that "ḥ" only appears in names like "al-Raḥmān" or "Thābit," which is expected — no issues there. I’ll replace "ʿAbadilah" with "the four Abdullahs" to remove diacritics where needed. "Muḥammad" and "Sunan" are also fine as names. Now, everything should be in order.

Replacing diacritics in names and phrases
final5 = final4.replace("the four ʿAbadilah", "the four Abdullahs")
# verify no term

False
Finalizing checks for consistency and bracket issues
I’ve removed "ʿAbadilah" and confirmed it's not elsewhere. In P13592, "al-Hafiz" is used correctly since it's a title. Now I’m checking for any unnecessary three-dot sequences or extra brackets. Also, in P13587, there’s a duplicated bracket with content already included earlier. I’ll clean that up in the final output.

Verifying bracket consistency and punctuation
I noticed that within the hadith chain, I've included Abu Dawud's quote and added a comment inside the bracket, but later, in commentary, there's a repeated quote. I need to ensure that there aren’t any leftover extra bracket closures or punctuation issues. I’ll specifically check if any mismatched brackets or punctuation exist.

Ensuring proper bracket closure and repetition
I need to check that the hadith chain in P13587 starts and ends with a bracket, and verify there is no extra closing bracket left from the replacement made earlier. There might be multiple closing brackets in some places, so I’ll confirm only one closing bracket appears at the start and end of the relevant sections.

Verifying placeholders and translations
I need to make sure there are no leftover placeholders, like "H." Anything that was removed or replaced should no longer appear. The "H." in its own line is fine. I'll also double-check the P13587 hadith chain for completeness, confirming the translation uses "Go in" rather than "Enter," and that it's retaining the full context, especially the "So I called him."

Confirming translations and potential repetition
The translation for "فخرج إليه وعليه قباء منها" seems good, as we have: "Then he came out to him, and he was wearing a coat from them." Also, "خبأت هذا لك" is correctly translated as "I saved this for you," and "فنظر إليه" as "So he looked at it." I'll now check if the sentence in P13591 has an extra repetition after replacing the paragraph. Let's search for "And in it also" to confirm.

Verifying text integrity and bracket usage in narration
idx = final5.find("And in it also")

rn for that; he will be made to wear a garment of humiliation, so in it there is abasement for him. And in it also is his punishment by it, since in this narration it says: “Then the Fire will blaze in it.”

The garment of fame may be with intent, and it falls under the threat; and it may be without intent, and one fea
Finalizing the text formatting and clean-up
The tool’s slice output ends with "..." which is fine; it suggests that the sentence concluded there. Now, the last paragraph in P13594 is complete after the replacement. Checking the "The compiler, may Allah have mercy on him…" lines, everything looks good. No extra bracket issues in P13591 after reviewing the text. Before finalizing, I'll remove extra whitespace and ensure brackets correctly close with a single ‘]’.

Final validation and checks
I see that some bracketed parts have included brackets and periods like "[.]" while the original might have just been "]". User asked not to adjust the IDs. I confirmed the text doesn’t contain Arabic script except for ﷺ, following instructions. I'll also keep the diacritics for narrator names as required and use simple transliteration for technical terms. Everything seems good now!

Adjusting diacritic usage and names
We have "maqrūn" in the text, but it's not a name, so it should be changed to "maqrun" without diacritics. We are also careful with names like "al-Miṣrī", which should retain diacritics. I'll go through the text, ensuring non-name terms without diacritics are correctly adjusted, and names stay as they are.

Validating final text for diacritics and transliteration
final6 = final5.replace("maqrūn", "maqrun")
# check for remaining 'ū' chars
[u for u in set(final6) if u=="ū"], final6.find("ū")

(['ū'], 5466)
Checking for remaining diacritic "ū"
I found "ū" still in final6 at position 5466, meaning there may be more instances elsewhere. I’ll locate it and check other places where this diacritic might appear mistakenly, ensuring it’s corrected where needed. Time for a short scan of the rest of the text.

Locating character 'ū' in string
pos = final6.find("ū")
print(final6[pos-40:pos+40])

Correcting diacritics for non-names
It looks like we have "ū" in "Abū" which is fine since it's part of a name. However, terms like "qabā" (garment) should not have diacritics. The instruction specifies that non-names like this should be written without diacritics. I'll replace "qabā" with "qaba" and make similar changes for other non-name terms.

Finalizing diacritic adjustments
It seems "qaba" doesn't need the hamzah since "القبا" is written without it, just the alif and madd. I'll ensure "qabā" becomes "qaba" for non-names. "Miṣrī", "Naḍr", and "al-Raḥmān" are fine as names with diacritics. I’ll patch "qabā" to "qaba" and make consistent adjustments.

Checking non-name diacritics and adjusting letters
final7 = final6.replace("qabā", "qaba")
# find any remaining macron letters in non-name? Let's find 'ā' outside names maybe.
# We'll list all occurrences of 'ā' and show context to ensure it's in names.

(50, [278, 394, 411, 3537, 3554, 3788, 3880, 3910, 4276, 4293])
Checking for non-name occurrences of 'ā'
It looks like most of the 'ā' characters are indeed in names, such as "Khālid" or "Yazīd". I'll check for other potential cases like "maqbul" or "tawhid" to ensure there are no non-name uses. Also, "madd" seems fine, and “Day of Resurrection” doesn't appear to have 'ā'. I’ll keep looking for any edge cases.

Final checks for non-name diacritics and placeholders
I've removed 'ḥ' in instances like "Ḥassān," and double-checked for things like 'ṣ' and 'ʿ' in non-names, which seem fine. Now, I just need to confirm there are no lingering placeholders like "..." or incorrectly placed brackets. Quick search shows no such issues, so everything looks good for final validation!

Validating non-name diacritics and placeholders
"..." in final7, "].]" in final7, final7.count("["), final7.count("]")

(False, False, 24, 24)
Double-checking Arabic characters
I've confirmed that the brackets are balanced properly. Now, I'll do one final check to ensure that no Arabic characters other than ﷺ are present—though this was previously reviewed, it's always good to recheck after any adjustments. Let's make sure everything is consistent.

Checking for unwanted Arabic characters
arabic_ranges=[(0x0600,0x06FF),(0x0750,0x077F),(0x08A0,0x08FF),(0xFB50,0xFDFF),(0xFE70,0xFEFF)]

    o=ord(ch)
    if any(a<=o<=b for a,b in arabic_ranges):
        bad.add(ch)
    if '\u0660'<=ch<='\u0669' or '\u06F0'<=ch<='\u06F9':
        bad.add(ch)
len(bad)

0
Final check and adjustments for P13587
I’m verifying that P13587 ends with the correct bracket notation. We've adjusted where needed, but the explanation should clearly note the beginning of the "aqbiyah" sentence. Also, the commentary repetition is fine, and the translation inside the bracket aligns with the explanation following it. Everything seems set!

Final review and output preparation
I’ve double-checked the brackets, and the closing quote is intact before "Qutaybah said." There’s a note about addressing inconsistent curly quotes, but that’s not essential. Also, I confirmed ALA-LC transliteration is applied to the narrators, as required. Now, I should output everything as plain text and finalize the response.


Translating Qur'an verses and references
When translating Qur'an verses, I need to ensure that I omit Arabic characters but provide English translations. I should convert Arabic-Indic numerals (like ١٩٦) into Western digits (196), and I’ll preserve reference markers in English (e.g., "al-Baqarah: 196"). I should also consider tool outputs with HTML issues and Arabic digits.
Handling Arabic text and page markers
The "p=..." marker appears to be a page reference, which I can omit since it’s not an ID at the beginning of the segment. I should focus on translating the Arabic text, while avoiding Arabic punctuation like "؛" (Arabic semicolon). Additionally, I’ll use ALA-LC transliteration for narrators' names within isnad chains.
Translating and transliterating narrator names
For isnads and narrator biographies, I should use ALA-LC transliteration only on the names of narrators in the chain, including diacritics like ʿ, ā, ī, ū, etc. For example: "ʿAlī ibn Baḥr and ʿAbd Allāh ibn Saʿīd narrated to us..." The rest of the content does not need transliteration.
Transliteration consistency for narrators' names
The instruction specifies using ALA-LC transliteration for narrator names in the chain only, not for other text. However, if the name is part of a biography, it still refers to the same narrator. To stay consistent, I’ll apply the transliteration rule to narrator names in both isnaads and biographies.
Translating and transliterating names and terms
When translating or quoting hadith, I should avoid transliterating surah names like "al-Baqarah," as they aren't in the chain of narrators. For terms like Mina, Arafat, and al-Masjid al-Ḥarām, I will use conventional English forms without diacritics. However, I'll stick to ALA-LC transliteration only for narrator names.
Translating terms and ensuring accuracy
For terms like "Jamrat al-ʿAqabah," I’ll use common English approximations without diacritics, like "Jamrah of al-ʿAqabah." I’ll avoid unnecessary transliteration, but use terms like "jamrah" when discussing Hajj or fiqh. I'll stay consistent with using "Allah" for God, and "may Allah be pleased with her/him." No markdown, just plain text with standard formatting. I’ll ensure no Arabic numbers and avoid non-narrator transliteration like "ḥ" except for terms directly related to narrators.
Translating technical terms and diacritics
For terms like "ḥadīth," I'll stick to the standard English spelling "hadith," without diacritics, as it's now widely recognized. I'll do the same for other terms like "fiqh" and "ihram." For more technical terms like "thiqah" or "saduq," I'll translate as "trustworthy" or "reliable" and avoid including Arabic diacritics, unless it's part of the isnad.
Translating hadith chains and explanations
I’ll translate the hadith while retaining the full chain of narrators, using ALA-LC transliteration for Arabic names like ‘ʿAlī’, ‘Abd Allāh’, and ‘Muḥammad ibn Isḥāq’. Terms like "afāḍa" will be translated as “departed,” and I’ll include commentary with explanations for context. I'll ensure I preserve P6402 segments and provide file citations where needed.
Translating hadith chains and commentary
I will continue by translating the biographies of narrators and keeping their names transliterated, using terms like "thiqah" as "trustworthy." For hadith explanations, I will avoid Arabic terms like "Surah" and instead phrase things in a more straightforward way, keeping "Surat al-Baqarah" without diacritics, and ensuring proper transliteration throughout.
Translating and explaining hadith chains
To maintain accuracy, I’ll ensure all Arabic names and terms are properly transliterated, and translate key phrases like "wājib" as "obligation." I’ll respect fiqh terminology, like for “ihram,” and provide clear commentary. With each hadith chain, I’ll also include necessary clarifications for narrators and their connections.
Preparing translation and citation for narration chains
I will carefully translate and transliterate the hadith chains, ensuring I maintain the correct flow of the narrators. I need to preserve the original structure, avoid unnecessary Arabic punctuation, and use Latin characters with appropriate diacritics for names as per ALA-LC. Afterward, I will append the required file citation in plain text.

The user wants Arabic content translated into English, but with a twist: we need to preserve the full chains of narration and use ALA-LC transliteration only for the narrator names, not the content itself. So translators will use the system's diacritics, like Muḥammad for محمد and ʿUbayd for عبيد, for narrators' names.

Clarifying transliteration details for narration
For names in the chain of narration, I’ll use ALA-LC transliteration: Muʿammar for معمر, al-Zuhrī for الزهري, Hisham ibn ʿUrwa for هشام بن عروة, and ʿUrwa for عروة. ʿĀʾisha is the right transliteration for عائشة. I’ll also keep "صلى الله عليه وسلم" as ﷺ, and translate headings and verses. There should be no Arabic characters aside from that.

Translating technical terms and chains
For technical terms like hadith sciences, fiqh, and jarh wa ta'dil, I'll use literal translations like "narrator criticism." When translating chains, I'll follow the format "His statement: [Muḥammad ibn ʿUbayd narrated to us, Muḥammad ibn Thawr from Muʿammar from al-Zuhrī...]" and transliterate names. Non-name words like "حدثنا" will be translated as "narrated to us," maintaining exact brackets. Commentary like "ثقة..." translates to "He is reliable..." with "six canonical books."

Translating phrases and honorifics
For honorifics like "رحمه الله تعالى," I'll translate it as "may Allah have mercy on him" and "رضي الله عنها" as "may Allah be pleased with her," as per the user's request. I'll also keep IDs like P13881 intact and maintain parentheses and bracket structures. Additionally, I'll make sure to use "Allah" instead of "God" in translations.

Translating honorifics and words carefully
The user wants "صلى الله عليه وسلم" translated as ﷺ for the Prophet. For other honorifics, I'll use "may Allah be pleased with her" as per their instructions. I'll also maintain IDs, numeric prefixes, and preserve parentheses and brackets in the translation. I'll be cautious with transliteration following ALA-LC guidelines, using "ḥ" and "ā" with macrons for long vowels.

Translating names with care
I'll follow ALA-LC rendering for names, using appropriate diacritics, like "ʿĀʾisha" to clearly indicate hamza. For names such as "Yūnus ibn Yazīd al-Aylī," I'll retain the complete form. I’ll ensure consistency with transliterations for sequences like "Ibn Shihāb from ʿUrwa from ʿĀʾisha," while using proper long vowels and modifications as needed.

Translating names and applying ALA-LC rules
For names in chains like "Muḥmūd ibn Khālid" or "ʿUmar ibn ʿAbd al-Wāḥid," I'll follow ALA-LC transliteration. I'll keep names from non-narrative contexts, like "Anas" or "al-Albānī," in their standard English forms without diacritics. To stay consistent, I’ll focus ALA-LC strictly on the names within narration chains.

Translating names and terms according to instructions
I'll stick to the user's instruction: only transliterate names in chains using ALA-LC. So for "al-Albānī," I'll keep the standard translation as "al-Albani" with no extra transliteration. For terms like "الثقة," I'll translate them to "reliable," and for technical phrasing, I'll ensure the intended meaning is preserved, like translating "أخرج له أصحاب الكتب الستة" as "the authors of the six canonical books narrated him."

Translating Q&A and hadith commentary specifics
For the hadith, I'll translate "أورد أبو داود الحديث من طريق أخرى، وفيه زيادة أنه أخرجه إلى البيداء" as "Abū Dāwūd transmitted the hadith by another route, with the addition that he transmitted it 'to al-Bayḍā'."

For Q&A sections, I'll translate terms like "الأسئلة" to "Questions" and "سؤال" to "Question," and maintain correct transliteration for names in chains, allowing "al-Albānī" as acceptable.

Translating the term and following instructions
For Q13886b, I'll translate "الألباني صححه; لكن ما أدري هل له شواهد" as "Al-Albānī authenticated it; but I do not know whether it has supporting chains." Since Al-Albānī isn't in a chain, I'll leave it as "al-Albānī" with macrons; it's acceptable.

For the heading translation of "تراجم رجال إسناد حديث," I'll go with "Biographies of the narrators of the hadith ('There used to enter upon the Prophet's wives a man who was effeminate')," and use "effeminate man" or "a mukhannath," depending on context.

Translating hadith chains and terms carefully
I'll translate the paragraph starting with "قوله..." as: "His statement: [Muḥammad ibn ʿUbayd narrated to us; Muḥammad ibn Thawr from Muʿammar from al-Zuhrī; and Hishām ibn ʿUrwa from ʿUrwa from ʿĀʾisha]." This seems to clarify the chain clearly.

For the commentary, I'll use "reliable" for "الثقة," and translate "أخرج له أصحاب الكتب الستة" as "the authors of the six canonical books have transmitted him." Also, I need to ensure correct terms like "awli al-irba" as those possessing sexual desire.

Translating complex points and rulings carefully
For the translation of the elderly man with sexual desire, the phrasing should be: "If a man reaches the age of senility, then yes; otherwise, if he is fully conscious and of sound mind, he is not considered to be among those without sexual desire. He may still desire women or have experience with them."

For rulings on clothing and the abaya, the answers could be: "It is not appropriate for young girls to wear pants," and "The abaya should not be open in front, as it

I need to follow all the instructions: plain-text English translation, keeping IDs intact, and using ALA-LC transliteration on names (like Abdul Muhsin al-Abbad, who isn't in the text). I'll translate phrases like "الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم" as ﷺ, "God" as Allah, and preserve all instructions about style and terminology for accuracy. Also, I'll handle specific legal and technical terms like "hadith".

Thinking about specific Islamic terms and translations
For "صلاة الغائب", I'll translate it as "the absentee funeral prayer" or "funeral prayer for the absent," as that's the correct meaning in Islamic fiqh. Regarding "الدعاء صلاة," that'll be translated as "Supplication is ṣalāh," and I’ll keep "Allah" for God. For certain phrases, I’ll ensure literal translations, like "for a stake to be driven into the head..." when quoting hadith.

Thinking about hadith and translation nuances
The hadith about an iron spike being better than touching a woman unlawfully will be translated literally. The term "التبرك" can be translated as seeking blessings (tabarruk), and “هل يجوز التبرك بماء المطر” as “Is it permissible to seek blessings from rainwater?”. I'll carry on ensuring these nuances are captured, like the Prophet being touched by rain or not hanging clothes to deliberately get wet. Now for the "permission to enter for a blind person."

Translating hadith and phrases
For the hadith about an iron spike, I'll keep it literal: "It would be better for a man that an iron spike be driven into his head than touch a woman not lawful for him." For the phrase "التبرك" I'll translate it as "seeking blessings" or "tabarruk". Additionally, for other terms: the Prophet going out and rain touching him; and the rule about permission being related to sight for a blind person.

Interpreting hadith about blind person seeking permission
The hadith explains that a blind person still needs to seek permission three times before entering a house. Regarding family and the state of ihram, it discusses a person who is non-mahram (or a close relative in some interpretations) needing to seek permission to enter, especially if there is a woman present who is not lawful for them.

Interpreting blind individual's permission to enter and hadith on exposing head in rain
The hadith suggests that a blind man may enter a home where there is a non-mahram woman, but only if he is unaware of her presence. The permission is to ensure the woman can cover herself. Moving on, there’s a hadith in Sahih Muslim about exposing the head in rain, symbolizing a renewed covenant with God.

Lecturing guidelines, suitor's gaze, and family gatherings
When a man lectures women, there should be a partition to avoid any interaction, though a blind man might not need this since he doesn’t see them—he should just advise women not to look at him. As for suitors, they may only look at the face and hands of their intended, not the legs or hair. When brothers and wives sit together, avoid non-mahram interactions. Lastly, regarding the authentication of Nabhan, al-Dhahabi may have been more cautious in his evaluation.

Regulations for men lecturing, suitor’s gaze, and family gatherings
Men lecturing to women should use a partition, while a blind lecturer doesn’t need one but should advise women not to look at him. A suitor can look at the face and hands only. Family gatherings should include caution with non-mahram interactions. Regarding Nabhan's authentication, the term difference in terminology may be the reason for different preferences in judgment.

Clarifying transliteration guidelines for scholars' names
The instruction specifies ALA-LC transliteration should only apply to narrators in the hadith chains, not other textual content. However, names like al-Dhahabi, Ibn Hibban, and Ibn Hibban are scholars, not narrators in the chain, so transliterating these may not be required. "Thiqah" vs "wathaqa" distinctions should be preserved literally.

Clarifying transliteration and scholar names
The instruction specifies ALA-LC transliteration applies only to narrators in the chain. So, while Nabhān mawla Umm Salamah should be transliterated accordingly, scholars like al-Dhahabī and Ibn Ḥibbān, though important, aren’t narrators and don’t need transliteration. However, the user may still expect it for scholars, so it’s a bit ambiguous.

Considering appropriate translation approaches
I need to translate hadith quotes carefully and maintain their meaning. Key phrases like "صلاة النافلة" should be translated as "nafl prayer" (voluntary). "الستر" likely refers to a barrier for prayer, so I’ll use "sutrah (screen or barrier)," sticking to the literal translation for technical terms, except for narrators.

Deciding on term translations for clarity
For "سترة," I’ll go with "sutrah (screen/barrier)" to keep things clear. The guidelines advise using ALA-LC for narrators, so I’ll limit transliteration to names and stick with English for non-narrative terms. For "جورب," I’ll use "sock" or "stocking" and avoid transliterating "jawrab." "الذيل" refers to the trailing hem, and I’ll translate "إرخاء الثوب" as allowing the garment to trail.

Translating chapter headings and key terms
For the chapter heading "حكم اكتفاء المرأة بالجوارب عن إرخاء الثوب," I’ll go with "Ruling on a woman relying on socks instead of trailing her garment" for conciseness. I’ll also translate Q/A segments as "Question" and "Answer." For hadith quotes, "لا وصية لوارث" becomes "There is no bequest to an heir," and "أهوال القيامة" as "the terrors of the Day of Resurrection." I'll use "the first blowing (of the trumpet)" for "النفخة الأولى," and "the crushing blow (al-ṣa‘qah)" for "الصعقة."

Translating specific phrases and context
For "الصعقة," "the shock" works, but I'll include "the crushing blow" in parentheses for clarity. "يرخص للصغار ما لا يرخص للكبار" translates to "the young are permitted what

I need to carefully translate from Arabic to English while keeping the ALA-LC transliteration for narrators. Allah should be used for "God", and I'll keep ﷺ as is in Arabic. The key is to ensure only the narrator names, such as "Ibrāhīm ibn Mūsā", are transliterated, then revise the translation multiple times before sharing it.

Translating and transliterating narrator names
I need to transliterate narrator names in the chain, like "Ibrāhīm ibn Mūsā", using ALA-LC. The names in square brackets marking the chain components count as narrators, so they should be transliterated as well. Biographical info containing narrator names should also be transliterated. It’s mainly the names in the chain that need this.

Translating content with ALA-LC transliteration for narrators
The instruction is clear: I should transliterate only the names of narrators in the chains using ALA-LC, but not the rest of the text. For biographical lines or names like "Ibrāhīm ibn Mūsā al-Rāzī", those should be transliterated too. For other narrative content, like "رحمه الله تعالى," it'll be translated as "may Allah have mercy on him."

Translating specific terms carefully
I should translate "ذراع" as "arm's length" or "cubit" in most cases, considering the context. "شبر" could be translated simply as "a span." The user asked for literal translations but also mentioned that meaning can sometimes fit better. I'll avoid extensive transliteration, sticking to simple and accurate terms.

Translating and transliterating accurately
The user wants literal translations, so I'll use "a span" and "a cubit" in parentheses for clarity. For narrator names, I'll follow ALA-LC transliteration, including macrons and ʿayn (e.g., "ʿAbd Allāh" for عبد الله). For names like

I need to follow the specific transliteration rules: ALA-LC for narrator names, including diacritics like macrons and accent marks. I must preserve Arabic phrases like ﷺ and "Allah" exactly as they're written, without using Arabic characters elsewhere. Poetry and chapter headings must also be translated, but I’ll ensure to follow the precise formatting instructions. Three internal revision passes will handle any necessary tweaks.

Translating "قُباطي" and addressing transliteration issue
The term "قُباطي" refers to thin white garments from Egypt, and its plural form is "qubāṭī." However, I must follow the rule of only transliterating narrator names. In the case of this phrase, I’ll likely need to translate "لبس القباطي للنساء" as "Wearing the qubāṭī for women" without using transliteration in the rest of the text.

Clarifying transliteration and translation rules
I need to adhere closely to the instruction that only narrator names are transliterated using ALA-LC, while other Arabic words should be translated into English. For "القباطي," I’ll translate it as "thin white outergarments (qubāṭī)" with the original term in parentheses. No Arabic characters other than specific ones.

Translating hadith with proper format
When translating hadith, I’ll follow the instruction carefully: for the text like "أتِيَ رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم بقباطي فأعطاني منها قبطية," I’ll translate it as "The Messenger of Allah ﷺ was brought a qubāṭī and gave me one of them." I'll maintain the format for narrator names using ALA-LC style, like "Aḥmad ibn ʿAmr ibn al-Sarraḥ," ensuring proper diacritics. For "قال المصنف رحمه الله تعالى," I'll use, "The author, may Allah have mercy on him, said."

Translating and adapting names and honorifics
When transliterating names like "ابن وهب," I’ll follow ALA-LC and write it as "ʿAbd Allāh ibn Wahb,” ensuring I use diacritics where necessary. Honorifics like “raḍiya llāhu ʿanhu” will be translated as "may Allah be pleased with him." For the Prophet, I'll use ﷺ as instructed.

Translating hadith and author attribution
When translating the hadith, “تختمر به” should be translated

I’m considering the correct transliteration for the names. There’s a mix-up here between names like Zuhayr ibn Ḥarb and ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ibn Muḥammad. The “ح” abbreviation could refer to “ḥ” or even “ḥajr.” The ambiguity in the text suggests the full name is likely ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ibn Muḥammad ibn Mahdī, as noted earlier.

Finalizing transliteration for names
I’m trying to pinpoint the correct transliteration. ALA-LC would likely say "ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ibn Muḥammad ibn al-Mahdī," but the original says "عبد الرحمن بن مهدي." Should I stick with a precise "ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ibn al-Muhdī"? Hmm, to be accurate, I should use ALA-LC for narrator names specifically in the chains.

Reviewing names for transliteration accuracy
I’m going through the names in the chains to make sure they’re transliterated correctly. For example, "Zuhayr ibn Ḥarb" fits ALA-LC guidelines. For "ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ibn Mahdī," I’m debating whether it should be "ibn Muḥammad" or "ibn Mahdī." It seems like the full name should be "ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ibn Muḥammad ibn Mahdī."

Addressing narrator name transliterations
I'm reviewing names to ensure correctness. For "Zuhayr ibn Ḥarb," ALA-LC fits perfectly. For "عبد الرحمن بن مهدي," the transliteration might be "ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ibn Mahdī," but adding "Muḥammad" seems more accurate. Next, "مسدد بن مسرهد البصري" might be transliterated as "Masdād ibn Musarhad al-Baṣrī." But maybe simpler "Masdād" works better.

Reviewing additional names for transliteration accuracy
I'm double-checking the transliterations of names like "Masdad ibn Musarḥad al-Baṣrī," "Yaḥyā ibn Saʿīd al-Qaṭṭān," and "Sufyān ibn Saʿīd ibn Masrūq al-Thawrī." "Wahb mawla Abī Aḥmad" looks correct as is. Umm Salama should also be transliterated since it's a narrator’s name. I’ll stick to transforming just the names from the chains.

Translating technical terms and consistency in rules
I need to only transliterate proper names in chains. For terms like "istibra'" (استبراء), I’ll retain the transliteration with apostrophe. Here, I’ll translate "istibra'" as "attain purity by a menstruation" to match the Islamic technical context. Similarly, "ʿawrah" (عورة) can remain transliterated, while others like "awrah" could be translated.

Translating technical terms and context adjustments
So, I’m following the rule to not transliterate anything but names. For terms like "awrah," I’ll use the English equivalent while keeping the technical term in parentheses, like “awrah (what must be covered).” For chapter references, I’ll refer to "al-Mā’idah 5:6" in transliteration, and for “المغيا,” it will be translated as "the subject of covering."

Translating technical terms for clarity
The text is discussing the meaning of "ghaya" (limit) and "maghya" (included area). To make it clearer: "The intended meaning is that 'ghaya' is not part of 'maghya,' meaning whether the navel is included or excluded. There’s disagreement on whether the knee should be included." It's about where the limits in certain Islamic practices start and end.

Translating names and concepts carefully
It’s common that the ‘end’ or ‘limit’ (ghaya) is included in the ‘included area’ (maghiya), as with the elbows in the washing verse from al-Mā’idah. As for names like Ibn Taymiyya, it’s safe to use English transliterations for well-known scholars, though the instructions ask for ALA-LC transliteration only for narrators in chains.

Translating and transliterating carefully
The term ‘end’ (al-ghaya) is often included in the ‘included area’ (al-maghiya), like the elbows in ablution. When discussing scholarly names like Ibn Taymiyya, it's safe to transliterate English names for well-known scholars. However, sticking to ALA-LC transliteration is crucial for narrators in chains, but other names just need translation.

I need to translate the Arabic text carefully, specifically using ALA-LC transliteration only for names in the chains of narration, and keeping IDs at the start. I'll translate صلى الله عليه وسلم as ﷺ and "God" as Allah. I'll revise the translation three times to ensure accuracy, without formatting chapter headings in uppercase or using markdown, just plain text. All names need ALA-LC transliteration, using diacritics where applicable.

Clarifying transliteration of chains
I need to focus on transliterating only the names in the chain, not entire sentences. For example, "حدثنا محمد بن العلاء" should be "Muḥammad ibn al-ʿAlā narrated to us." I'll use ALA-LC rules, which include macrons over long vowels and special marks for certain letters. A name like "نبهان مولى أم سلمة" becomes "Nabāhān mawla Umm Salama." I need to be consistent with naming conventions.

Translating names in chains, considering narrators
I need to focus on transliterating only the names in the chain. "أم سلمة" is a narrator, so it should be transliterated as "Umm Salama." In this case, it’s part of the chain, so I’ll include it as a name. For translation, “حدثنا” becomes “So-and-so narrated to us.” I'll stick with ALA-LC for consistent naming.

Translating hadith chain content carefully
For the first segment, I’ll translate "[حدثنا محمد بن العلاء]" as "Muḥammad ibn al-ʿAlā narrated to us," ensuring names follow ALA-LC transliteration. The term "ثقة" translates as "reliable" (thiqa), and "أخرج له أصحاب الكتب الستة" should be "The compilers of the six canonical books have transmitted from him." I’ll use precise terms like "the six major collections" for clarity.

Translating names and narrators
For chain "[حدثنا ابن المبارك]," it becomes "Ibn al-Mubārak narrated to us. He is ʿAbd Allāh ibn al-Mubārak al-Marwazī, reliable; the compilers of the six books have transmitted from him."

For "[عن يونس]," it's "from Yūnus ibn Yazīd al-ʿAylī."

For "[عن الزهري]," it's "Muḥammad ibn Muslim ibn ʿUbayd Allāh ibn Shihāb al-Zuhrī," using al-Zuhrī in ALA-LC style.

Lastly, "[حدثني نبهان مولى أم سلمة]" translates to "Nabhān, the mawla of Umm Salama, narrated to me."

Translating fiqh ruling and contextualizing
The heading translates to: "Ruling on a woman's looking at a man for a need, or on television, a look free from suspicion." It’s important to use precise fiqh terms—"non-mahram man" works here instead of "stranger." "Without desire" and "for purposes of interaction" should be kept accurate. The sentence suggests that looking during transactions is not necessary, making it impermissible in this context.

Translating with fiqh terminology
In fiqh, "non-mahram" is the most accurate for "a strange/non-mahram man", avoiding "stranger". I’ll use "it is not appropriate" instead of "not permissible" to reflect nuance. For Aisha’s story, I can say, "viewing from afar differs from close-range looking". As for TV, “women can listen without looking.”

Translating hadith and ensuring consistency
The hadith "a woman should not look at men, even on TV, but she may listen without looking" is clear. For the hadith on looking at 'awrah, I’ll maintain full chains: "Muḥammad ibn ʿAbd Allāh ibn al-Mīmūn narrated from al-Walīd, who narrated from al-Awzāʿī..." I'll stick to ALA-LC transliteration for names within chains but leave the textual content unchanged.

Translating a hadith chain and explanation
For the hadith chain, I'll transliterate the names, not the Arabic words or content. So it would look like: "[Muḥammad ibn ʿAbd Allāh ibn al-Mīmūn narrated; al-Walīd from al-Awzāʿī, from ʿAmr ibn Shuʿayb, from his father, from his grandfather, may Allah be pleased with him, from the Prophet ﷺ, 'If one of you marries off his slave woman, do not look at her ʿawrāh.']"

For the explanation part, I'll carefully translate the rights connected to ownership and marital relations described.

Translating legal terms and explanation
When a man owns a slave woman, she is lawful for him for both service and sexual enjoyment. He owns her sexual access (baḍʿ) and her person and labor. If he marries her off, the benefit of intercourse (baḍʿ) transfers to the husband, but the ownership of service remains with the original owner.

Clarifying translation and rendering terms
I need to be precise with terms like "يملك بضعها" and "ويملك شخصها وعينها". I'll translate "baḍʿ" as "her sexual access" and avoid transliterating it. "عينها" can be translated as "her body" or "physical self," but I’ll use "her person and her physical self" for clarity. For narrators' names, I'll follow ALA-LC, transliterating with notes like "Muḥammad ibn ʿAbd Allāh ibn al-Mīmūn."

Translating hadith chain and commentary
I’m working on the translation for the hadith chain: "Zuhayr ibn Ḥarb, Wakiʿ, Dāwūd al-Muznī," and want to make sure I use proper transliteration like "al-Bukhārī" and "the authors of the Sunan." For the rest, I'll clarify the term "'Abdullah" as the "four righteous ʿAbdullāh's." For the commentary, I'll make sure to explain the details clearly, noting the proper boundaries of 'ʿawrah.'
I need to translate the provided Arabic text to English, while keeping the IDs intact. For the names of narrators in the chains, I should apply ALA-LC transliteration – like for Sheikh Abdul Muhsin al-Abbad. But for the text itself, no transliteration is needed, just for the narrators.

Following translation requirements and instructions
I shouldn’t transliterate general names, and instead, I must adhere to instructions like translating "God" as "Allah" and using ﷺ for Prophet salutations. Any Arabic characters like “عليه الصلاة والسلام” must be preserved, but only the ﷺ abbreviation is allowed. I'll ensure each chapter heading, like P13946, is translated, keeping IDs intact. I'll review the translation three times for quality. Lastly, I’ll check if ALA-LC transliteration for Sheikh names is necessary.

Clarifying translation rules for names and terms
For the non-narrator scholar names, I should probably translate them naturally, like "Sheikh Abdul Aziz ibn Baz," instead of applying ALA-LC, as ALA-LC is only needed for narrator names within chains. I'll also ensure "God" is translated as "Allah" and maintain key terms like "hadith sciences" and "fiqh." Each ID must be translated separately.

Translating technical terms accurately
I need to use accurate technical terms, like "menstruation" for حيض and "purification" for طهارة. For "طهرت," the most precise translation is "she became ritually pure," aligning with Islamic context. "اغتسلت" should be translated as "performed ghusl," since it's a technical fiqh term. I'll avoid extra formatting or unnecessary flourishes, sticking to plain text. I'll prioritize literal translations unless context demands a shift in meaning.

Translating terms and names according to instructions
The user prefers literal translations, so "طهرت من حيضها" translates best as "she became pure from her menstruation" or "her menses ceased." "Ritually pure" seems most accurate for طهارة. "اغتسلت" should be "performed ghusl." I'll keep terms like "ghusl" and "menses" in plain text. For "Sheikh" names, ALA-LC transliteration is okay for clarity.

Considering name transliteration preferences and rules
The user allows only the " ﷺ" Arabic characters, so I can't include other Arabic script or diacritics like the "ʿ" for ALA-LC. Given the rules, I'll avoid using diacritics and stick to conventional English spellings like "Sheikh Abdul Aziz bin Baz" for accuracy and compliance.

Translating names and hadith with accuracy
I’ll follow the user’s preference by transliterating scholar names like "Sheikh 'Abd al-'Aziz bin Baz" with standard ASCII apostrophes. For the hadith, I’ll translate it to: "as he ﷺ said: 'Do what the pilgrim does except do not circumambulate the House until you have become pure.'" I’ll maintain clarity in translating sections and preserves IDs and headings.

Translating with clarity and accuracy
I’ll translate the text carefully while preserving the meaning and context:

"How was she performing the prayer?! Purification for fasting is not an issue: if dawn came upon her after becoming pure and she fasted without performing ghusl until after dawn, her fast remains valid. Similarly, if a person experiences janāba before dawn and does not perform ghusl until after, the fast is valid. But now, the issue is the prayer: how was she praying? Or does she not pray at all? How could days pass without purification and prayer? And if she prayed, how was her prayer? A woman who does not pray—may Allah protect us from that—is in a more serious situation than fasting! Some may fast but neglect prayer. Prayer is more important than fasting."

Continuing with the next paragraph:

“If a woman is ignorant or has menstruation for the first time and is unaware, she may pray. However, when a woman experiences repeated menstruation without knowledge of prayer, it suggests that her life may have passed in this bad state of either neglecting prayer or praying without purification.”

Clarifying the translation of the passage
Translating carefully: "In sum, if she was ignorant or if this was her first menstruation and she had missed prayers, her prayer is still valid. However, fasting is valid even without ghusl after menstruation – the only issue is with the prayer not being valid without purification." Here, fasting is valid, but prayer without purification isn’t. The passage emphasizes that for someone unaware, her prayer is considered valid if it’s her first experience, but awareness is crucial for ongoing prayer practices.

Clarifying the translation with consistency
If she was ignorant or it was her first menstruation and she didn’t know, her prayer would be valid. Fasting, however, is valid without ghusl following menstruation—only prayer requires purification. There's a slight contradiction in wording earlier, but the core message ensures that the prayer situation depends on awareness.

Clarifying prayer validity based on ignorance
If she was unaware or it was her first menstruation, then her prayer is valid. However, if menstruation is recurring and she doesn’t know about prayer, it suggests many years have passed without proper prayer, possibly without purification. Fasting remains valid without ghusl, but prayer requires purification.

I need to translate Arabic into English following the guidelines. I'll preserve full chains and apply ALA-LC transliteration only to the names of narrators. This means I’ll use the correct macrons and diacritics, such as "Yazīd" for يزيد or "Muʿammar" for معمر. I'll avoid making textual content part of the transliteration.

Following translation guidelines for Arabic text
I need to ensure the translation follows specific guidelines: translate صلى الله عليه وسلم as ﷺ, use Allah for God, and avoid Arabic characters except ﷺ. Diacritics like ʿ are not part of Arabic script, so they are allowed in transliteration. I'll also revise the work three times for accuracy and consistency.

Translating technical Islamic terms accurately
For the term "الدباغ", it refers to "the tanning process" or "tanner." Since I need to translate technical Arabic terms into English, I should use "tanning" or "tanner" instead of transliterating as "dabbāgh", as the instruction suggests. Similarly, "الإهاب" means "raw hide" or "skin," so I’ll use "raw hide" for clarity.

Translating terms and handling transliteration
For "الإهاب," since the instruction is to avoid Arabic characters other than ﷺ, I’ll translate it as "raw hide" instead of using transliteration like "iḥāb." I’ll also follow the guideline to only transliterate narrator names, such as "Musaddad" for مسدد and "Yazīd" for يزيد using ALA-LC.

Translating names in chain of narrators
I should follow the instruction to transliterate Arabic names only in the isnad chains, like those inside brackets such as "Muḥammad ibn Yaḥyā ibn Fāris" or "ʿAbd al-Razzāq." For other parts, like author names or biographical entries, I shouldn't apply ALA-LC transliteration. Only names directly in the chain need it.

Transliterating narrator names and applying ALA-LC
For narrator names in brackets, like [قال أبو داود: لم يذكر الأوزاعي...], it seems safe to apply ALA-LC, even outside the chains. Names like Musaddad, Yazīd, and az-Zuhrī should be transliterated with macrons and ʿ, ensuring correct pronunciation. I'll ensure even names like "Muḥammad ibn Yaḥyā ibn Fāris" follow this approach.

Transliterating Arabic names accurately
For names like "عبد الرزاق" it becomes ʿAbd al-Razzāq. Then, names like "معمر بن راشد الأزدي البصري" get transliterated as Muʿammar ibn Rāshid al-Azdī al-Baṣrī. For "يزيد بن زريع", it's Yazīd ibn Zurayʿ. I'll apply ALA-LC transliteration accurately across all names, even if some have more complex translations.

I need to follow specific guidelines for transliterating Arabic names. For example, when translating text like "حدثنا عبد الله بن مسلمة", names should use ALA-LC transliteration, so 'ʿAbd Allāh ibn Maslamah'. I'll ensure I correctly apply macrons and the reversed apostrophe for ʿayn, and only use ALA-LC for narrator names.

Ensuring correct Arabic name transliteration
For transliteration, I'll convert Arabic names carefully using ALA-LC rules. So, I'll write 'ʿAbd Allāh ibn Maslamah', 'Mālik', and 'Yazīd ibn ʿAbd Allāh ibn Qusayt' (since 'Qusayṭ' looks correct). 'Muḥammad ibn ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ibn Thawbān' with ALA-LC diacritics, and I'll confirm the names like ʿĀʾishah are consistent. Only names receive transliteration, and I'll adjust the chapter headings.

Clarifying translation conventions
I have to ensure "God" is always translated as "Allah" and use ﷺ for any "صلى الله عليه وسلم" occurrences, maintaining the Islamic honorific. Also, I’ll make sure to preserve expressions like "narrated to us" as appropriate—such as 'Muḥammad narrated to us' for "حَدَّثَنَا مُحَمَّدُ", using ALA-LC transliteration only for names. No need to describe revision passes.

Translating technical terms and narrators
In translating, I need to ensure terms like "استمتع" are contextually accurate — here it means "benefit from" or "enjoy." For phrases like "أمر أن يستمتع," the translation should reflect permission, not just ordination: "ordered that it is permissible to benefit from the skins of carrion if they are tanned." I'll also use ALA-LC for hadith narrators and preserve notes like "رحمه الله تعالى" as "may Allah have mercy on him."

Translating hadith and names accurately
I’ll follow the instructions carefully to ensure proper ALA-LC transliteration, such as 'Mūsā ibn Ismāʿīl al-Tabuḏkī' and 'Qatādah ibn Duʿāmah al-Sadūsī al-Baṣrī', while using normal translation for the rest. For example, I’ll use "the wife of the Prophet ﷺ" for 'زوج النبي', and translate full sentences normally, like 'May Allah be pleased with her'. I need to keep precision!

Translating scholar names and commentary accurately
Since the rule is to transliterate only the narrators in the chain, I’ll keep "Abu Dawud" as is, treating it as regular text. For other names like "Abū Dāwūd," I’ll follow the instructions and not transliterate them unless they appear directly in the chain. I'll also ensure phrases like "رحمه الله تعالى" are translated properly.

Translating the narratives in P13966
For the phrases in P13966, I’ll ensure to transliterate names in the chains like "عبد الله بن مسلمة" and translate descriptions like 'ثقة' as "reliable/trustworthy." For "أخرج له أصحاب الكتب الستة إلا ابن ماجة," it'll be translated as "The authors of the six books except Ibn Mājah transmitted it," and ensure accurate handling of terms like "Al-Ṣidīqah bint al-Ṣiddīq" for ‘الصديقة بنت الصديق’.

Translating hadith and technical terms with care
The phrase 'الصديقة بنت الصديق' refers to the daughter of al-Ṣiddīq (Abū Bakr). "Tanning purifies it" is the translation of 'دباغها طهورها', in context with the hadith, directly translating: "Its tanning is its purification." For 'الألباني يضعف هذا الإسناد,' I'll translate as "al-Albānī weakens this isnād," since he's a scholar, not part of the chain. Similarly, I’ll ensure careful translation of additional hadith-related terms like 'القرظ'.

Translating technical terms and hadith with care
For 'دباغ

I need to translate the Arabic text into English, while preserving IDs. For names in chains of narration, I’ll use ALA-LC transliteration. For example, "أحمد بن صالح" becomes "Aḥmad ibn Ṣāliḥ." I'll translate "God" as Allah and "صلى الله عليه وسلم" as ﷺ. I must revise the translation three times, being cautious with technical terms.

Translating Islamic technical terms accurately
The user prefers literal translation unless context requires otherwise. I need to be careful with terms like "ثقة," translating it as "reliable," and "مقبول" as "acceptable." I should use ALA-LC transliteration only for names. For other technical terms, I’ll use precise English, but some might include Arabic in transliteration if not prohibited.

Translating technical terms and references
I’ll translate technical terms like "reliable," "accepted," "weak," and "mukhaḍram" into English. For "mukhaḍram," I'll say "a transmitter of the transitional generation." As for book names like "Bukhari" or "Abu Dawud," common transliterations like "al-Bukhārī" and "Abū Dāwūd" seem safer.

Translating technical terms and chapter headings
I’ll translate terms like "reliable," "accepted," and "weak" directly into English. For "mukhaḍram," I’ll use "a transmitter of the transitional generation" to stay clear, even if it's a little messy. I’ll also keep transliterations like "al-Bukhārī" for book names and use "Chapter" for "باب" headings.

Translating "إهاب الميتة" carefully
The term "إهاب الميتة" refers to the skin of a dead animal, and "eḥāb" is used for un-tanned skin. Given that the user requested to preserve technical terms while translating by meaning when possible, I'll use "eḥāb" transliterated as "ihāb" for clarity but avoid formatting, as plain text is requested.

Translating "إهاب" according to guidelines
Since the user requested ALA-LC for names of narrators, I’ll transliterate names like "Aḥmad ibn Ṣāliḥ" but translate "إهاب" as "raw hide" or "the skin of a dead animal." The explanation from Abu Dawud will be included, but I won’t use ALA-LC for non-narrator terms, following the user's rules.

Applying ALA-LC for narrator names
When transliterating names, I should follow ALA-LC conventions, using diacritics like macrons for long vowels, e.g., "Aḥmad ibn Ṣāliḥ" or "ʿAmr" for "عمرو". For names like "كثير بن فرقد," I'll use "Kathīr ibn Farqad." Even in explanatory notes, if they mention narrators like "al-ʿAjlī," I’ll transliterate these per ALA-LC.

Applying conventions for transliteration and translation
For transliteration, I'll follow ALA-LC guidelines for narrators' names, like "Kathīr" for "كثير" and "ʿAbd Allāh ibn Mālik ibn Ḥudhaffah" for "عبد الله بن مالك بن حذافة." "al-ʿĀliyah bint Sabiʿ" for "العالية بنت سبيع" and "Maimūnah" for "ميمونة." I'll also translate technical terms simply, like "the six books" and "the two Sahihs."

Finalizing transliteration and translation rules
For the transliteration, I'll use ALA-LC for all narrators' names, like "Kathīr" for "كثير" and "ʿAbd Allāh ibn Mālik ibn Ḥudhaffah." I'll apply it only to names of narrators in the chain as per the user’s request. For technical terms, simplified translations like "the six books" and "the two Sahihs" are better.

Crafting the translation with ALA-LC and consistency
I’ll follow the order for translation while keeping the ALA-LC transliterations for names. For consistency, I'll use "Maymūnah" for "ميمونة" despite multiple transliteration possibilities. Also, I’ll keep "Umm al-Muʾminīn" for Maimūnah’s title, while preserving other transliterations and diacritics where needed.

Translating with ALA-LC and adjusting names and terms
I'll translate the hadith body carefully, ensuring I use the correct transliterations like "ʿAṣab" for 'عصب' (likely meaning tendon or sinew), and "ihāb" for 'إهاب' (raw hide). For names, I’ll stick to ALA-LC rules, like using "ʿAbd Allāh ibn Wahb" and "Kathīr ibn Farqad" consistently. I'll refine terms, translating "shan" as "old qirbah" or "suqā" as needed.

I need to translate Arabic into English while following specific guidelines. For narrators’ names in chains, I will use ALA-LC transliteration, like "Hanad ibn al-Sari" for هناد بن السري and "Abu al-Mu'tamir" for أبي المعتمر. But for "God," I’ll use "Allah." I'll use the correct diacritics, like ḥ for ح and ʿ for ع.

Translating names in hadith segments using ALA-LC
In this hadith segment, the names to transliterate include "Hanād." The name هناد should be transliterated as "Hanād" with a regular "h" since the Arabic letter هـ represents "h," not "ḥ." For "السري," I’ll be using "al-Sarrī." I should confirm the focus is on the chain and the ALA-LC guidelines for names.

Translating using ALA-LC rules for names
For the name هناد بن السري, based on ALA-LC transliteration rules, I’ll use "Hanād ibn al-Sarrī." It's important to be accurate with macrons for ā, ī, and ū, and diacritics for ḥ and ʿayn. Although "al-Sari" is more common in some classical transliterations, I will use "al-Sarrī" here for consistency with ALA-LC.

Translating names in hadith with ALA-LC
For names like "وكيع بن الجراح," I'll go with "Wakīʿ ibn al-Jarrāḥ" and add "al-Rūʾāsī al-Kūfī" for clarity based on later full mentions. For "Muʿāwiya," it'll be "Muʿāwiya ibn Abī Sufyān," and "Muḥammad ibn Bashshār" will stay as "Muḥammad ibn Bashshār (nicknamed Bundār)." I’ll follow ALA-LC transliteration rules for all, with caution on special names.

Translating narrators' names with ALA-LC
In the chain "حدثنا أبو داود," the transmitter is "Abū Dāwūd," full name "Sulaymān ibn Dāwūd al-Ṭayālisī." I’ll follow ALA-LC rules, ensuring to only transliterate narrator names and not general Arabic words. I'll also preserve narrations and keep translations for phrases like "may Allah have mercy on him" for "رحمه الله تعالى."

Translating the hadith with careful attention
For the chain, I will transliterate just the names: "Hanād ibn al-Sarrī narrated to us from Wakīʿ from Abū al-Muʿtamir from Ibn Sīrīn from Muʿāwiya (may Allah be pleased with him)". For terms like "khazz" (silk) and "nimār" (tiger skins), I’ll translate them based on context, aiming for clarity but sticking to literal translation when possible. It'll require thoughtful revisions for accuracy and presentation.

Translating the section for clarity
In the provided segment, I’ll translate as: "The use of skins of nimār (tigers) and sabaʿ (wildcats) is forbidden by Islamic law due to extravagance, arrogance, and their use by non-Muslims. These skins, whether from slaughtered or naturally dead animals, remain impure." I'll further clarify the term "مذَكَّاها", likely referring to the slaughter process. I'll revise several times for precision in meaning.

Translating and refining the explanation
The passage seems to suggest that skins from animals that died naturally, not through proper slaughter, hold the same impurity as their carcasses. I'll translate this as: "Additionally, these skins from dead animals (not lawfully slaughtered) are treated like their carcasses."

For the rest, I'll continue translating the hadith and headings according to the text guidelines, ensuring I follow the instructed format.

Refining hadith translation and names
The angels refraining from accompanying those with tiger skins seems to be a key point. For the heading, "Skins of tigers and wild beasts" feels like a suitable translation.

For the hadith explanation, I’ll translate the narration accurately and transliterate the names of narrators like "Hanād ibn al-Sarrī", "Wakīʿ", "Abū al-Muʿtamir", etc., while excluding Arabic characters in the narrative.

Clarifying transliteration and commentary
It seems the names within the chain of transmission need to be transliterated, such as "Abū Saʿīd" and "Abū Dāwūd," while other names like “Yazīd ibn Tahmān” should follow ALA-LC rules. I'll focus on this for the names mentioned in the narration, while leaving other textual content untouched. The commentary will cover definitions and reasons for prohibition.

Translating and interpreting narrators and commentary
To be safe, I’ll transliterate only the names of narrators in the chain, like "Abū Saʿīd" and "Yazīd ibn Tahmān." Other names, like "Hanād ibn al-Sarrī," will follow ALA-LC rules too. The commentary should explain the prohibition, clarify the praise for Muʿāwiya's truthfulness, and address the variant readings of Ibn Sīrīn’s words.

Translating narrators and explanations
When translating, I'll use "trustworthy" for "ثقة" and phrase the citation of narrators accurately. For ʿ

I need to make sure I follow the instructions for ALA-LC transliteration, especially for names in chains. For example, transliterating عمرو بن عثمان بن سعيد الحمصي as 'ʿAmr ibn ʿUthmān ibn Saʿīd al-Ḥimṣī.' Meanwhile, the text demands no diacritics for certain names like Muḥammad. Explanatory text with names doesn't need to follow this rule.

Translating Arabic with clarity and care
I need to translate Arabic into English, keeping chains intact and making sure I use specific terms: 'Allah' for God and translating ﷺ as 'Prophet'. I'll preserve names in ALA-LC transliteration like 'radiyallāhu ʿanhu' but translate phrases like رضي الله عنه to 'may Allah be pleased with him'. I'll be careful with hadith/science terms, focusing on accuracy and clarity.

Translating and transliterating names and content
I need to translate chapter headings, poetry, and verses while using ALA-LC transliteration for names. For instance, "عمرو بن عثمان بن سعيد الحمصي" should be rendered as "ʿAmr ibn ʿUthmān ibn Saʿīd al-Ḥimṣī". ALA-LC uses macrons for long vowels, like 'Uthmān'. Some names, like 'Baqiyyah' or 'Baqīyah', require careful transliteration too. I'll be careful with the details!

Applying ALA-LC transliteration accurately
I need to transliterate names with ALA-LC rules, like "عمرو بن عثمان بن سعيد الحمصي" into "ʿAmr ibn ʿUthmān ibn Saʿīd al-Ḥimṣī". ALA-LC uses macrons for long vowels, so "Uthmān" and "Baqīyah" are correct; but some uncertainty exists with names like "Buhayr" or "Bahir," so I’ll need to be precise and mindful with those common names.

Translating names in the chain correctly
I need to transliterate names in the narrator chains consistently. For example, "عمرو بن عثمان بن سعيد الحمصي" becomes "ʿAmr ibn ʿUthmān ibn Saʿīd al-Ḥimṣī." As for "بقية," it could be "Baqīyah" or "Baqiyyah," depending on the context, but ALA-LC prefers "Baqiyyah." I'll ensure consistency in transliteration throughout the chain.

Translating narrators in the chain consistently
For the names in this chain, I'll use ALA-LC rules for transliteration. For example, "Baqiyyah ibn al-Walīd," "Buhayr ibn Saʿd," "Khālid ibn Maʿdān," and "ʿAmr ibn ʿUthmān." For names with long vowels like "Khālid," I'll apply the correct diacritic, and I will make sure to transliterate only the narrators, including companions where needed.

Translating narrators carefully
I’ll transliterate headers like "Khālid ibn Miʿdān" and "Musaddad ibn Masruhid" as closely as possible, even if some uncertainty remains. The user expects accuracy, so I’ll use "Yaḥyā ibn Saʿīd" and "Ismāʿīl ibn Ibrāhīm" accurately. For terms like ‘رجع’, I’ll use the transliteration “istirjaʿ” while avoiding Arabic text except for

I need to make sure I follow the ALA-LC guidelines for transliterating Arabic names, using macrons and special characters such as ʿ for "ayn" and ʾ for "hamza." For example, "Masaddad" should be "Masaddad ibn Masruhd al-Baṣrī" with macrons on long vowels. I wonder if "Musaddad" is also a common transliteration?

Handling names and hadith translation carefully
I need to be careful with transliterating names, especially when they appear in hadith chains. "Masaddad" seems appropriate for "مسدد بن مسرهد" even though "Musaddad ibn Musarhad" could be another option. For clarity, I'll apply consistent transliteration only for narrators in the chain and include the full context for the translation. I'll also preserve the hadith structure.

Translating religious terms and phrases
For phrases like "subhanahu wa ta'ala," I'll go with "exalted is He" or "Glory be to Him" as suggested. I’ll use "Allah, Glorified and Exalted" for context, especially when "سبحانه وتعالى" appears. Regarding "الشرع الحنيف," I’ll use “the upright law (Sharīʿah)” or simply "the noble Sharīʿah." I'll keep terms like "ḥadith sciences" and "fiqh" as they are, focusing on translating the content.

Translating terms and clarifying formatting choices
For "الأهب," I'll translate it as "ahab, plural of ihāb, meaning skin," without any transliteration or formatting. Following the earlier instructions, I’ll only transliterate narrators in the chain and translate other terms into English. It’s important to stick to this approach for consistency in formatting.

Translating hadith and handling narrators' names
For the translation, I'll use "ahab, plural of ihāb, meaning hide/skin" and avoid transliteration for general terms. In the hadith chain, I need to preserve the narrators' names with ALA-LC transliteration: Masaddad, Wahb ibn Bayān, ʿUthmān ibn Abī Shaybah, and Ibn Abī Khalaf. I’ll update the text while maintaining the chain structure.

Handling proper names and hadith translation
For the hadith, I’ll preserve the standard transliteration for names like Sufyān, al-Zuhrī, and Ibn ʿAbbās. The hadith text should be translated clearly. I’ll use "carrion" for "ميتة" (a dead animal), "tanned" for "دبغتم," "its hide" for "إهابها," and "benefited from it" for "استنفعتم به." The final phrase becomes "Only its eating is prohibited."

Translating hadith commentary and technical terms
I'll translate commentary paragraphs carefully while keeping the citation format in mind. For verses like "حُرِّمَتْ عَلَيْكُمُ الْمَيْتَةُ," I'll use "{Forbidden to you is carrion} [al-Mā'idah: 3]". Regarding technical terms, I'll use the common translation for "dhikāh" ("ritual slaughter (dhikāh)") and transliterate narrator names like Masaddad, Wahb ibn Bayān, and others accurately.

Translating biographical notes and maintaining consistency
For biographical notes, I'll translate "رضي الله عنهما" as "may Allah be pleased with them" for two persons and "may Allah be pleased with him/her" for singular. For names of scholars like "Masaddad ibn Masruhd al-Baṣrī," I'll transliterate them according to ALA-LC. For book names, I'll keep the English transliteration without diacritics to maintain consistency.

Considering transliteration and referencing in Arabic text translation
The user's instruction is clear: I must transliterate narrators' names using ALA-LC in the chain (e.g., "Muḥammad ibn Yaḥyā ibn Fāris"), but not the actual textual content. For commentary, I think I should use common English name forms without diacritics, but only if they’re not in the chain.

Deciding on transliteration, diacritics, and translation rules
For the text, ALA-LC would apply only to names in the chain with diacritics (e.g., Abū Hurayrah). In the commentary, I'll use conventional forms (e.g., Abu Hurayrah, Ibn Umar) without diacritics. Also, no Arabic is allowed except for ﷺ. I'll translate Qur'anic verses and reference numbers into English and Western digits.

Finalizing transliteration and translation rules
For the reference, let's go with "al-An'am (6:153)" without diacritics. We’ll use English without punctuation changes, so no need for the apostrophe in "al-Anam." The translations inside square brackets will also stay, but we’ll ensure everything in the chain is properly translated (e.g., "ḥaddathanā" to "narrated to us").

Translating narration phrasing and applying ALA-LC
For translations, I’ll use "narrated to us" for "ḥaddathanā," "from" for "عن," and "he said" for "قال." The phrase "قال أبو داود: حدثت عن ابن وهب" becomes "Abu Dawud said: It was narrated to me from Ibn Wahb." Narrator names in the chain, like Abū Dāwūd and Ibn Wahb, will have ALA-LC with diacritics.

Applying ALA-LC and translation for narrators and text
For ALA-LC, I’ll use "ʿUbayd Allāh ibn Mūsā" or "Abū Ṣāliḥ" for names and ensure diacritics are employed for correct transliteration (e.g., Yaḥyā and Fāris). "The Prophet ﷺ" will be used with "and his family" translated separately when needed. No Arabic script will be included, so I’ll translate verses like "فما شئت كان..." into English.

 '\nP14482 - شرح حديث (ويل للعرب من شر قد اقترب)\nقال المصنف رحمه الله تعالى: [حدثنا محمد بن يحيى بن فارس حدثنا عبيد الله بن موسى عن شيبان عن الأعمش عن أبي صالح عن أبي هريرة عن النبي صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم قال: (ويل للعرب من شر قد اقترب، أفلح من كف يده)].\nأورد أبو داود حديث أبي هريرة قال: (ويل للعرب من شر قد اقترب، أفلح من كف يده)، ومحل الشاهد هنا: (أفلح من كف يده) يعني: في القتال بغير حق، ويمكن أن يكون أيضاً في الفتن التي تحصل، وذكر العرب لأنهم معظم المسلمين في أول الأمر، والإسلام إنما كان أولاًً ',
 '(وإنما أخشى على أمتي الأئمة المضلين)؛ لأنهم يحرفونهم ويصرفونهم عن الحق والهدى بأن يضلوهم ويخرجوهم من الجادة والاستقامة إلى الطرق المنحرفة الخارجة عن الصراط المستقيم، كما قال الله عز وجل: {وَأَنَّ هَذَا صِرَاطِي مُسْتَقِيمًا فَاتَّبِعُوهُ وَلا تَتَّبِعُوا السُّبُلَ فَتَفَرَّقَ بِكُمْ عَنْ سَبِيلِهِ} [الأنعام: ١٥٣].\nقوله: [(وإذا وضع السيف في أمتي لم يرفع عنها إلى يوم القيامة)]، يعني: إذا حصلت الفتن، وبدأ قتل الناس بعضهم لبعض وإهلاك الناس بعضهم لبعض فإن هذا سيبقى، ولكن ليس لأحد أن يأتي من خارج الم\n')
Handling incomplete text and citation format
The file ends right after "من خارج الم", indicating an incomplete thought. I'll translate this as "...but it is not for anyone to come from outside the..." while noting the ellipsis to convey this. As for citations, since the user prefers plain text, I'll include the citation at the end as required.

Translating segment IDs and handling notation
I'll translate the text segment by segment, keeping the ID like "P14482 -" for each. The headings will also be translated but with the ID retained. Arabic words, such as names like "البخاري", will be translated without diacritics, and I’ll translate technical terms like "thiqa" as required—letting me convey the meaning while following the user’s instruction on formatting.

Choosing accurate technical terminology and translations
For terms like "صدوق," using "truthful" or "acceptable" makes sense, rather than transliterating as "ṣadūq." While such terms are part of the content, not narrator names, accurate English equivalent terms like "truthful," "trustworthy," and "reliable" should work best. I'll also translate terms like "أصحاب الكتب الستة" as "the compilers of the Six Books."

Translating hadith and naming conventions
For hadith translation, I’ll keep the wording clear: "Successful is the one who restrains his hand" instead of the Arabic “أفلح من كف يده”. I'll translate parenthesized Arabic like "Woe to the Arabs..." into English for clarity. For names, I’ll stick with "Suhaib al-Rumi," "Salman al-Farisi," and "Bilal al-Habashi" without diacritics, following the instruction to use transliteration only for narrator names in the chain.

Translating and maintaining formatting
I'll translate the content into clear English while preserving the numeric segments like P14482, following each ID line’s structure. For transliteration, I’ll use ALA-LC standards for Arabic names (such as ʿ for ‘ayn and ʼ for hamza). I won’t transliterate text in the hadith itself—only narrator names and terms when necessary.

Confirming transliteration for ALA-LC
I'll follow ALA-LC rules, using correct symbols like "ʻ" for ʿayn and "ʼ" for hamza. For example, "ʻUbayd Allāh" for ʿUbayd Allāh. Diacritics will only be included for narrator names, not textual content. I'll give names like "Sulaymān ibn Ḥarb" accurate transliterations with diacritics, but other names will avoid diacritics unless necessary.

Translating and formatting Qur'anic and hadith excerpts
I'll make sure to translate the bracketed Qur'anic verses, keeping the curly braces as indicated. For the lines like "فما شئت كان وإن لم أشأ," I'll break it into two plain-text lines, ensuring the meaning is clear. For hadith, I'll include references and translate phrases like "رحمه الله تعالى" as "may Allah Most High have mercy on him," as requested. I'll ensure all segment markers are preserved.

Translating without formatting and maintaining consistency
I'll ensure that I follow the user's request to avoid markdown and stick to plain text. Each segment heading will retain its ID, like "P14482 - Commentary on the hadith," and the rest of the segment will be translated right after the dash. For place names like "Silaḥ," I’ll use transliteration without violating the format. I'll also ensure Arabic numerals are converted.

Translating chain names and biographical details
For P14483, I'll translate "Biographies of the narrators" from Arabic, following ALA-LC guidelines for the chain names. For "Muhammad ibn Yahya ibn Faris," they mention al-Dhuhlī in the biography, but since it's not in the chain, I’ll keep it unaccented as per translation instructions. Also, bracketed chain names will be transliterated with diacritics.

Translating bracketed chain names and commentary terms
For bracketed phrases like [حدثنا عبيد الله بن موسى], I'll use diacritics while transliterating the names. Descriptive text, however, won't have them. For example, names in biographies or chain segments like "Abū Dāwūd" and "Muḥammad" will get treated differently. In textual content, like "O Muhammad!," I'll keep it as is. I'll also adjust the translation of specific terms accurately, like interpreting "الفتن" as "tribulations" and "السنة" as "drought," as needed.

Final translation of hadith and narrators' biography
For translating "رضي الله عنه", I'll use “may Allah be pleased with him.” For similar phrases like "رضي الله عنه وأرضاه", the translation will be "may Allah be pleased with him and make him pleased." When transliterating names in chains, I'll use diacritics (e.g., "Shaybān ibn ʻAbd al-Raḥmān") but avoid them in explanatory text. For terms like "الفتن", I’ll translate "tribulations" and adjust phrases like "ab'ād masalih" to "farthest outpost" according to context.

Translating Hadith Commentary and Biographies
For the commentary, I'll translate phrases like "Faith retreats to al-Madinah," emphasizing its symbolic strength and refuge from tribulations. I'll avoid using diacritics outside bracketed chains, such as for names like "Ibn Wahb" and "Abd Allah". I'll also clarify terms like “discontinuity” in breaks within the chain. The historical depth of narrators also requires careful handling, such as “al-Zuhri’s statement” where I’ll follow the same translation rules.

Handling translation with technical terms
I need to translate "تراجم رجال" as "Biographies of the men of the chain of narration" or "Narrators' biographies," using the technical term "isnād" for clarity. The term is Islamic, so while the user requested limiting transliteration to names, I’ll use "chain of narration" instead of transliterating. As for terms like "jarḥ wa-taʿdīl," I’ll stick to English equivalents like "trustworthy" (thiqah) to avoid Arabic. I'll be cautious about whether transliteration is acceptable for other technical terms.

Translating Islamic technical terms accurately
The user requested Islamic technical terminology, so I’ll use English equivalents like “trustworthy” for "ثقة" (thiqah) and “truthful” for "صدوق" (ṣadūq). I’ll avoid adding transliteration, unless they refer to names. For terms like "أخرج له البخاري تعليقاً," I’ll explain that al-Bukhārī narrated from him in a suspended form. I'll also remain careful, translating terms precisely.

Translating narrators and technical terms
The users specified scholars’ names, so I’ll use recognized forms like "al-Bukhārī" and "Ibn Mājah" (following ALA-LC standards). For hadith matn, I’ll translate literally, including quotes like "(if he becomes intoxicated, flog him…)". For terms like "دية," I’ll use “blood money" and avoid "ḥadd," using "prescribed punishments" instead.

Processing fiqh terms and translations
In fiqh, "ḥadd" is standard but I must refrain from transliterating it due to the user’s restriction. I’ll use “prescribed legal punishment” instead. Terms like "تعزيراً" are fine translated as "discretionary punishment". I’ll ensure all names follow diacritical and ALA-LC transliteration rules, like "Mūsā" and "Ḥammād". I'll keep translations clear, without Arabic letters. I'll also include translation details alongside the chain narration.

Managing transliteration of names
For various Arabic names, I’ll follow ALA-LC transliteration. For example: "Naṣr ibn ʿĀṣim al-Anṭākī" and "Yazīd ibn Hārūn al-Wāsiṭī." I'll stick with this system to ensure consistency, even with names like "ʿAbd Allāh ibn ʿAmr" and "Muʿāwiyah" while making sure they are clear and accurate.

Working with terminology and consistency
In translating, expressions like "في الرحال" become “among the baggage” and "يلتمس رحل خالد" should be “searching among the baggage for the saddle of Khālid ibn al-Walīd." For consistency, I’ll use ﷺ for the Prophet Muhammad in all relevant cases and avoid "peace be upon him." Also, I'll handle transliteration of names like “Ibn al-Sarḥ.”

Translating and formatting the text
In the commentary on P15340, I need to translate key phrases while mentioning the weak addition from Rashdayn, which scholars agreed upon. I'll ensure no Arabic characters — just transliterations, using Latin script and avoid Arabic numerals. For narrator names like Ibn ʿUyaynah or al-Bajlī, I'll use ALA-LC standards. For titles like "al-Adab al-Mufrad," I’m leaning toward transliterating as it’s a book title.

Translating book titles and terms
When translating "al-Adab al-Mufrad," I’ll stick to clear English: "The Book of Manners (al-Adab al-Mufrad)." I’ll avoid transliterating titles since instructions allow it only for narrators’ names. For book types like “Sunan” or “Ṣaḥīḥ,” I’ll use the standard English terms, with diacritics where applicable.

Applying ALA-LC Transliteration Guidelines Strictly
To follow the user's guidelines, I'll apply ALA-LC with diacritics for narrator names within bracketed isnad chains. For other names in explanatory text, I'll simplify by omitting diacritics, using common Latin forms. This ensures accuracy for narration while maintaining readability in the commentary text.

Finalizing Translation Approach
To follow the guidelines, I'll avoid using diacritics outside the chain, using basic transliterations like "Musa ibn Isma'il" or "Ibn Uyaynah." For 'ayn, I'll use an apostrophe ("Umar"). In the chain segments, I'll incorporate ALA-LC with diacritics. I'll also translate manually and ensure correctness with "The compiler" for المصنف and "may Allah have mercy on him" for رحمه الله تعالى.

Finalizing translation and citation details
I’ll need to translate each segment and keep it in plain text as requested. While citations are typically embedded with line ranges, the instructions seem to ask for just a simple citation like "(website)." I’ll mark the end with this format, as it's acceptable despite expectations for line ranges, ensuring I stick to the guidelines.

Understanding citation requirements and options
The instructions say to include "(website)" for citation, which I’ll do, but it may not fully comply with standard citation rules, which require line ranges. I could use a method to get line markers, but since the user asked for no markdown, I’ll stick with the simpler "(website)" format.

Considering citation placement and requirements
I have the chunks with line numbers and citation markers like "(website)". Since the user requested plain text without markdown, I’ll avoid formatting. Citations may be placed at the end of each segment, or grouped at the end. I’ll include them sparingly to meet requirements without overwhelming the response.

Reading documents
Reading documents

Deciding on citation placement
I have line-range citations for the file, but the tool’s instructions require using turn2file0 or turn2file1. The user didn’t request citations, so I’ll keep them minimal, placing one at the end of the translation (e.g., "(website)"). This avoids clutter while still satisfying system requirements and preserving readability.

Handling translation details and integrity
I’ll avoid putting citations inside parentheses, though it's fine in the filecite. For the translation, I need to handle specific terms carefully, like "مراتب الدين..." and maintain the numbering (e.g., P16028). I'll preserve the original punctuation and phrasing as required, ensuring clarity in terms like "qadar" and hadith quotes where necessary.

Handling technical terms and translations
For "qadar," I will use it with the explanation "divine decree" in parentheses the first time for clarity. The context around "القول بالقدر" will be translated as "the doctrine of qadar," noting the reference to the Qadariyyah. I'll keep literal translations and avoid Arabic except for ﷺ as requested.

Handling literal translations and clarifications
For "and that the matter is initiated anew," I'll translate it as "and that the matter is newly originated," with a possible clarification in parentheses. "يتقفرون العلم" will be "they delve into knowledge" or "pursue knowledge diligently." "أكتنفته" will be translated as "I and my companion surrounded him." I'll keep the translation of "لو أن لأحدهم مثل أحد ذهباً" as "if one of them had gold equal to Mount Uhud." "ما قبله الله منه" will be "Allah would not accept it from him."

Translating and clarifying terms clearly
I'll translate "أن تلد الأمة ربتها" as "that the slave woman gives birth to her mistress" and "رعاء الشاء" as "shepherds of sheep." "الحفاة العراة العالة" will be "barefoot, naked, destitute," and "يتطاولون في البنيان" will be "vie with one another in building tall buildings."

I’ll translate "muwazanat" as "balancing merits and demerits" without the Arabic term, and "al-tamthil" as "dramatization" or "acting," clarifying it involves lying. I’ll also translate the hadith about Muawiyah and Abu Jahm, complete with ﷺ.

For Jibril’s description, I’ll translate as "a huge created being filling the horizon with 600 wings." Lastly, "وَرَضِيتُ لَكُمُ الإِسْلامَ دِينًا" will be "and I am pleased with Islam as the religion for you" from Surah al-Ma'idah.

Translating key terms and proper names
I’ll translate “إِنَّ الدِّينَ عِنْدَ اللَّهِ الإِسْلامُ” as “Indeed the religion with Allah is Islam” (Surah Al 'Imran 19) while avoiding diacritics in surah names. “عز وجل” will be translated as “Allah, Mighty and Majestic” or “Most High.” “رحمه الله تعالى” translates as “may Allah, Most High, have mercy on him.”

For narrators, I’ll use ALA-LC transliteration, like “ʿUbayd Allāh ibn Muʿādh,” but for Prophet Muhammad, no diacritics are needed since he’s part of the content. “المصنف” refers to the compiler, likely Abu Dawud in this case.

Ensuring no Arabic characters and final translation details
I’ll maintain consistency by keeping IDs and numeric prefixes (e.g., 528) using Western numerals, converting Arabic numerals (٥٢٨ to 528). Arabic characters or curly brackets will be avoided. In translations, "رضي الله تعالى عنه وأرضاه" will be translated into English, maintaining respect without Arabic. I'll also avoid diacritic-like Latin letters (ʿ, ḥ) where unnecessary. Now, I’ll focus on creating clean content segments for clarity and accurate translation of references and text.

Clarifying the role of scholars and the concept of deviation
The people of knowledge are referred to when religious matters arise, especially when there are deviations or corruption in practices. In the hadith about Jibril, the response is that some individuals weren't completely deviant—though they held some good qualities, their innovation led to corruption in their practices.

Examples from the Prophet ﷺ about marriage and teaching
When a woman consulted the Prophet ﷺ about two suitors, he explained their conditions rather than their religious roles. He focused on what mattered—Muawiyah’s poverty and Abu Jahm’s behavior. This shows prioritizing relevant traits in decision-making. Similarly, mentions of names and addressing fathers show permissible practices in specific contexts.

Explanation of acting and the hadith on religion's ranks
Lying for amusement, such as in acting, contradicts reality and isn't allowed. In explaining the hadith of Jibril, three ranks in religion are outlined: Islam, iman, and the highest, ihsan. Ihsan involves sensing Allah's presence and majesty, which none can fully attain except whom Allah honors.

Explaining hadith on qadar, prayer, and terminology choices
The hadith of Jibril emphasizes belief in qadar (divine preordainment), essential for the acceptance of good deeds. Words like "ilah" represent a deity, so "there is no ilah but Allah" will be used. In translating "الشهادتين", "the two testimonies of faith" fits best, clarified if needed, avoiding Arabic. Similarly, "wali" can be translated to "a close ally of Allah."

Handling translation considerations for names and terminology
When translating terms like "الإيمان" and "الإسلام," we’ll ensure distinction between them, as they hold different meanings. I’ll use proper titles like "names and attributes" for "وأسمائه وصفاته" and "lordship" for "الربوبية". For consistency, we'll also stick to ALA-LC when transliterating narrators' names in the chain but avoid applying it to non-chain names.

Final considerations for translation accuracy
For the name "ʿAbd Allāh ibn ʿUmar," we'll stick with ALA-LC transliteration, ensuring proper diacritics are included. The same goes for other narrators like "ʿUmar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb." However, for the Prophet's name, we won't use ALA-LC in the matn, only in the isnad. I'll keep translations direct and without extra disclaimers.
