I need to make sure I follow the ALA-LC transliteration guidelines for narration chains only. For narrator names like "معاوية بن الحكم السلمي", it becomes "Muʿāwiya ibn al-Ḥakam al-Sulamī". Diacritics matter here — for example, using 'ʿ' for ʿayn. Confirm: I’ll transliterate narrators’ names, but leave the rest of the text intact.

Translating narrators' names within narration chains
I need to follow the instructions to transliterate only the names of narrators in the chain. So, "Abū Wāqid al-Laythī" and "Ibn ʿUmar" are correct for those narrators. For "Muḥammad narrated to us" and other phrases, I’ll leave the text intact except for the narrator names, including "Muʿāwiya ibn al-Ḥakam al-Sulamī".

Translating narrator and scholar names
I’m thinking through how to handle names. "Ibn Abī Shayba" and "al-Marwazī" should be transliterated since they’re part of the chain. But "السيوطي" might just be a scholar, not part of the chain, so maybe I won’t transliterate that. I need to focus only on narrators and companions, but I’ll play it safe and transliterate all names to avoid ambiguity.

Clarifying transliteration rules
I’ll transliterate only the names of companions and hadith transmitters like "Muʿāwiya ibn al-Ḥakam al-Sulamī" and "Ibn ʿUmar", but I’ll leave titles like "رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم" as "ﷺ" and "الله" as "Allah". Any Arabic phrases in Qur'anic verses should be translated. The IDs will stay at the start of segments, and I’ll pass over the text three times for revisions.

Handling translations and formatting
I need to keep numeric markers at the start of segments, like P2, P2a, and be sure to go through three revisions internally. The headings should not be in all caps. I'll translate segments while preserving reference numbers and ensure Qur'anic verses have a literal translation. Technical terms like "aqeedah" will be translated to "creed" when needed, and "علو الله" to something like "the highness of Allah".

Translating and transliterating narration details
For "ʿulū" I’ll go with "the highness of Allah", staying literal but clear. When the text uses "السماء", I’ll default to "in the heavens," which is conventional in tafsir. For transliteration, I’ll use the ALA-LC standard for narrators' names, such as "Muʿāwiya ibn al-Ḥakam al-Sulamī". Regarding Zaynab, she’s a companion and narrator, so I’ll transliterate her name consistently. In terms of "رضي الله عنه", I will translate it as "may Allah be pleased with him/her".

Translating hadith with accuracy and context
The instructions specify using ﷺ when صلى الله عليه وسلم is mentioned and translating "رضي الله عنه" as "may Allah be pleased with him/her". For this specific hadith, I’ll translate it as: "It is a prophetic question, reported by Muslim in his Sahīh from the hadith of Muʿāwiya ibn al-Ḥakam al-Sulamī, may Allah be pleased with him." I'll also ensure the Arabic is accurately translated, including the details about the slave-girl tending sheep.

Alright, I need to transliterate the names of narrators based on ALA-LC rules. In the given hadith, the narrators in the chain are Ibn ʿUmar, al-Bukhārī, and Muslim. I'll make sure to use macrons for proper transliteration, like "Ibn ʿUmar" and "al-Bukhārī." Narrators are key, but the textual content remains in plain text.

Transliterating narrator names per instructions
Based on the instructions, I need to transliterate only narrator names in the chain using ALA-LC standards, but this part is about attribution to Ibn Ṭāhir al-Maqdisī and Imam Abu Isma'il Abdullah ibn Muhammad al-Ansari. These are narrators' names, so I will transliterate them into ALA-LC format: Ibn Ṭāhir al-Maqdisī al-Ḥāfiẓ and Imam Abu Isma'il Abdullah ibn Muhammad al-Ansari.

Transliterating narrators and following formatting rules
To be extra careful, I'll transliterate the names of narrators such as al-Bukhārī, Muslim, Ibn ʿUmar, Ibn Ṭāhir al-Maqdisī al-Ḥāfiẓ, Imam Abu Isma'il Abdullah ibn Muhammad al-Ansari, as per the rules. I'll also translate "النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم" as ﷺ and "الله" as "Allah." I'll make sure not to include other Arabic characters and maintain correct formatting.

Translating verses and following instructions
I need to translate Quranic verses, keeping references like [الحشر 14] intact, and use a standard translation in English. For example, al-Hashr 14 translates to: "Their enmity is severe among themselves; you would think they are united, but their hearts are dispersed." I'll be careful with transliterating names, using ALA-LC rules like Ibn ʿUmar (with the modifier letter). Clear and precise translation is key.

Translating Quranic verses with clarity
For the verse in al-Hashr 14, I’ll translate it as: "Their hostility is fierce among themselves; you would think them united, but their hearts are divided." This keeps it literal but accessible. For 4:83, the translation would be: "When they receive news of security or fear, they spread it. If they had referred it to the Messenger or authorities, those who understand would have known." Keeping these translations simple and faithful works best!

Translating with clarity and accuracy
For Verse 4:59, I'll use: "O you who have believed, obey Allah, the Messenger, and those in authority. If you disagree over anything, refer it to Allah and the Messenger if you believe in Allah and the Last Day. This is better and more suitable for final determination."

The hadith will be: "All of you are shepherds, responsible for your flock...". I'll include the proper transliteration for narrators, like al-Bukhārī and Ibn ʿUmar. I'll make sure to use ﷺ after "the Prophet" and keep terms like 'innovation' or 'bidʿah' as they should be.

I need to make sure I'm translating Arabic segments accurately, preserving IDs and transliterations for named narrators only, such as أبو داود, أبو هريرة, and others, using ALA-LC for their names. I should make sure to keep the textual content untranslated, just focusing on the narrators' names.

Transliteration of narrator names and respecting character limitations
I need to use ALA-LC system for transliterating narrators' names, like Abū Dāwūd and Abū Hurayrah. For example, Ibn Mas'ūd should use the appropriate ʿ (as in Ibn Masʻūd), noting the Arabic character ﷺ is the only one specifically required. I’ll use ALA-LC standards while respecting character restrictions.

Clarifying transliteration procedure for narrators and scholars
The key instruction is to transliterate only the names of narrators in the chain. So, Abū Dāwūd and Abū Hurayrah are transliterated, but I don't need to transliterate textual content. As for the Prophet, it's customary to refer to them as رسول الله or النبي without transliteration. Scholars’ names should follow the same rule.

Transliteration of narrators, scholars, and Prophet
The instruction is clear: transliterate only narrator names in the chain, not phrases. So, "the Prophet ﷺ said" should be translated, not transliterated. For names like ابن مسعود, علي, and others, the names of narrators and compilers like Ahmad and Abū Dāwūd should be transliterated. But The Prophet ﷺ itself is left untouched.

Transliteration choices for narrators and compilers
I’ve got to follow the rule: transliterate only the names of narrators in the chain, not other content. Narrators like al-Tirmidhī, Ibn Mājah, Abū Dāwūd, etc., should be transliterated, but the authors or compilers like Imām Aḥmad remain untransliterated unless they appear as narrators. I’ll stick to standard ALA-LC transliteration.

Guidelines for careful translation process
I need to ensure proper translation of words like "God" to "Allah" and use the Arabic ﷺ for the Prophet, avoiding other Arabic characters. I should adhere to Islamic terminology like "sunnah," "hadith," "mutawatir," etc., and translate terms like "الحدث الأكبر" accurately as "major ritual impurity." I’ll also review and polish the translation three times.

Clarifying translation of controversial saying
So, "بال قائماً" might refer to a debated issue among companions—whether the Prophet ﷺ urinated standing. Some reports suggest that this was possible. I might translate: "denied that the Prophet ﷺ urinated standing." The rest of the translation also needs careful attention, like "المتعة" for temporary marriage and "أكل الضب" for eating a spiny-tailed lizard.

Interpreting "بال قائماً" and translation choices
The phrase "بال قائماً" seems uncertain—likely referring to the Prophet ﷺ urinating while standing, a subject of some historical debate. I’ll translate it as "denied that the Prophet ﷺ urinated standing." For the rest, I'll stick to the literal: "eating al-bard doesn

The user wants to translate Arabic to English but with specific guidelines. I need to preserve IDs, keep everything as plain text, and avoid markdown. For names of narrators in the chains, I should apply ALA-LC transliteration, such as Abū Hurayrah and Ibn ʿUmar, while leaving the rest of the text and content unchanged.

Translating only relevant names in the hadith chain
In the Arabic text provided, names like al-Bukhārī, Muslim, Abū Hurayrah, Ibn ʿUmar, and al-Albānī are mentioned. Since the user’s instruction specifies applying ALA-LC transliteration only to the narrators in the chain, I should transliterate the names of al-Bukhārī, Muslim, Abū Hurayrah, and Ibn ʿUmar, but not al-Albānī since he’s an authenticator outside the chain.

Translating only narrators’ names in the chain
Abū Hurayrah and Ibn ʿUmar are companions who might also be narrators, so I’ll transliterate their names. al-Bukhārī, Muslim, and Abū Dāwūd are compilers, not narrators, but they're part of the chain—so I’ll transliterate their names too. al-Albānī, though, isn't in the chain, so I won’t transliterate that.

Translating only relevant names in the narration chain
The user wants ALA-LC transliteration for narrators only. From the text, I’ll transliterate Abū Hurayrah, Ibn ʿUmar, and Abū Dāwūd (as they are narrators or referenced as such). al-Bukhārī and Muslim are collectors, not narrators, so I won't transliterate their names. The mention of "شيخنا محمد بن صالح العثيمين" isn't within the chain, so I won't transliterate that either.

Clarifying transliteration and formatting rules
The user’s guidelines are extensive: I need to translate "God" as Allah unless referring to another ilāh. I must also include ﷺ whenever it appears, and no other Arabic characters should be used. Names like Abū Hurayrah and Ibn ʿUmar should follow ALA-LC transliteration. Also, all names should be checked for diacritics and macrons, such as in al-Bukhārī and al-Albānī. Three revision passes are required for accuracy.

Translating and applying ALA-LC guidelines
The user wants ALA-LC transliteration only for narrators in the chain, so I should focus on Ibn ʿUmar, Abū Hurayrah, al-Bukhārī, Muslim, Abū Dāwūd, and al-Albānī. I’ll translate content literally, using "Allah" for God, and "ﷺ" for the Prophet. I should also use established English terms for technical concepts like "aqīdah" and "manhaj," but I won’t introduce Arabic script except for ﷺ.

Translating terms and applying guidelines
For consistency, I'll stick with "aqeedah" — as the user explicitly used it. The user wants no Arabic characters except ﷺ, so I'll transliterate terms like "Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jama'ah" appropriately. For Quranic verses, I'll provide literal translations with citations (like 6:121, 2:275), and include ﷺ after mentioning the Prophet. Additionally, for companions: "may Allah be pleased with them."

Translating and following instructions carefully
The user asked to translate "God" as Allah, and "may Allah be pleased with them" for companions, so I'll apply that consistently. For narrator names, I'll use ALA-LC, like "Ibn ʿUmar," including the ʿayn and macrons. For non-chain names, I'll leave them untranslated. I'll draft the translation carefully, checking for accuracy.

Translating properly and with care
I’ll use "Ibn ʿUmar," "Abū Hurayrah," and other narrators' names in ALA-LC style, only for the key narrators as instructed. "Muhammad bin Salih Al-'Uthaymeen" won’t be transliterated since it isn’t part of the chain. I’ll start the translation with the P7b paragraph and ensure numbering and phrasing accuracy for each point, as requested.

Clarifying transliteration and translation decisions
For the translation, I’ll use "Abu Bakr," "Umar ibn al-Khattab," and "Uthman ibn Affan" without diacritics as this instruction only applies to narrators, like "Ibn ʿUmar." I'll ensure to add "may Allah be pleased with them" (رضي الله عنهم) for the companions and translate "يصلحه ويظهره ..." as mentioned.

Deciding transliteration for companions and citation
For Abu Bakr, Umar, and Uthman, I'll leave them in standard English transliteration without diacritics since they are companions, not narrators in the chain. I'll also transliterate Ibn ʿUmar and al-Bukhārī as they are narrators in the hadith. I'll translate "may Allah be pleased with them" and include the correct citation for al-Bukhārī

I need to apply ALA-LC transliteration to narrator names in chains. For example, names like ثابت الضحاك should become Thābit al-Ḍaḥḥāk (this includes diacritics). I’ll keep the textual content as it is, only adjusting names like Anas, Abu Dawud, and Ahmad with their proper transliterations.

Translating names of narrators and cited figures
The instruction says to transliterate only the names of narrators in the chain, not other cited figures like Ibn Abbas or Mujahid. So I’ll focus on properly transliterating those in the chain, such as ثابت الضحاك and أنس, but I might need to hesitate on translating figures like Ibn Abbas, since they’re cited, not in a chain.

Translating narrators and other names
The instruction specifies to use ALA-LC transliteration for all names of narrators in the chain, so I’ll go with names like Thābit al-Ḍaḥḥāk, Anas, Abū Dāwūd, and others, keeping diacritics consistent. For non-chain names like Ibn Abbās and others, I’ll transliterate if they’re key figures. I’ll also keep verse translations consistent with the guidelines.

Handling translations and preservation of context
I need to translate phrases like "By the ten nights" literally but context-sensitively, maintaining a professional tone. For the honorific "رضي الله عنه," the translation should be "may Allah be pleased with him" rather than transliteration. I'll ensure numeric markers are intact and perform multiple accuracy checks during translation.

Handling honorific translation and citation accuracy
For the honorific "رضي الله عنه," I'll use "may Allah be pleased with him," as it's the standard. For the Prophet, I'll stick with ﷺ. I'll transliterate names like Ibn ʿAbbās using ALA-LC with the ʿayn. I'll preserve IDs like P9 as in the original Arabic, translating hadith content while avoiding Arabic script. Also, I'll ensure "Allah" is used for God and translate Quranic verses, keeping numeric references intact.

Translating Arabic terms and maintaining clarity
For the phrase “لا عيد إلا عيدي الفطر و الأضحى,” I’ll translate it as "There is no Eid except my two Eids, al-Fitr and al-Aḍḥā," as it preserves clarity and the essence of the original. I'll keep “Eid,” “al-Fitr,” and “al-Aḍḥā” in their common transliteration forms, with diacritics,

I need to ensure the chapter headings and verses are tightly translated, sticking to literal terms. For Islamic terminology like aqeedah, manhaj, and bid’ah, I should preserve these terms when necessary for clarity. But I also want to provide understandable English — using terms like "innovations" for bid'ah, "the call to Allah" for دعوة — while balancing accuracy and readability.

Finalizing translation approach
It seems that I should use "the caller (da‘ī)" with the term in parentheses, but avoid Arabic script aside from "ﷺ". The user specified preserving the full narration chains with ALA-LC transliteration only for narrators' names. I’ll stick with English translations for general terms while keeping the tone formal and avoiding extra Arabic characters. I’ll also follow the revision requirement.

Finalizing text translation
For the phrase "الحمد لله وحده..." I will go with "Praise be to Allah alone, and blessings and peace upon the one after whom there is no prophet; thereafter:" but might also consider "As for what follows:" or "then" if appropriate. I’ll translate Quranic verses inline with Arabic words in parentheses and maintain citation brackets for the chapters.

Finalizing translation of "رسوله صلى الله عليه وسلم" phrase
For the phrase "قد بعث رسوله صلى الله عليه وسلم على فترة من الرسل", I'll go with: "Allah, exalted, sent His Messenger ﷺ in an interval between messengers at a time when people were..." to keep the translation neat and clear.

I’ll also proceed by translating the pages P11, P11a, P11b, and P12 as instructed, maintaining accuracy.

Refining translation choices for Surah terms
For phrases like "Allah, exalted, sent His Messenger ﷺ in an interval between messengers...", it's important to stay literal, aiming for clarity and flow. For Surah translations, I’ll use standard ones like “O you who are wrapped up (1)” for المدثر, and “Allah the Exalted” for الله تعالى. Now, I’ll proceed with the translations for the paragraphs.

Translation considerations for phrasing and expressions
I'll translate "Allah, exalted" but vary it with "Allah Almighty" sometimes for variety. When translating phrases like "فاستعان النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم بالله تبارك وتعالى", I'll use "the Prophet ﷺ sought help from Allah, blessed and exalted

I need to follow specific instructions for a translation of Islamic content. This includes using ALA-LC transliteration for narrators' names, using Allah for "God," and ensuring correct use of ﷺ for salutations. The translation should be literal where possible, maintaining Islamic technical terms like aqeedah.

Ensuring accuracy in translation and format
I need to revise the translation three times for accuracy, including Quranic verses and poetry, and maintain the labeling like "P12c." I'll use literal translations for Quranic quotes within brackets and ensure proper ALA-LC transliteration for narrators' names only. I'll also preserve chapter headings and IDs.

Clarifying transliteration for names outside hadith chains
I'm determining how to handle names like "عبد العزيز بن باز." The guide says ALA-LC only for narrators in the chain, not for textual content. For names not in chains, I'll likely translate them into standard English. So, I should likely use "Sheikh ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz ibn Bāz" for consistency.

Clarifying transliteration for non-chain names
Since the instruction restricts ALA-LC to chain narrators, for names like "Sheikh ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz ibn Bāz" outside a chain, I should use the English rendering. Also, when referring to the Prophet, I must include ﷺ after mentioning him, in line with instructions, even though ALA-LC applies only to chain narrators.

Translating Quranic verses with precision
For the phrase "الحمد لله أولا وآخرا," the most literal translation seems to be "All praise is due to Allah first and last." Regarding Quranic verses, such as the one from Al-Haqqah, I must translate them exactly, like "And if he had fabricated against Us some sayings..." following standard Saheeh translation.

Translating with Islamic terminology and precision
For the verse from Az-Zumar, I’ll use the standard translation: "If you were to associate [others with Allah], your work would surely be lost, and you would surely be among the losers." I’ll also stick to the user’s preferences for ensuring terms like "fuqahā" and using 'Allah' and ' ﷺ' appropriately. The translation should be accurate using specific Islamic technical terms like 'aqīdah' and 'manhaj’.

Translating with consistency in Islamic terminology
I should use the terms "aqeedah," "manhaj," "hadith sciences," and "jarh wa ta'dil" exactly as the user wrote them. For transliterating Sheikh's name, I’ll opt for "Sheikh ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz ibn Bāz" with ALA-LC diacritics. I'll also ensure to include ﷺ after mentioning the Prophet, following the user's instructions.

Ensuring consistency in transliteration and translation
I’ll use "Sheikh ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz ibn Bāz" as the transliteration of Sheikh’s name for clarity while staying consistent with the instructions. I’ll also include ﷺ after every mention of the Prophet, as requested. For "Muḥammad," I’ll use diacritics, keeping the translation literal and maintaining the original IDs.

Translating with clarity and consistency
For this section, I'll translate "الداعي" as "the caller" but also use "(dā‘ī)" in parentheses for clarity. This stays true to the user's request for simplicity, though without deviating from the literal translation. I'll stick with "the caller" to maintain consistency and accuracy in meaning.

Choosing terms for clarity and consistency
For "الداعي", I'll stick with "the caller (dā‘ī)" to ensure it’s clear and simple, while following the user's likely preference for plain text. For "الدعاة والمتصدرين", I'll use "preachers and those in leadership positions," which feels the clearest. I’ll keep "non-Muslims" over "disbelievers" for neutrality and use "da’wah" to maintain consistency.

Finalizing translation choices for P13
I’ll use “da’wah” as the user requested no Arabic characters,

Okay, I need to follow the translation instructions carefully. I should use ALA-LC transliteration only for the names of narrators in chains. So, for Muhammad bin Saleh al-Uthaymin, I’ll transliterate that. For other names outside the chains of narration, I shouldn't translate them. Also, I'll make sure to translate "God" as Allah, and respect symbolic usage like ﷺ when needed.

Translating scholar’s name with ALA-LC guidelines
Okay, I should transliterate only the names of narrators in chains using ALA-LC. For a scholar like "محمد بن صالح العثيمين", I can transliterate this since it's part of the instructions. For other mentions, I should likely translate normally, though for consistency, I’ll stick with transliteration for safety.

Translating and transliterating with consistency
I should transliterate the scholar's name using ALA-LC: "Muḥammad ibn Ṣāliḥ al-ʿUthaymīn," and include "may Allah have mercy on him" for "رحمه الله." I'll also use "Allah" instead of "God" and " ﷺ" for Prophet Muhammad. For honorifics like "عليه السلام," I’ll translate it as "peace be upon him" for consistency.

Translating and formatting Quranic verses
I need to translate Quranic verses into English while preserving the original format. I'll keep surah names and verse numbers, but transliteration is necessary since Arabic characters (other than ﷺ) aren't allowed. So for surahs like آل عمران, I'll render as [Al ʿImrān] to maintain the required consistency.

Translating with transliteration and consistency
Okay, transliteration is safe for proper names—I'll stick with ALA-LC for scholars, companions, and prophet names like Ibrāhīm, Mūsā, and ʿIsā, since the guidelines didn't restrict that. For phrases like "عليه السلام," I'll translate as "peace be upon him" to keep things consistent. I’ll also go step-by-step, translating each segment clearly.

Breaking down the translation nuances
I need to be careful with phrases like "ثقافة وليس عندهم علم" meaning "they have culture but no knowledge" and "لا رواية ولا دراية" for "neither transmission nor mastery." For "المفكر الإسلامي," I'll quote as "Islamic thinker" with sarcasm. I'll also ensure my translation for terms like "صاحب كتاب 'الظلال'" (author of Fi Zilal al-Qur'an) stays faithful.

Translating complex terms and names
I must translate carefully. For example, "وحتى كاتبه قال: في ظلال القرآن، ولم يقل تفسير القرآن" becomes: "Even its author called it 'Fi Zilal al-Qur'an' (In the Shade of the Qur'an) and did not call it 'Tafsir al-Qur'an'." For names, like "الشيخنا محمد بن صالح العثيمين رحمه الله", I'll use ALA-LC transliteration. I'll also make sure to translate culturally significant phrases like "لا إله إلا الله" as "There is no god but Allah."

Translating Qur'anic verses and explanation
The verses from Surah Al ʿImrān (3:65-67) speak against claims that Prophet Ibrahim was Jewish or Christian. The translation reads: "O People of the Book, why do you argue concerning Ibrāhīm, when the Torah and the Gospel were not revealed until after him? Do you not understand?" The author then comments on the misguidance of those making such claims.

Clarifying Ash'arites and Qur'anic citation
The phrase "أمة قد خلت" means "a nation that has passed away," referring to ancient times. The author quotes Surah Al-Kahf (18:5) with a translation: "Such is the word that comes out of their mouths, they speak nothing but lies." He draws a parallel, arguing that the Ash'arites follow Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'arī, similar to Jews and Christians claiming Ibrahim followed Musa or ʿIsā. The reference to a Hadith from Sahih al-Bukhari is also shared, emphasizing the idea of following others' traditions.

I need to follow user instructions carefully: When translating Arabic, I should preserve the chains of narration and transliterate only the names in ALA-LC, not the textual content. For instance, "أبي هريرة رضي الله عنه" should become "Abū Hurayrah" with the correct macrons. I'll keep all narrators' names consistent with ALA-LC rules.

Clarifying translation requirements
For this task, I need to follow specific details: Use ALA-LC transliteration with diacritics like Ḥ for ح, and translate صلى الله عليه وسلم as ﷺ. For "God," I'll use Allah unless the text refers to ilāh. If there’s a Quranic verse, I should include it in parentheses with the surah and verse number. I'll also ensure multiple revisions of the translation before finalizing.

Clarifying translation and transliteration rules
The user wants poetry and verses translated into English. I should only provide ALA-LC transliteration for narrators' names in the chain, like Abū Hurayrah. However, titles like "رسول الله" shouldn’t be transliterated. Non-narrators’ names within the text, like "أبا حنيفة", should simply be translated, not transliterated.

Clarifying transliteration for non-narrator names
The user’s instruction is clear: I should apply ALA-LC transliteration only to names in the chain of narration. For other names, I will stick to common English transliterations, like "Abu Hanifa" or "Maliki". I shouldn’t apply ALA-LC rules to non-narrator names, just regular translation.

Handling transliteration and terminology
The user prefers ALA-LC transliteration only for narrators in the chain, so proper names like "Abu Hanifa" and "Malik" should follow conventional English forms without diacritics. For "God," I'll translate as "Allah." I'll also preserve Islamic terms like "aqaid" or "manhaj" in English, and use consistent scholarly transliteration where appropriate, like "Ashʿarī" for "عقيدة الأشعرية."

Translating Islamic terms and references
For Quran references, I'll translate chapter headings and verses, like "[يونس]" to "[Yūnus]." I'll include " ﷺ" for prophet references and use appropriate phrases like "may Allah be pleased with them" for "رضوان الله عنهم." I’ll retain ALA-LC transliteration for narrators like Abū Ḥurayrah, and use "Muʿtazilah and Jahmiyyah" for specific terms. Translation should be consistent.

Translating hadith and Qur'an accurately
I’ll use "Abū Ḥurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, said: I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say:" for hadith content. I'll ensure the hadith is translated literally and include references like "Muslim in his Sahih (152)" in the correct format. For names like "Abu Hanifa," I’ll use conventional transliteration, and for Qur'an verses, like Surah Yūnus 10:32, I’ll ensure accuracy with translation: "So what is there after the truth but error?"

Translating verses and commentary accurately
For verse Al-Isra 17:18 (Surah Al-Isra), the translation would be: "Whoever desires the immediate (life), We hasten for him therein whatever We will for whom We will; then We will assign him to Hell, where he will burn, disgraced and rejected." I'll include Ibn Kathir's commentary and respectful salutations: "May Allah send blessings upon our Prophet Muḥammad ﷺ and his family and companions." I'll ensure the translation follows the user's instructions carefully.

Translating narrators and names appropriately
For the hadith narrators, I'll use ALA-LC transliteration, like "Abū Ḥurayrah." However, Tirmidhi is a compiler, not a narrator, so I’ll leave it as "at-Tirmidhī" or the conventional "at-Tirmidhi" without diacritics. Similarly, I'll use common forms for other names like Abu Hanifa, Malik, and Ahmad ibn Hanbal without diacritics to follow the instructions for accuracy.

Translating Islamic terms carefully
I'll use the requested Islamic technical terms like "ʿaqīdah," "manhaj," and "jarh wa taʿdīl" in Latin letters, keeping the Arabic script limited to ﷺ where appropriate. For example, "Hanafis or Malikis or Shafi'is or Hanbalis" without using Arabic characters. The final translation will follow the user's instructions, carefully revising each section.

I need to preserve specific IDs and ensure the accuracy of technical terms like aqeedah, hadith sciences, and tawhīd. I'll use ALA-LC for transliterating names of narrators but avoid it for other terms. I'll translate Prophet Muhammad’s title as ﷺ and God as Allah, following all the given constraints.

Translating Quranic text
For the user’s request, I’ll translate the Quranic verses, poetry, and chapter headings accurately. I’ll maintain numeric markers and IDs, and translate "الله" as Allah. For verse citations, I’ll keep the original surah names and numbers in transliteration unless directed otherwise, ensuring clarity while staying true to context.

Translating surah names and contents
Since I need to avoid Arabic script except for ﷺ, I’ll transliterate surah names, like "Al-An'am" for الأنعام. I’ll also use common English names for clarity, like "Muhammad" and "Saad." Chapter headings should be translated and IDs preserved. I'll translate "P21 - الحمد لله..." as a heading while ensuring "God" is translated as "Allah."

Translating with care and precision
In religious contexts, I’ll stick to the literal phrasing, like using "Allah said" or "Allah, Exalted, said." I'll avoid markdown and ensure the ﷺ symbol is in plain text. I'll keep IDs (like P21) intact. For Quranic verses, I'll include both the English translation and a citation like [115-Al-An'am]. I'll perform multiple revision passes for accuracy.

Translating Quranic verses and surah names
For the translation of verses, I’ll stick closely to the standard text. The verse "And the word of your Lord..." will be translated as usual, and I’ll use the citation [115–Al-An'am] with common transliteration. The verses from Surah Muhammad and Surah Saad will also follow standard translations, using Sād for consistency. Each verse will retain its reference number, ensuring clarity while being literal.

Translating Islamic terms with precision
I need to be accurate with technical terms like "Tawhīd al-Rubūbiyyah" (Lordship), "Tawhīd al-Ulūhiyyah" (Divinity), and "Tawhīd al-Asmā' wa al-Ṣifāt" (Names and Attributes). I’m using precise English explanations and translations for terms like "al-mumaththilah" (anthropomorphists) and "al-mu'ṭilah" (negators). Also need to ensure verse translations are aligned with standard representations.

Using correct Islamic terminology and names
I need to use the transliterated terms for Islamic theology like "Tawhīd al-Rubūbiyyah" (Lordship), "Tawhīd al-Ulūhiyyah" (Divinity), and "Tawhīd al-Asmā' wa al-Ṣifāt" (Names and Attributes). Additionally, I’ll use "al-mumaththilah" (anthropomorphists) and "al-mu'ṭilah" (negators). For Sheikh Imam Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, I’ll adhere strictly to the ALA-LC rules where applicable.

Transliterating names and ensuring accuracy
For non-narrator names, I’ll follow conventional transliteration unless otherwise specified. For example, "Sheikh Imam Muhammad ibn 'Abd

To preserve proper transliteration, I’ll only apply ALA-LC system to narrator names (like al-Ṭabarānī and ibn ʿAbbās) in chains. The Arabic text itself won’t be transliterated, and Arabic-only characters like ﷺ will remain as they are. I’ll also keep names like ‘Ā’isha as required.

Deciding on transliteration for non-chain narrator names
Since the instruction is to apply ALA-LC transliteration only to narrator names in a chain, it seems safe to leave "عائشة" as "Aisha" when it's not part of the chain. Regular translation of names into English should be fine in these cases where transliteration doesn't apply.

Clarifying ALA-LC transliteration for narrator names
The instruction says to use ALA-LC for narrator names in the chain with diacritics, so "عائشة" should be transliterated as "ʿĀʼishah" instead of "A'isha." The key here is to focus on the names in the chain itself, not the rest of the textual content. This matches the earlier guidelines.

Translating narrators' names and attributes accurately
Since they asked to transliterate narrator names (like A'isha) in ALA-LC, "عائشة" will become "ʿĀʾishah." For other terms, "النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم" will stay as ﷺ, and "Allah" will be used for the reference to God unless it's "ilāh" in Arabic. We’ll use these principles for accuracy, checking multiple times.

Translating and preserving narration accuracy
For the hadith references, I need to preserve the names of narrators with ALA-LC transliteration, like al-Ṭabarānī for الطبراني and Ibn ʿAbbās for ابن عباس. Also, I should ensure accurate translations of Quranic verses, including Surah and verse numbers, and avoid markdown, sticking to plain text. All IDs should be retained, too.

Clarifying transliteration and translation requirements
I need to follow ALA-LC guidelines for transliterating narrator names like Muḥammad with diacritical marks, al-Ṭabarānī, and Ibn ʿAbbās. For A'isha, I'll use ʿĀʾishah with the hamza. For رضي الله عنها/عنهم, I'll translate it as “may Allah be pleased with her/them.” Also, السلسلة الصحيحة [1272] will be translated to "the authentic series [1272]".

I need to follow a lot of specific rules here. For example, I should translate Arabic to English literally when possible, maintaining chains of narration and using ALA-LC for narrators' names. I also have to ensure alignment for numeric markers and revise the translation three times to be sure it's accurate. For instance, for 'عبادة', it seems 'ʿUbadah' or 'ʿUbāda' fits the ALA-LC style.

Applying ALA-LC for Arabic names
I need to use ALA-LC for transliterating names of narrators, like 'Abū Hurayrah' for 'أبو هريرة', 'ʿUmar b. al-Khaṭṭāb' for ‘عمر بن الخطاب’, and 'ʿĀ’isha' for ‘عائشة’. Collectors like Bukhari or Muslim should stay in English, e.g., "narrated by al-Bukhārī (1154)".

Applying macrons to vowel sounds in ALA-LC
I'm following ALA-LC guidelines and using macrons for long vowels, such as 'ā', 'ī', and 'ū'. For example, names like 'Abū Hurayrah', 'Ibn ʿAbbās', and 'ʿUmar b. al-Khaṭṭāb' fit this pattern. I'll only apply ALA-LC for narrator names in the chain, not collectors like al-Bukhārī, though they are also names.

Transliterating narrators and collectors
The instruction specifies that ALA-LC transliteration is only for the narrators' names in the chain, not the text. While collectors like al-Bukhārī aren’t narrators, they still play a role in citations. I'll transliterate names like al-Bukhārī, Muslim, and al-Tirmidhī, using macrons where needed (e.g., al-Bukhārī, al-Nasāʾī).

Translating phrases and technical terms
I’m supposed to follow ALA-LC transliteration only for names, not for textual content. For phrases like "لا إله إلا الله" I should translate as "There is no god but Allah" while preserving key terms like tawḥīd and shahada. Diacritics like macrons are important for names, but the focus is translating technical Arabic terms into English, while avoiding Arabic characters except for ﷺ.

Translating technical terms carefully
The user specified transliterating only the names of narrators using ALA-LC, but did not prohibit other terms. For technical terms like tawḥīd, shahāda, and adhkār, I'll stick with common conventions such as using the English translation first, with the transliteration in parentheses. For phrases like "كلمة التوحيد," I'll translate to avoid confusion.

Translating narrators and maintaining ALA-LC precision
For "كلمة التوحيد," I’ll use "the phrase of tawḥīd ('There is no god but Allah')." As for narrators like ʿUbāda b. al-Ṣāmit, I will follow ALA-LC guidelines for names in the chain, using 'b.' for ibn and writing 'ʿUbāda b. al-Ṣāmit' to maintain accuracy. For actual phrasing, I’ll prioritize clarity and consistent translation.

Preparing list of narrators with ALA-LC guidelines
For ALA-LC, I’ll use transliteration carefully to stay consistent: 'ʿUbāda b. al-Ṣāmit' for عبادة بن الصامت, 'ʿUmar b. al-Khaṭṭāb' for عمر بن الخطاب, and 'ʿĀʾisha' for عائشة, among others. However, some terms like "the Prophet ﷺ" stay untranslated. I’ll ensure names and terms follow the correct conventions, using macrons and symbols where needed.

Clarifying ALA-LC transliteration for narrators and references
For certain terms, I’m following ALA-LC conventions: "ʿĀʾisha" with hamza, "Abū Dāwūd" for "اب

I need to make sure I don’t transliterate general names unless specified. "Translate 'God' as Allah unless it's referring to a different concept in Arabic." For names like Ibrahim, I should use "Ibrāhīm" per ALA-LC, but I'll skip the transliteration for regular names in the text and just translate commonly known versions.

Transliteration guidelines for Islamic content
The user specified ALA-LC for narrator chains only, and no Arabic characters except ﷺ. Since ALA-LC uses diacritics, I’ll avoid them for non-narrators. Instead, I'll stick with standard anglicized names (e.g., Salim al-Tawil) for translations, making sure not to include other Arabic characters unless ﷺ.

Translating names and titles
I need to express "شيخ الاسلام المجدد محمد بن عبدالوهاب" in a way that aligns with the user's instructions. Since ALA-LC should only be used for narrator chains, I'll go with the more familiar academic transliteration without diacritics, rendering it as "Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab." For consistency and readability, I'll apply this approach to other names like "Ibn Batta."

Translating and maintaining structure
I need to focus on translating Quranic verses, salutations, and related content. I’ll ensure that the IDs (P25, P25a, P26, etc.) are preserved in the correct order. After translating, I’ll do three revision passes to verify accuracy and that the transliterations align with the context and markers. Time to produce the translation.

Transliteration of narrators in context
I need to be careful with transliterating narrators. The user specified ALA-LC should only be used for narrators in chains, but "Sa'id ibn Jubayr" and "Mu'adh ibn Jabal" are narrators for reported sayings. Since these names are part of narratives, I’ll use ALA-LC transliteration here, as they're considered narrators.

Transliteration of narrators vs. scholars
I’ll apply ALA-LC transliteration to names of narrators, like "Muʿādh ibn Jabal" and "Saʿīd ibn Jubayr." But for figures like "Ibn al-Qayyim," who are mentioned or quoted as authors, not narrators in a chain, I don’t need to transliterate. For "Ibrā

I need to follow certain rules for translating names in chains, particularly for narrators. The text includes hadith references with narrators’ names, so I need to use ALA-LC standards, with diacritics like “Abū Hurayrah” and “Ḥuḍhayfah.” I’ll ensure the translation respects these rules while keeping text accurate, including preserving ﷺ for “صلى الله عليه وسلم.”

Transliterating Hudhayfah and confirming guidelines
I’m working through the transliteration for "Hudhayfah" (حذيفة). ALA-LC specifies Ḥuḏhayfah, but commonly, it’s rendered as Ḥuḍhayfah. After considering the details, I’ll stick to ALA-LC for narrators, using correct diacritics, like ʿ for ayn and ʾ for hamza. I'll focus on narrators in the chains.

Applying transliteration rules to scholars' names
It looks like the rule is to only apply ALA-LC transliteration for narrators in chains, not scholars' names like al-Qurtubī, al-Nawawī, or Ibn Ḥajar. So, for non-narrators, I can use regular anglicized versions, like al-Qurtubi, without needing diacritics. I’ll still ensure accuracy, especially translating quotes and hadith text correctly.

Ensuring careful revision and following instructions
I'll make sure to do three revisions, although the passes won’t be shown. The translation will carefully reflect "God" as Allah, and I'll use ﷺ for صلى الله عليه وسلم. Quranic verses will be translated with surah and verse numbers, ensuring no Arabic characters except ﷺ, but diacritics like ʿ and ʾ are fine.

Translating with consistency and care
I’ll make sure to follow the transliteration rules, using characters like ʿ and ʾ. For terms like "wali al-amr" ("the ruler/authority"), I’ll keep the translation consistent, possibly using “wali al-amr” in parentheses after the English. I’ll avoid Arabic diacritics except for ﷺ and ensure terms like “aqeedah” are translated correctly. I'll also check scholars' names and use them as appropriate.

Translating and preserving narration chains
I need to follow ALA-LC transliteration for narrators like Abū Hurayrah and Ḥuḍhayfah, using diacritics carefully. For the narration phrase “رضي الله عنه,” I'll keep it as “may Allah be pleased with him” without transliterating it. For hadith text, I’ll ensure the meaning is accurate and literal, keeping the full chain intact when possible.

Ensuring precise verse translations and quotes
For the verse translation, I’ll render Qur'an 9:38 as: “Allah, the Exalted, said: ‘O you who have believed, what is [the matter] with you that, when it is said to you, "Disperse in the cause of Allah," you cling heavily to the earth?’” I’ll preserve accuracy by using "Allah" instead of "God," keeping the bracket [al-Tawbah 38]. I'll follow this with al-Qurtubi's explanation and ensure his name stays as is, along with Sheikh Dr. Saleh al-Fawzan’s appropriately translated name.

Accurate translation and explanation for hadiths
I’ll make sure to translate al-Qurtubi’s commentary correctly: the imam's call to jihad requires obedience, not based on the location, but because of loyalty to the imam. For Sheikh Saleh al-Fawzan, I'll use the common name rendering and translate carefully, noting that even the imam’s sinfulness doesn’t invalidate the obligation. I'll continue with consistency for each section, focusing on key phrases like "rebellion" and "shield". Then,

It seems that the instruction is to use ALA-LC transliteration only for the names of narrators, but no Arabic characters should appear in the response except for ﷺ. So, we should transliterate Arabic names like عمرو خالد into the Latin alphabet and avoid using Arabic characters elsewhere, even for the rest of the content.

Translating Arabic names and speech
Okay, the instruction is to use ALA-LC transliteration for narrators in chains, but for other Arabic names, I'll use common transliterations. For example, "عمرو خالد" becomes "Amr Khaled" and "الدكتور الخطيب" becomes "Dr. al-Khatib." I'll preserve honorifics, avoid Arabic characters, and translate colloquial Egyptian speech literally when needed. I'll also keep "ﷺ" and preserve ID markers.

Translating and interpreting hadith and Qur'anic verse
I need to be careful with the hadith "مارأيت من ناقصات عقل ودين," which translates to "I did not see anyone more deficient in intellect and religion." As for the Qur'anic verse, it's about Iblis refusing to prostrate to Adam, becoming arrogant, and joining the disbelievers. I'll translate it literally from verse 34 of Al-Baqarah.

Translating hadith, Qur'anic verse, and colloquial phrases
I need to handle the hadith "مارأيت من ناقصات عقل ودين," translating it as "I did not see

I need to translate text from P133g onwards while making sure to follow some rules. The key decision seems to be applying transliteration only to names of narrators in the chain, like "Abū Hurayrah," but not other names or the text itself. For compilers like al-Bukhārī, I’ll leave those as they are. I’ll stick to these guidelines to keep things clear and consistent.

Translating with ALA-LC and handling transliteration rules
The instruction is clear: I should only use ALA-LC transliteration for the narrators’ names in the hadith chain, not for other names. For those scholars like Ibn Uthaymeen or al-Nawawi, I’ll use anglicized forms without diacritics. Also, I’ll ensure no Arabic characters, except for ﷺ when referencing the Prophet.

Translating Islamic technical terms with consistency
The guidelines recommend using transliteration for technical terms like "ʿaqīdah," "manhaj," and "jarh wa ta'dil." Since these aren't narrators’ names, they don’t strictly need to follow ALA-LC with diacritics, but it's okay to use them to maintain clarity. Diacritics are allowed here for precision since these are technical terms, not personal names.

Translating with consistency and retaining key details
I’ll stick to using standard transliterations for terms like "aqeedah," "manhaj," and "jarh wa ta'dil." For headings, I'll use sentence case, very carefully translating phrases like "الخلفاء الراشدون الأربعة" to match the meaning. Hadith text will be translated into English, ensuring I use "Allah" unless "ilah" is specifically indicated. Numeric markers and citations (like Bukhari and Muslim references) will stay as is, with no formatting other than applicable quotation marks.

I've been meticulously analyzing the task at hand. My primary focus is understanding the nuances of the request and identifying the critical elements. Currently, I'm concentrating on Salim al-Tawil's specific style and the Islamic context. The goal is to accurately translate his fatawa and articles.

Refining Translation Strategy

I'm now fully immersed in the practical application, segment by segment. This involves rigorous adherence to all style guidelines. I'm focusing on ensuring absolute accuracy. The current focus is on Islamic terminology and preserving the Isnad. I'm employing the ALA-LC transliteration for narrator names. I am doing three passes for the revision process.

Defining Key Terms Precisely

I'm now honing in on precise definitions for crucial terms. I'm carefully weighing options for conveying "Al-Qassas", settling on "The Storyteller". I've finalized translations for "Gheebah", "Tanabuz bil-Alqab", and "Tash-heer", aiming for both accuracy and clarity in English. These refined definitions will ensure fidelity in expressing the author's critique.

Analyzing a Complex Figure

I'm presently dissecting the nuances of Sheikh al-Fawzan's words, particularly a segment where he expresses a strong critique. I'm carefully considering the context, including the implied historical events and the target audience. The goal is to accurately translate his strong message, considering the 1982 timeframe and the implied historical context. I'm focusing on his disapproval of a specific individual.

Dissecting Critical Commentary

I'm now deep into these new additions. I'm focusing on the implied criticisms within the exchanges, like the implications of the "magic box" term. I'm grappling with the tone and intent of addressing these figures. I'm now wrestling with the nuances of phrases like "Magian planning" and "Western backing," aiming to pinpoint their specific meaning within the specific context. I'm focusing on consistency in the analysis. I'm carefully translating the quote from Umar ibn al-Khattab.

Considering the Contextual Nuances

I'm now focusing on the specific quote "Returning to the truth is better than persisting in falsehood," considering its source and accompanying notes. I'm also carefully analyzing page 138, meticulously translating the opening lines, and clarifying the context related to Al-Haytuwi. Key terms like tahrif and dalal are central to this section. I'm working to convey their intended meaning to ensure accurate communication.

Examining New Sources

I'm now fully immersed in the new material. I'm focusing on the televised interview and its verbatim content, meticulously analyzing Hayto's statements, especially his interpretation of the "Hand of Allah" verse. I'm also grappling with his Ash'ari view and its implications. Furthermore, I'm examining the criticisms he levels against those who disagree. I'm carefully translating his statements to ensure accuracy, along with noting contextual shifts.

Deepening Textual Analysis

I'm now fully immersed in the complexities of the textual arguments. I'm carefully analyzing Ibn al-Qayyim's quote from Mukhtasar al-Sawa'iq al-Mursalah. I'm focusing on the context of the pledge (Bay'ah). I'm carefully dissecting the Ash'ari perspective and the use of "Ta'wil" and "Tahrif." I am now focusing on the linguistic arguments and implications of "Biyadayya." Also, I'm examining the hadith on intercession.

Clarifying Textual Interpretations

I'm now focusing on analyzing the quoted verses and hadiths. I'm carefully considering the implications of Az-Zumar 67, alongside the hadiths about Allah's attributes. I'm refining the translations of the quotes, emphasizing clarity and accuracy. I'm meticulously examining the specific nuances of the text related to the "repentant." I'm now fully immersed in the discussions, particularly refuting claims about the Ash'aris.

Revising Critical Arguments

I'm now deep into the material's core arguments. I'm carefully analyzing the debate. I'm focusing on the refutation that Ash'aris aren't Ahl al-Sunnah, and the comparison to Jews/Christians. I'm meticulously dissecting the distinction regarding Sahaba and differing interpretations. I'm also considering the argument on page 138, Stop 6, and I'm analyzing the implications of unnecessary discussions. Finally, I'm verifying the alignment across multiple sections and stops for accuracy.

Confirming Precise Definitions

I'm presently confirming the precise meanings of the discussed terms and arguments. I've successfully cross-referenced "Storyteller," "Calling each other by offensive nicknames," and the theological implications within the text. I've verified the standard translation for the verse, and now am carefully addressing hadith references and names to ensure consistency. I'm focusing on the subtleties of theological terms and specific phrase translations. I'm meticulously comparing the provided passages and stops to ensure alignment.

Analyzing Terminological Choices

I'm presently focused on the final polish and self-correction. I'm double-checking all names and ensuring consistent transliteration, especially with "Hītū." I'm reviewing the "narrated" phrasing for accuracy. I'm focusing on stylistic consistency. I'm ensuring no ALL CAPS headings. I've rephrased "Glory be to Allah," and am verifying accurate translations of key verses like "Yadullāhi fawqa aydīhim." I'm also confirming proper use of "ﷺ."

I've been meticulously analyzing the translation request, focusing on the specialized role and the source material's nature. Understanding Salim al-Tawil's Fatawa is crucial. I'm prioritizing accuracy and cultural sensitivity.

Refining Translation Guidelines

I'm solidifying the translation methodology, emphasizing precision. My focus is on literal translations unless context necessitates adjustments. My attention is now on specific rules: preserving narration chains, ALA-LC for narrator names, "Allah" for "God", and ﷺ, but no other Arabic characters in the response. I'm prioritizing a plain-text format, and a three-pass revision process. I'll maintain ID numbers and never use uppercase chapter headings.

Discerning Da'wah Methods

I'm now focusing on the nuances of proper Da'wah methods, contrasting them with inappropriate approaches. Specifically, I'm examining Sheikh al-Fawzan's stance against utilizing humor and imitation in proselytizing. I'm noting the clear delineation between authentic Da'wah, rooted in Quran and Sunnah, and what's deemed frivolous entertainment, which can even harden hearts. I'm finding this a critical clarification.

Analyzing Foundational Principles

I'm now contemplating specific verses to assess preachers. I'm considering Quranic guidance, mercy, admonition, and Jihad's intellectual dimension (intellectual/spiritual). I'm critical of those who deviate from the Quran's principles, questioning their motivations and adherence. I'm focusing on the contrast between authentic guidance and perceived superficiality. My attention has turned to the essential role of integrity.

Contrasting Repentance Methods

I'm now closely examining the efficacy and validity of various approaches to encouraging repentance. I'm focusing on the dangers of methods that lack muru'ah, and those that deviate from Shari'ah principles. I'm comparing the lasting impact of Shari'ah-based repentance versus more superficial, temporary forms. I'm especially concerned about methods involving imitation, mockery, or falsehood. My key focus is differentiating between genuine and ephemeral displays of remorse. I'm currently assessing the innovator's criticism of scholars.

Analyzing Current Practices

I'm now investigating the tactics of those who accuse others of innovation, focusing on their use of corrupt principles. I'm carefully analyzing their core tenet of not forbidding clear evils, contrasting it with the actual Islamic teachings which command us to enjoin good and forbid evil. This involves dissecting their claim that Salaf only rebuked Bid'ah, and the potential impact of their distorted understanding. I'm focusing on their use of distorted interpretations, considering the broader implications.

Analyzing Hadith Interpretation

I'm now grappling with the nuanced interpretation of hadiths concerning innovation and sin. I'm carefully examining the "Rushing" group's misapplication of the principle that innovation is more severe than disobedience, which is causing them to elevate certain individuals over others, even if they are committing major sins. I'm focusing on their selective interpretation, particularly regarding the hadith about all innovation being misguidance. I am analyzing the hadiths that warn of eternal punishment for certain sins, like image-making.

Examining Sin Severity

I'm now diving into the complex relationship between innovation (Bid'ah) and sin, specifically addressing the claim that all Bid'ah is worse. I'm referencing Ibn Uthaymin's nuanced perspective and his criteria for judging the relative severity of both. I'm focusing on his categorization of Bid'ah and its potential for "advancing before Allah" and difficulty of repentance. I'm considering degrees of both, where Kufr Bid'ah vs Kufr sin would be different than small Bid'ah compared to small sin. Also, the case of a Kufr sin vs a small Bid'ah. I'm aiming to clarify these important principles.

Defining "The Rusher"

I'm now focusing on a specific profile: the "Rusher to Tabdi'". This person's reaction to criticism is noteworthy, marked by an unwillingness to accept any critique directed towards them. I'm noting the apparent contradiction between this person's self-perception of infallibility and their criticisms of others. My analysis is leading me to contrast this behaviour with the wisdom of Umar b. al-Khattab's quote, "Reviewing the truth is better than persisting in falsehood." I anticipate a more detailed critique in my next article, which is forthcoming.

Revising Translation Rules

I'm now refining the translation guidelines. I'm focusing on the formatting, ensuring plain text output without markdown. I'm paying attention to the transliteration of names, proper use of "Allah" and "ﷺ", and correct header capitalization. The plan is to maintain standard verse meanings and include common phrases. I'm also preparing for the third pass, the final polish, to ensure all specifications are met precisely.

Delineating Key Terms

I'm now clarifying the distinctions between "Bid'ah Mukaffirah" (innovation leading to disbelief) and simple "Ma'siyah" (sin). Ensuring this critical difference is maintained during translation is paramount. Currently, I'm focusing on preserving the accurate nuances of specialized terms within this framework. Specifically, I'm analyzing the implications of "Tamash'ur," "Tajahhum," and "Rafd" within this context. I'm focusing on their implications on the overall accuracy of the final translation.

I'm currently dissecting the original request's intricacies. The scope is clearly defined as translating fatawa and articles from Salim al-Tawil's website, necessitating my expertise as an Arabic-to-English translator specializing in Islamic content. This foundational understanding allows me to move on.

Defining Translation Strategy

I've established my translation principles, prioritizing literal accuracy unless the context requires a meaning-based approach. Key technical terms like aqeedah and manhaj are a focus, as is precise handling of narration chains and transliteration (ALA-LC for narrators). I'm also ensuring "Allah" is used consistently, and "ﷺ" is correctly rendered. I've designed a plain text output without unnecessary formatting and retained existing IDs, and implemented a rigorous three-pass review process.

Considering Terminology Choices

I'm now revising the translation, primarily focusing on terminology. I've replaced "party" with the more precise Arabic term "hizb," aligning with its nuanced meaning in this context. The draft also reveals that the author alludes to several errors.

Analyzing Key Concepts

I'm now refining the terminology, particularly in the most recent draft. "Party" is being considered for hizb, while "faction" is another possibility. I'm opting for "foundational principles" to translate ta'silat. Also, I've opted for "draft" for muswaddah. I'm still processing the implication of the passage citing Sayyid Qutb's influence and the use of the terms "tamyi'" and "mumayyi'."

Defining Religious Terminology

My focus is now on the precise translation of key religious terms. I'm carefully evaluating options for words such as mu'min, kafir, mushrik, munafiq, mubtadi', zalim, fasiq, and 'asi, ensuring their nuances are accurately conveyed. I'm also grappling with the crucial terms tamyi' and mumayyi' in light of Sayyid Qutb's writings, carefully examining how these concepts relate to the text's arguments.

Reflecting on Textual Implications

I'm now grappling with the implications of Sayyid Qutb's views and their use of tamyi' and tabdi'. Specifically, I'm analyzing the passage from Al-Zilal to accurately render "softening/diluting the religion" (tamyi') in a way that resonates with its meaning. The draft also involves understanding the context of tabdi' and how it leads to dichotomous claims.

Evaluating Doctrinal Dichotomy

I'm now analyzing the implications of the provided passage, specifically its discussion of bid'ah and the Sunni-innovator dichotomy. The core question revolves around the existence of a "third division" beyond truth/falsehood and knowledge/ignorance, as emphasized by Ibn Ḥazm. This necessitates a careful examination of the passage to translate his exact words.

Addressing the Accusation

I'm now engaged in crafting a rebuttal to the accusation of hypocrisy and the implications related to Ibn Ḥazm's status. I must determine if the accusations hold merit. I'm carefully analyzing the Arabic text and its implications to construct a robust defense. I'm navigating the complexities of theological discourse and defending the translation's impartiality, emphasizing the focus on accurate terminology. The translation strategy remains consistent: prioritizing accuracy.

Contrasting Ideologies

I'm now diving into the text, specifically the accusations of hypocrisy and comparing Sayyid Qutb's words with those of the author. I'm focusing on their perspectives on leadership and how they portray themselves. The text highlights a subtle resemblance between their ideologies, something I'm keenly analyzing for translation.

Examining Conversational Flow

I'm now focusing on the provided dialogue, carefully parsing the conversational exchange between Salim al-Tawil and Sheikh 'Abd al-Ḥamīd al-Raḥmānī. I'm focusing on their exchange of pleasantries, the identification of nationalities and origins, and the Sheikh's educational background and affiliation. I'm analyzing the significance of al-Tawil's response, especially his declaration of being Muslim and his non-affiliation with any specific group.

Discerning Political Nuances

I'm now analyzing the dialogue, especially the Sheikh's criticism of Kuwaiti charitable organizations being run by merchants. The Sheikh's critique of the societies highlights potential political and ideological deviations. The critique seems to target the governance of these organizations and their adherence to religious principles.

Interpreting Ideological Conflicts

I'm now analyzing the text's deeper conflicts, which includes the critique of charitable organizations. This involves understanding the motives of the individuals involved, particularly their engagement in commercial activities and elections. I'm carefully evaluating the text's accusations of "guesswork," highlighting potential biases within the discourse.

Evaluating Critic's Development

I'm now carefully analyzing the shift in the critic's position. Initially, the focus was on criticizing the society, but a gradual transition toward accusations of innovation is evident. I'm noting the escalation from simple critique to more severe accusations, including an evaluation of individuals. This requires careful translation of terms like "tabdi'," the nuanced implications of collecting "errors," and the shift from critical commentary to more definitive judgments.

Synthesizing Accusations

I'm synthesizing the accusation and advice provided in the text. I'm noting the critic's reliance on dichotomous judgments – those aligned with his views are deemed sound, while those who don't denounce the society are suspect. I'm focusing on the advice given to abandon this practice and instead seek knowledge.

Summarizing the Advice

I'm now carefully processing the advice and related discussion within the text. The core message stresses that seeking knowledge surpasses engagement in debates and critiques. The text strongly discourages dwelling on societal issues and encourages prioritizing personal growth and reflection. I'm focusing on the advice offered, particularly the call to leave behind "it was said and he said" and instead focus on genuine self-improvement and repentance.

Reiterating the Main Points

I'm now carefully processing the concluding section. The core message emphasizes the importance of prioritizing seeking knowledge over engaging in arguments, specifically advocating for self-improvement and repentance. The text apologizes for the author's tone and emphasizes the sincerity of their advice. This section reiterates the key points discussed throughout, ensuring a clear and concise summary.

Analyzing Textual Introduction

I'm presently analyzing the text's introductory section, focusing on its initial praise of God and the significance of following truth regardless of its source. I'm carefully considering how to translate the verses and the emphasis on adhering to truth, even from those we might dislike. The goal is to convey the author's primary focus.

Deciphering Deception

I'm now closely analyzing the introduction's content, particularly the implications of accepting truth even from a deceptive source. The focus is translating the key phrases and their implications for the narrative.

Predicting the Outcome

I'm presently anticipating the thief's return, as the Prophet's statement suggests he will. My focus remains on translating accurately, especially the dialogue's subtle nuances and the significance of the repetition.

Observing Dialogue Repetition

I'm now focusing on the repetition within the dialogue, particularly the prisoner's recitation of Ayat al-Kursi and the Prophet's subsequent questioning. The emphasis is on capturing the nuance of the repeated phrases.

Examining Textual Accuracy

I'm now carefully rendering the Prophet's words and the dialogue's implications, particularly the acceptance of truth from an unexpected source. This involves understanding the nuanced concept presented in the hadith. I'm focusing on the repetition and emphasis used in the dialogue.

Analyzing Prophetic Dialogue

I am now focusing on accurately translating the Prophet's response regarding the phrase "What Allah willed and what Muhammad willed," emphasizing the correct theological understanding. The hadith's implications for monotheism and the proper expression of faith are crucial.

Prioritizing Textual Accuracy

I'm now carefully rendering the text. Specifically, I am focusing on conveying the implications of the distractions from truth highlighted in the text, including the concepts of arrogance, desire, ignorance, false interpretation, and the various forms of partisanship. The translation strategy remains focused on accuracy. I'm focusing on the subtle nuances of the text's key phrases.

Evaluating Self-Awareness

I'm now focusing on the text's emphasis on self-awareness and the dangers of internal distractions, specifically focusing on the phrase "what distractions might keep the translator from accurately translating". I'm carefully translating the concepts of arrogance, desire, ignorance, and false interpretations.

Reflecting on Textual Implications

I'm now focusing on the introduction and its implications. The author's praise of God and the significance of truth, regardless of its origin, are key. I'm prioritizing accurate translation of the verses, emphasizing adherence to truth, even from those we might dislike. The goal remains clarity.

Distilling the Essence

I'm presently synthesizing the essence of the passage, recognizing the scholars' relentless efforts in preserving Islamic knowledge. The text highlights a wide array of scholarly pursuits, from Quranic exegesis to Hadith classification, emphasizing the importance of these labors. I'm focusing on the significant categories of taḥqīq, taṣḥīḥ, and taḍ'īf, and translating them accurately.

Defining Scholarly Defense

I'm presently focusing on the scholars' vital role in defending Islam and countering deviations like atheism, preserving Aqidah, and safeguarding the Sunnah. I'm highlighting their vigilance against falsehoods, exemplified by their refutation of Wahdat al-Wujud and Hululiyyah, translating their arguments accurately to represent their defense of orthodox Islamic beliefs.

Evaluating Self-Reflection

I'm now carefully reflecting on the text's implications regarding self-correction. Specifically, the importance of translators' self-reflection and recognizing the potential for arrogance, desire, and ignorance to influence translation. I'm focusing on the phrase "what distractions might keep the translator from accurately translating," ensuring that I remain unbiased.

Addressing Ambiguities

I'm presently revising the translation, focusing on clarifying ambiguous points. Specifically, I'm ensuring the dialogue flows naturally while remaining literal. Idioms require a careful balance; for instance, "striking fifths with sixths" needs clarification. I'm opting to translate as "make wild guesses (striking fifths for sixths)" to preserve the Arabic nuance. Additionally, I'm addressing the phrase "Glory be to me" by correctly transliterating it as "Subhani."

I've begun dissecting the request, focusing on the core elements. Understanding the translator's role and the specific nature of the source material (Fatawa by Salim al-Tawil) is paramount. This initial analysis is crucial for ensuring the appropriate tone and terminology are employed in the English translation. The Salafi context demands a precise and nuanced approach.

Establishing Translation Standards

I've established meticulous criteria for the translation. Accuracy is prioritized with a preference for literal renditions, unless context necessitates a meaning-based approach. The correct use of specific Islamic terminology, like Aqeedah and Manhaj, is crucial. Formatting is equally important, including preserving the full chains of narration, ALA-LC transliteration, and the translation of chapter headings and verses. I will consistently use "Allah" and "ﷺ" when appropriate, and avoid Arabic characters except for the latter. The output will be plain text, maintaining existing IDs and following mixed-case chapter headings. Finally, I will employ a three-stage review process to guarantee precision.

Dissecting the Sermon

I'm now fully immersed in the sermon's specifics. I'm carefully examining the arguments, noting key concepts like "Wulah al-Amr" and the critical stance on "Iftiyaat." The core message revolves around the contentious nature of boycotts, touching upon potential harm and inconsistencies. I've begun mapping out points 6-11, paying attention to the context of the hadith referenced. The tone here is becoming clearer.

Contrasting Interpretations

I'm now focusing on the nuances within the arguments, particularly the contradiction of using Western products while advocating a boycott. This point, along with the harm to Muslim merchants, forms a central theme. I'm carefully examining the Iran-related arguments, including the implications of their stance on the Companions. I'm also analyzing the anecdote, and contrasting views from scholars like Ibn Baz and Ibn Uthaymeen, highlighting potential Takfir implications. I need to ensure the Quranic verse is accurately translated.

Examining Discrepancies

I'm now focusing on discrepancies. The conflicting claims about Al-Luhaidan's fatwa and the storyteller's accusations are the primary focus. This requires careful verification to ensure factual accuracy. Additionally, I'm analyzing the context of the refutation regarding MP Faisal Al-Duwaisan's arguments concerning blessings from graves. The use of weak evidence and misinterpretation of Hadith presents a crucial point for dissection, especially concerning the comparison to a "spider's web." The implications of the question posed, why warnings exist if the Ummah cannot commit Shirk, are also under my scrutiny.

Exploring Prophetic Warnings

I'm presently focusing on the nuances of the Prophet's statement concerning the Ummah's collective steadfastness. I'm examining the "Hour will not be established" hadith and its implications. Also, I'm analyzing the Dhat Anwat hadith (Point 8), the concept of seeking blessings from trees versus Allah's direct granting, and the implications. I'm actively assessing the Mandakar Hajj Campaign anecdote (Point 9), scrutinizing its narrative about Iranian pilgrims and their misconceptions.

I'm now delving into another Iranian's account (P126a), exploring the role of emotional appeals, the potential influence of Persian Sunni channels, and considering the trend of intellectual conversions toward Sunnism (Point 10), with particular attention to exceptions like the MP mentioned previously.

Synthesizing Final Points

I've reached the final portion of the source, P127, and am synthesizing the key themes: heedlessness, the dangers of replacing Allah's law, worldly competition, defaming rulers, neglecting istighfar, and false oaths. I'm focusing on the cures presented for each disease, referencing relevant verses and hadiths. This final section reinforces the overall call for piety, adherence to Islamic law, and warnings against innovations. I'm carefully connecting these themes to the broader arguments presented throughout the source, noting Sheikh ‘Abd al-Raḥmān al-Sa‘dī's quote.

Reflecting on Cures

I'm now fully immersed in the final section, P127a, meticulously analyzing the last set of "diseases" described and their corresponding cures. I'm focusing on the cures prescribed for each, referencing specific verses and hadiths. This includes the cures for backbiting, instigation, bribery, hypocrisy, and the pursuit of lenient fatwas. I'm taking a moment to fully grasp the importance of sincerity, fearing Allah, and respecting scholars, as emphasized in the presented cures.

Summarizing the Closing

I'm now fully immersed in the final part, focusing on the cures and closing dua. I'm carefully analyzing the final duas, incorporating the emphasis on seeking refuge from trials and errors. I'm also examining the specific disease/cure pairings, for example, the curing of ID fraud, and false promises made by candidates, through emphasizing honesty and fulfilling promises. I'm meticulously analyzing the section addressing Zionist aggression on Gaza, emphasizing the importance of referring to authorities during times of crisis, and examining the critique of Nabil Al-Awadi's narrative.

Reviewing the Rebuttals

I'm now fully dissecting the rebuttals presented in the source, particularly those addressing the allegations against the author. I'm focusing on the refutation of the claim about praying for Hamas's defeat and the denial of being a Jew. Analyzing the provided footnotes is crucial for establishing context. I'm also now examining the discussion on the demolition of mosques, scrutinizing the justification provided and its implications within the broader Islamic framework. This section warrants careful examination.

Examining Mosque Demolition

I'm now focusing on the nuances surrounding mosque demolition and its permissibility. I'm carefully reviewing the interpretations of relevant verses, like Al-Baqarah 114, and how they relate to historical contexts and contemporary situations. I'm paying particular attention to the perspectives of the Standing Committee, Ibn Baz, and the justifications for demolition based on Sharia law or public interest. Furthermore, I'm cross-checking the proper names, such as al-Luḥaydān and Ibn 'Uthaymīn, to ensure accurate transliteration.

I've begun dissecting the request, focusing on the specialized role required and the source material's nature: Fatawa and articles by Salim al-Tawil. Understanding the source's intricacies is paramount to ensuring accurate and contextually sound translations. I'm now identifying potential terminology challenges within Islamic jurisprudence.

Outlining the Translation Strategy

I've finalized the translation methodology, emphasizing accuracy and adherence to specific linguistic conventions. My priority is precise Islamic terminology and the preservation of crucial details like narration chains and transliteration of narrators' names. The plan includes three revision passes to ensure alignment, contextual accuracy, and correct transliteration, especially regarding P114.

Analyzing the Imagery's Purpose

I'm now delving into the metaphorical elements, particularly the "Sun of the day" and "dwarfs butting heads." I see these as illustrative devices to establish the stature of Shaykh al-Albānī and contrast his scholarly authority with his detractors. I'm noting the specific Quranic verse used, which will be crucial for contextual accuracy in my rendering. The central argument emerges clearly: a robust defense against criticisms of Al-Albani.

Dissecting the Criticisms

Now, I'm examining how the figure's influence is seen, even by detractors who quote him. Satellite channels use him; corrections aren't attributed to others. I see a defense against criticism. Key points include: the accuser's use of specific claims, contrasting sources with authentic ones, and addressing the issue of compound ignorance (Jahl Murakkab). Also, analyzing the double standard, the verse "Die in your rage," and references to Ash'aris.

Investigating Specific Claims

I'm now examining specific claims, like the "sparrow" accusation and the supposed equating of Al-Albani with Bukhari and Muslim. I'm noting the Sufi/Ash'ari elements and contrasting them with genuine Salafi positions. This includes analyzing the anecdote of the Da'iyah and dissecting the logic of using Al-Albani in corrections, referencing Qur'anic verses for context. Furthermore, I'm clarifying the nuances of the "Poet of the Million" incident and the subtle differences in wording. I'm focusing on the reasons for the writer's anger regarding the judge citing Al-Albani.

Refining the Arguments

I'm presently dissecting the specific arguments used, focusing on the hadith status and the call to repentance. Examining the defenses of Tawhid and Sunnah against Shirk and Bid'ah, I'm analyzing the metaphorical language and specific examples, like Ibrahim's approach. Now, I'm noting the distinctions made between believers and polytheists (Wala and Bara) and analyzing the innovator's claims in relation to Iblis. Furthermore, I'm examining the Takfir points, particularly the worship of Awliya' and the implications of making Takfir of the Sahabah, along with related refutations.

Evaluating the Counterarguments

I'm now analyzing the arguments against the Sahabah, focusing on the concepts of nadhr, fear/hope as forms of worship, and the restrictions on tawaf. I'm also addressing the Sufi analogy and employing Ibn Taymiyyah/Ibn Abd al-Wahhab's emphasis on worshipping Allah alone, following the Messenger, and refraining from cursing the Sahabah to form a unified front. I'm noting the call to arm oneself with knowledge to close this section. Finally, I've moved on to examining the Aqeedah of the Sahabah, discussing their definition, status, and associated hadiths.

Assessing the Sahabah's Status

I'm now examining the character of the Sahabah, focusing on their integrity and infallibility. While acknowledging their human fallibility and the historical disputes among them, I emphasize the prohibition against insulting them, referencing the relevant hadith. I've concluded with an explanation of the necessity of remaining silent on disputes.

Analyzing the Fatwas

I'm currently delving into the fatwas on boycotts. Examining the stances of various scholars, I'm noting the general permissibility of purchasing lawful goods unless explicitly forbidden by the ruler. I'm carefully comparing the justifications offered by different scholars, including references to the Prophet's interactions with non-Muslims, like his purchase from Jews. I am contrasting opinions of the Permanent Committee and Bin Baz with those of Al-Fawzan, specifically regarding boycott as a Fard 'Ayn, and scrutinizing supporting evidence, particularly the examples and legal principles presented.

Summarizing the Boycott Debate

I'm now examining the arguments against general economic boycotts. I'm focusing on legal principles, particularly those related to the permissibility of lawful goods. Individual fatwas against boycotts of lawful goods are impermissible. I'm looking at specific examples like the Prophet's interactions with non-Muslims and contrasting views of scholars like Ibn Uthaymin and Al-Fawzan. The context of weak versus strong boycotts and Prophetic era precedents are also central to my analysis.

Evaluating the Pantheism Debate

I'm now examining the "Al-Watan" article, specifically the writer's claim regarding Yuri Gagarin's search for God. The crucial point is the writer's apparent pantheistic phrasing, attributed to the writer rather than Al-Tawil. I'm now clarifying the Arabic text, focusing on the writer's problematic statement about God's presence, contrasting it with standard Salafi doctrine of God's transcendence. I'm taking a close look at the Arabic text to ensure this distinction is clear in my translation.

Analyzing the Quotation's Purpose

I'm now focusing on Al-Tawil's use of the Gagarin quote, which appears critical rather than supportive. The text ends "End of his words by his letters," suggesting Al-Tawil is quoting the writer to expose their theological error. I must now accurately translate this potentially controversial passage to reflect this intended contrast with standard Islamic theology. I am now refining the translation of the exact wording.

Translating Specific Phrases

I'm presently tackling the specific phrases, aiming for precision and clarity. I've confirmed idiomatic translations like "entered history from its widest gates." I'm reviewing the term "Shawaheen" and its context and choosing the best version of "Sibyan al-Tawhid". I've finalized transliterations for "Haytū" and "Al-Būṭī". I'm also ensuring the correct use of "Allah" and reviewing ALA-LC and bolding conventions.

I'm currently honing the translation strategy, focusing on capturing the nuances of Salafi methodology within an English context. The goal is to maintain accuracy while ensuring accessibility for a wider audience. I'm prioritizing clarity and precision to avoid any potential misinterpretations.

Developing Translation Rules

I've been solidifying the translation rules, particularly for Islāmic content (Aqeedah, Manhaj, Hadith) from Salim al-Tawil. Accuracy is paramount, favoring literal translations where possible, but I'm also ensuring correct use of technical terms and preservation of Isnad. I'm carefully managing transliteration (ALA-LC for narrators), and implementing specific directives like translating "Allah" and maintaining precise output formatting.

Addressing Uluww Concepts

I'm now fully immersed in the Uluww (Highness of Allah) debate, dissecting Wahdat al-Wujud (Pantheism) and its refutation. I'm focusing on key terms, accurate verse translations, and the Hadith of the Merciful ones, ensuring precise Islāmic content. Currently, I'm working through the verse interpretations related to Allah's Throne and His separation from creation. The "jugular vein" verse's angelic interpretation is being solidified with supporting quotes.

Formulating the Rebuttal

I'm currently crafting a rebuttal to Faisal Al-Duwaisan's position on seeking blessings from graves. The core argument will highlight his lack of Islamic legal knowledge, employing a critical tone throughout. My framework includes several key points: addressing his reliance on weak narrations, clarifying the distinction between Sunnis and Sufis, and challenging his conflation of different forms of intercession. I will also examine the reality of current grave visitations and define what constitutes Shirk in this context. I will ensure a strong and focused approach, with precise terminology and citations.

Comparing Treaty Interpretations

I'm presently dissecting the nuances in interpretations surrounding peace treaties with Jews. Specifically, I'm comparing the hardline stance of 'Abd al-Rahman 'Abd al-Khaliq, who views such treaties as treason, with the more lenient view of Ibn Baz, who permits them under necessity. My current focus is on meticulously documenting the key arguments, referencing the historical precedent of the Hudaybiyyah treaty, and drafting my critique, paying close attention to the use of "The Scientific List" (Al-Qa'imah al-'Ilmiyyah).

Analyzing Treaty Justification

I'm now fully immersed in the argument. I've been assessing the Islamic legal basis for peace treaties, comparing the positions of Abd al-Rahman Abd al-Khaliq and Ibn Baz. The primary focus is contrasting their interpretations of consultation requirements, particularly referencing the Prophet's ﷺ actions during the Hudaybiyyah treaty. I'm currently scrutinizing Abd al-Khaliq's inconsistent views on societal apostasy (Takfir), and examining Sayyid Qutb's influence. I am also investigating the different types of truces and their conditions.

Synthesizing Treaty Conditions

I'm now integrating the considerations about peace treaties with the specific verses and Hadiths. I'm focusing on the idea that perpetual truces are not permissible, but "absolute" ones are, provided they can be revoked. I'm carefully analyzing the nature of Jewish treachery, as it pertains to treaty agreements. I'm also considering Al-Sa'di's commentary on Al-Anfal, verse 61 ("And if they incline to peace..."). Finally, I'm reflecting on the implications of the closing dua and how the Prophet ﷺ dealt with enemies during periods of weakness, including relevant Hadiths and their implications.

Clarifying Jihad's Purpose

I'm now fully immersed in refining the concept of Jihad. I'm carefully analyzing its purpose as a means to establish the supremacy of Allah's religion, not an end in itself, drawing on the Hadith of Ibn 'Umar. This contrasts with those who advocate for Jihad while themselves engaging in Shirk. I'm also focusing on the implications of Patience, Migration, and Truce.

Dissecting Sectarianism

Currently, I'm analyzing the various forms of Hizbiyyah, categorizing them into Jihadist, political, financial, Takfiri, hierarchical, and Sufi types. I'm also critically examining their aversion to criticism, focusing on the root causes of this defensiveness. Simultaneously, I'm refining my transliteration protocols to ensure consistency with ALA-LC, expanding the list of narrators and scholars.

Finalizing the Terminology

I've been meticulously refining key Islamic terms for this piece. I'm solidifying the meanings of critical concepts like Istawa, Tabarruk, and Fitnah, ensuring they are correctly applied throughout the text. I'm focusing on ensuring consistent translation, for example using "rose over" for Istawa, and ensuring a nuanced understanding of Fitnah. I'm also ensuring all the scholars names are properly transliterated.

Revising Terminology

I'm now revising the translation for consistency, focusing on the proper application of "Allah" and "ﷺ". I'm also ensuring the IDs match the Arabic text. I am currently working on the Hadith chain P119a, with focus on accurate transliteration. Finally, I'm checking the capitalization of headers.

I need to translate from Arabic to English while maintaining specific IDs like P107d, P108, and P108a. I shouldn't use Arabic characters except for ﷺ and must apply transliteration (ALC-LC) only to narrator names in the chain, not the text itself. I'll use common English forms for other scholars' names, avoiding diacritics.

Clarifying transliteration rules
I need to follow the instruction strictly and apply the ALA-LC transliteration only to names in the hadith chain, like Muʿādh ibn Jabal. For others like Abu Dawud, al-Albani, and al-Bukhari, I'll just leave them without diacritics, even though some are still scholars named in the reference but not in the chain itself.

Deciding between translation and transliteration
I have to preserve the full chain of narration, so I'll use "From Muʿādh ibn Jabal ... he said: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:". For technical terms like "walī al-amr", I'll use a combination of translation and transliteration, for clarity, like "the one in authority (walī al-amr)". The term "Allah" stays as it is.

Deciding between translation and transliteration
The user specifically asked for ALA-LC transliteration only for the names of narrators in the isnad, not for terms. So, I’ll stick to translating Islamic terms like "walī al-amr" into English ("the ruler" or "the one in authority"), without using transliteration unless it's part of the chain of narration.

Deciding on transliteration and translations
For terms like "wali al-amr," I'll go with "the ruler (the one vested with authority)" without transliteration. For headings and proverbs, I’ll translate them, maintaining structure—e.g., "Along with pardoning, there must be rectification." For surah names, I’ll err on the side of translating them, like using "The Table" rather than transliterating.

Translating and transliterating accurately
I’ll keep surah names in common English or standard transliterations without diacritics, like "al-Ma'idah". For narrator names like "Muʿādh ibn Jabal," I'll use ALA-LC transliteration with diacritics. For phrases like "لا إله إلا الله," I’ll translate as "There is no deity except Allah," keeping accuracy and consistency.

Translating and maintaining clarity
For transliteration, I'll use common English terms for sects like "Jahmiyyah" and "Mu'tazilah." For "حزب البعث الاشتراكي العفلقي", I'll use "the Aflaqist socialist Baath Party." I'll translate terms like "سني" as "Sunni" and maintain technical language. For "شبهة," I’ll go with "dubious argument" or "specious argument," depending on context. Translating Quran verses, headings, and proverbs will follow clear, non-Arabic formatting.

Translating and maintaining meaning
For translating the verse from al-Nur 11: regarding slander, I'll follow the literal translation but ensure clarity: "Indeed, those who came with the slander are a group among you; do not think it bad for you; rather it is good for you."

I'll also translate terms like "ahl al-ahwa'" as "people of caprice" and maintain literal translations for phrases like "more evil than anyone who has ever trodden upon pebbles." Additionally, I’ll maintain key du’a phrases and clarify the issue of apostasy, mentioning conditions for uttering faith.

Addressing belief, repentance, and apostasy
I’ll discuss evidence from the Quran and Sunnah, highlighting the necessity of disbelieving in taghut. I'll mention the Baath party as atheistic and translate their poet's verse about believing in the Baath. Following, I’ll address Saddam's apostasy, emphasizing the certainty of his kufr while considering the possibility of repentance, yet emphasizing evidence of him not repenting.

Discussing judgments about Saddam and beliefs
The discussion focuses on whether we harm Allah by labeling Saddam as a disbeliever (kafir). I’ll explore related verses, addressing believers and criminals, and the importance of not equating the doers of good with evil. There’s also mention of how people wrongly call Saddam a martyr, despite his corrupt actions.

Translating Arabic text guidelines
I need to translate segments from Arabic text, maintaining IDs like P109a, P109b, and so on. I should avoid Arabic characters, except ﷺ. For Qur'anic references, I'll keep transliterations like [al-Mā'idah: 3]. Narrator names will use ALA-LC transliteration, but only if they're part of a chain or hadith quote.

Transliteration guidelines for proper names
The instruction says to use ALA-LC transliteration only for narrators in an isnad chain, but there’s no full isnad here, just a hadith quote. For proper names outside the chain, I can likely use standard English transliterations without diacritics. For references like "رواه البخاري 6074," I’ll render it as "reported by al-Bukhārī (6074)" with diacritics.

Handling Arabic transliteration choices
The instruction specifies ALA-LC for narrator names in a chain, and while diacritics aren't mandatory for other names, I think users might expect ALA-LC for all Arabic names. To keep it simple, I'll use ALA-LC transliteration for all proper Arabic names, ensuring highest accuracy without violating the "only" rule.

Interpreting transliteration instructions
The rule says to use ALA-LC only for narrators in a chain, but names outside the chain might still require standard transliteration. To stay safe, I’ll use conventional English spellings without diacritics for non-narrator names, like Muhammad bin Salih al-Uthaymin or Abdulaziz bin Baz, since there are no chains here.

Finalizing transliteration and translation guidelines
I can use ALA-LC for names outside of chains, but will avoid diacritics. For Qur'anic verses and citations like those from Ibn Baz, I’ll translate the content and keep the surah names transliterated, such as "al-Nisā’: 29." For headings, I’ll provide clear translations. I’ll maintain segment IDs like "P109a -" as instructed.

Finalizing translation and citation placement
I will translate the content as per the user's request, ensuring that I include each segment's content accurately. I’ll maintain the requested plain text formatting while including the required citation at the end in plain text. I'll also ensure that my translations reflect the meaning correctly, such as the discussion about shubha and fatwas.

Translating key segments accurately
I'll translate the segments with care, ensuring that sensitive details, such as the quotes from Ibn Baz, are respected. For example, in P109d, the discussion of self-detonation and the quote from Bukhari should be rendered correctly. In P110, I'll highlight the discussion of imamate, its historical context, and the quotes from Shaykh Ibn Uthaymin, while maintaining precision.

Translating the concepts on leadership and debates
In this segment, I’m addressing the importance of leadership in both religious and administrative contexts, as emphasized by the author. There’s a discussion about obeying leaders as long as it doesn’t contradict Allah’s commands. Additionally, there is a critique about unregulated debates within certain groups and individuals questioning religious principles.

Ensuring consistency in Arabic terms and translation
I need to make sure I’m translating key Islamic terms correctly, like "Ahl al-Sunnah wa'l-Jama'ah" and "Salaf". For words like "jihad" and "suicide operations", I should use transliteration or direct terms like "jihad" as long as it matches the context. I'll use standard orthography and adjust for consistency while avoiding Arabic characters. Specific terms like "may Allah have mercy on him" should also stay consistent across translations.

Translation consistency and considerations
When translating phrases like صلى الله عليه وسلم, I’ll use ﷺ effectively where it’s explicitly mentioned after Prophet Muhammad. In other cases, I’ll translate phrases like “may Allah send prayers and peace” without using Arabic characters, except for ﷺ, a ligature allowed. I’ll also ensure accurate translation of terms like "al-Mustaqilla" and "Book and Sunnah". I need to translate the poetry and make sure the overall meaning remains faithful, like translating "Allah forbid" for "العياذ بالله".

Including proper citation with file reference
I need to remember to cite the file correctly with filecite. I'll place the citation

Reading documents
Reading documents

Handling headings and segment IDs
The headings like "الشبهة الخامسة" are between P109a and the following lines, which lack IDs. Since the note says to preserve IDs at the beginning, I should translate headings as standalone lines but leave the ID usage intact. I'll skip IDs for headings that don’t have them, keeping the structure clear. I'll answer in plain text as instructed.

Deciding on handling lines without IDs
It seems like I can translate lines that don't have IDs without adding new ones. After translating P109a, I'll include the line "The fifth specious argument" as a separate line. I'll follow the same approach for P109b with "The sixth specious argument" and quoted titles like "بعض فتاوى العلماء". I'll keep everything consistent, including translating phrases like "فأقول" and avoiding any untranslated Arabic characters. Time to craft the translation!

Translating and clarifying P109a text
So, I say: This is a weak, almost nonexistent argument. The principle that the one who causes an injury shares the ruling of the direct perpetrator is mentioned in the chapter on criminal injuries. For example, if someone digs a pit to cause another’s death, or pushes someone into harm’s way, they face retaliation. However, no one equates suicide with performing jihad in Allah's path. Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jama’ah derives its teachings from the Book, the Sunnah, and what the Salaf of the Ummah practiced.

Clarifying the Salaf of the Ummah’s stance and P109b translation
Looking at the practices of the Salaf of the Ummah, we find no evidence that they understood jihad to include self-harm. We'll continue being cautious about this.
Now, for the fifth shubha: "Some claimed that youths who died by suicide had righteous dreams signaling they were in a good place."
Response: "Subhan Allah! Dreams are not a source of law. Allah has perfected His religion and completed His favor, as He said: 'Today I have perfected for you your religion, completed My favor upon you, and have approved Islam for you as a religion.'" [al-Ma'idah: 3]

Clarifying the fatwas on suicide and the 6th shubha
Referring to a statement from Shaykh al-Uthaymin, he says that those who kill themselves will be punished with the method they used, and that such individuals are not martyrs, as martyrdom comes from obeying Allah, not disobeying Him. Now, the 6th shubha: Some claim fatwas approve of suicide operations.
Response: "The fatwas you mentioned can be of two types: one covering the ruling on suicide operations and the other from the Permanent Committee."

Regarding a woman's fear of assault: Islam does not permit suicide, even in such cases. She may be excused if assault happens without her consent.

Clarifying Shaykh Abdulaziz ibn Baz's response on suicide bombings
Shaykh Abdulaziz ibn Baz’s ruling states that it is impermissible to use explosives in self-inflicted attacks, especially targeting others. As Allah prohibits suicide, and the Prophet ﷺ warns against using actions to kill oneself, such actions are not acceptable. He advocates for guiding others through proper methods like teaching and advising.

Also, I'll translate the book title as: Reminding the Servants with the Fatwas of the People of Knowledge Regarding Jihad by Muhammad al-Husayn, avoiding a transliteration.

Reflecting on proper salawat and the introduction of a lesson
When marking dedication, I’m thinking about salawat (prayers upon the Prophet ﷺ). The phrasing can vary, but I’ll include “ ﷺ” after Muhammad while also respecting traditional forms like “وصلى الله وسلم وبارك على نبينا محمد." Now, transitioning to the content, the shaykh Muhammad ibn Salih al-Uthaymin’s words on imamate and jihad are insightful and beneficial.

Reflecting on the importance of imamate and jihad knowledge
In the past, we overlooked the necessity of understanding the rulings of jihad and imamate. However, through reflection, it's clear that it's vital to know who the imam is, what their rights are, and what the people owe them. Many people, sadly, misjudge and criticize without true understanding. As a Salafi Ummah, we must learn to navigate these issues carefully.

Reflecting on imamate and 'aqidah
When comparing our deeds and 'aqidah with the Companions, the difference is vast. A key teaching is "as you are, so will be appointed over you." Imamate has two meanings: in religion (such as leading prayer) and in administration. The imam in prayer is a religious leader, guiding in actions like bowing and prostrating.

Preserving translations and terms
The author says, "There is no dispensability for the Ummah of Islam in every age from an imam." "Obedience to rulers" is translated as "those in authority." The only shar'i reason to disobey is when they command disobedience to Allah. Key terms like "Shaykh al-Islam" and "'aqidah" will be used as they are.

Considering transliteration vs. diacritics in proper names
For the hadith chain, I should use diacritics for narrators, as per the instructions. For other scholars or names, I can use standard transliteration or common English versions without diacritics, even though there’s some ambiguity about whether to include them in citations. I'll prioritize clarity and the given rules.

Translating hadith and Quran references
For hadith, I should use "the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said" and replace (صلى الله عليه وسلم) with ﷺ. For Quran verses, I'll provide literal translations and preserve meaning, keeping verse citations in English—such as [al-A'raf: 33]. Surah names should be transliterated using standard English or Latin characters, with no Arabic letters.

Translating and maintaining consistency in references
I'll keep Quran references in their original numeric form, like [al-Baqarah: 168-169], without correcting numeric prefixes. Hadith citations should use familiar formats, such as "narrated by al-Bukhari." For God, I'll translate as "Allah" unless it directly refers to "ilah." Translating the text requires multiple internal revisions to ensure everything aligns correctly.

Translating "لا إله إلا الله" and related terms
For "لا إله إلا الله," I'll use "There is no ilah except Allah" to stay close to its literal meaning. "Ilah" can be translated as "deity" or "a deity" when needed. For terms like "Rafidah," I'll keep the original, and for others like "fa'idah," I'll translate as "valuable benefits" while using straightforward terms like "man" when appropriate.

Translating personal names and hadith citations
For the hadith chain, we’ll include names with diacritics like “Saʿīd ibn al-Musayyib” but keep "his father" without transliteration. Though “al-ʿAbbās” is part of the hadith, he’s not explicitly a narrator in the chain, so using “al-‘Abbas” without diacritics works fine. We’ll follow instructions for chain narrators but stay cautious with transliteration elsewhere.

Deciding on transliteration for narrators and scholars
For narration chains like "Abu Hurayrah," I'll use ALA-LC transliteration with diacritics. Even though some names aren’t explicitly part of a chain, I think it's better to apply the transliteration to all hadith narrators, including Ibn ʿAbbās. For scholars like Ibn Uthaymeen, no diacritics needed.

Ensuring plain text formatting with citations
The user requested plain-text, but the filecite syntax includes special characters, which may violate this formatting. However, citations are required, so I'll follow the tool's instructions and include them inline. I think the best approach is to place the citation at the end of the first segment to maintain clarity without breaking the user's rules.

Integrating citations and translating segments carefully
For the citation, I think it's best to place it at the end of the first segment’s ID line, right after the final sentence within the segment, so that it doesn’t interfere with the flow. For the translation, I'll stick to the original format and translate accordingly, keeping "Benefit (5)" as a placeholder, and ensuring the poetry and verse translations are clear with proper punctuation.

Translating Quran quotes and addressing fatwas
We’ll translate the Quranic quotes into plain text, keeping them literal and within quotation marks. For P111a, we’ll address the issue of issuing fatwas without knowledge and the dangers associated with modern fatwas on things like elections. The lesson emphasizes keeping away from distractions like political involvement, focusing instead on callings that lead to taqwa.

Translating names and texts correctly
I’ll go with using ALA-LC transliteration for names like "Abū Hurayrah" and "Anas" without diacritics. For books like "Ṣaḥīḥ al-Jāmiʿ", I’ll transliterate it to "Sahih al-Jami'" without diacritics to stay safe. When translating prayers for the Prophet, I’ll use "may Allah send prayers, peace, and blessings" to keep it clear.

Translating nuances thoughtfully
I’ll keep translations as literal as possible but still respect context. For phrases like "as he ﷺ said," I might use "as he said, upon him be peace" for accuracy. I'll follow instructions about using " ﷺ" only when "صلى الله عليه وسلم" is used verbatim. I'll space out narrators' names like Saʿīd and avoid diacritics for non-narrator names like Abu Jahl.

Translating key narratives carefully
I’ll follow guidelines to ensure accuracy in transliteration—names like Abū Hurayrah, Ibn ʿAbbās, and Saʿīd will use ALA-LC. For non-narrators or those outside the chain, like Abu Jahl or Abd al-Muttalib, I’ll avoid diacritics. I’ll translate Quranic verses in braces and use Latin script for all references to avoid Arabic characters, maintaining clarity.

I need to translate Arabic into English while keeping IDs intact. Qur'an verses and hadith should be fully translated, not just left in Arabic, but I must avoid Arabic characters except for ﷺ. The ALA-LC transliteration should apply only to narrator names in the chain, not the overall text. So for narrators like "Abū Saʿīd al-Khudrī" and "Abū Mūsā al-Ashʿarī", I should use transliteration where necessary.

Handling transliteration for non-narrator names
For names like Abu Talib, Khadijah, Hamzah, and al-'Abbas, I don’t need to use diacritics or ALA-LC transliteration, since they’re not part of the narrator chain. For non-narrator Islamic names, I'll use plain anglicized forms without diacritics. Narrators in the chain, like Abū Saʿīd al-Khudrī, will follow ALA-LC rules with diacritics.

Handling translation of blessings and symbols
For "صلى الله عليه وسلم", I will replace it with ﷺ, as instructed. "عليه الصلاة والسلام" should likely stay as it is, unless the phrase specifically matches the first one. For "صلى الله وسلم وبارك", I'll translate it in full to capture the meaning without using the symbol, as it doesn't match. I'll stick with these guidelines to keep it consistent.

Aligning segment IDs and translation notes
I need to make sure to include segment IDs like "P112a", "P112b", and "P113" at the start of each segment with a hyphen. I'll also translate chapter headings like "فائدة" into English and handle titles like "أما بعد". For Qur'an verses, I'll translate them into English, keeping the sura references without Arabic script. I'll use English names for suras.

Handling transliteration choices for specific terms
I’ll translate sura names into common English transliterations without diacritics, like “Fatir” and “Muhammad.” For hadith citations, I’ll keep the referencing style but modify the Arabic numbers. For technical terms like “ghargharah,” I'll translate them directly, avoiding transliteration unless it's part of a narrator's name. Terms like “Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jama’ah” may stay transliterated, given the instructions about Islamic terminology.

Clarifying transliteration usage rules
The instructions specify using ALA-LC transliteration only on the names of narrators in the chain, with no Arabic script used for other terms. For non-narrator terms like "Ahl al-Sunnah wa'l-Jama'ah," I'll use common transliterations without diacritics. For narrators, I'll apply ALA-LC with diacritics, and I'll translate other terms as needed.

Clarifying translation of Arabic expressions
When translating, I need to be careful with terms like "إله" (ilah) and use "deity" when needed, but for "Allah," I'll stick with "Allah" as instructed. For phrases like "رسولي محمد" I’ll add “ﷺ” after Muhammad as a mark of respect, though it’s only required after "صلى الله عليه وسلم." I'll follow the instructions as closely as possible.

Handling translation of terms and phrases
For Qur'anic verses, I’ll avoid uppercase as it wasn't specifically requested. I'll keep "Muhammad ﷺ" for an honorable translation, even though it's not specifically demanded. I’ll take care with labels like "Jamiyyah" and translate "End quote" from Arabic. Additionally, I’ll ensure no Arabic script is used in translations.

Clarifying translation choices and adjustments
I’ll fix the mismatched brackets like "ولكن الله يهدي من يشاء]القصص ـ 56]" but leave numeric prefixes. "Ghazwat Hunayn" (Battle of Hunayn) will be translated as "martyred that year in the expedition of Hunayn." Also, "صهر النبي" will be translated as "the Prophet’s brother-in-law" for accuracy. I'll provide context for hadith references, explaining meanings carefully about guidance and patience.

Explaining Abu Talib and Jihad discussions
I’ll start by explaining how, even if Abu Talib accepted Islam, he wouldn't have gained benefit from prayers or fasting due to his inability. I'll include the death rattle detail and make sure to clarify the authentic narration about Abu Talib's faith. Then, I'll highlight the discussion on jihad, emphasizing Salafi understandings and conditions.

I need to translate Arabic to English and preserve IDs and headings. Since the instruction is to apply ALA-LC transliteration only to names of narrators in a chain, but there are none here, I’ll stick to using standard English for most names, though I might use ALA-LC for Islamic scholars to ensure consistency with the content.

Translating and transliterating Islamic terms
The instructions say to use ALA-LC only for narrators' names, not general text. I can use common English transliterations for terms like Iran or Ahl al-Sunnah. For technical Islamic terms like “aqeedah” or “tawhid,” I’ll transliterate them, as the instruction allows it for terms but not for regular names.

Preserving headings and technical terms in translation
I’ll use established English or transliterated terms like “‘aqidah” while adding explanations, for clarity. Since plain text is preferred, I’ll keep terms like “creed (‘aqidah)” in parentheses. I’ll preserve chapter headings and IDs as they appear, translating them without altering the case or structure, starting each segment with its respective ID.

Handling Arabic punctuation and religious terms
I’ll replace Arabic quotation marks like »« with standard English quotes. To comply with the instruction, I’ll avoid Arabic punctuation and stick to English punctuation. For phrases like "(اليهود)," I’ll translate to "(the Jews)." Also, I’ll translate “صلى الله عليه وسلم” to ﷺ or as "may Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet."

Translating Islamic terms and technical terms accurately
For “رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم” I’ll use “the Messenger of Allah ﷺ” as instructed. For “وصلى الله وسلم على نبينا”, I’ll use “and may Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet.” I’ll stick to simpler transliterations for terms like Bāṭinī Saba'iyyah and Rafidite state of Iran, avoiding ALA-LC restrictions. Diacritics will be avoided for group names, while keeping technical terms like "tawhid" intact.

Translating phrases and terms within context
I need to translate phrases like "أغزوا الباطنية السبيئة بالدعوة" as "attack with da'wah" or "confront with a call to tawhid." For "أفيقوا," I'll go with "Wake up". I'll also translate technical phrases like "السمع والطاعة" as "listening and obeying". Additionally, I'll preserve specific names and quotes such as "Olmert" rather than transliterating and ensure context is carefully captured throughout the document.

Translating and maintaining clarity in context
For "إلا صلاتي ما اخليها," I'll translate it as "Except my prayer, I will not leave it" and apply it as the title of the nasheed. I'll use the translation consistently throughout. For terms like "taghbir," I'll keep the transliteration while adding any necessary explanations. I'll carefully translate "Ahl al-Sunnah" initially as "the people of the Sunnah."

Translating and maintaining clarity in context
I'll translate "عقيدتهم" as "their creed" and may include "'aqidah" in parentheses for clarity. For "الشهوة," the meaning is "desire." I'll render "أخي المسلم" as "My Muslim brother" and translate phrases like "Rafidite state of Iran" and "foreign disbelieving capitals." For "fiqh al-waqi," I’ll use the transliteration once and translate other terms straightforwardly.

Translating content with careful interpretation
I'll translate the content such as "Batini Saba'iyyah" and their spread across various regions, including Egypt, Africa, Europe, and America. Then I'll address their claims about being more Muslim and spreading rumors. For the spider-house phrase, I'll translate it based on the Quran. I'll also translate the list of contradictions regarding preacher Nabil al-Awadi, clearly keeping the bullet points.

Translating interview and addressing nuances
For the interview translation, I'll preserve terms like "istishhadi" (martyrdom-seeker), explaining it while maintaining its nuance. I'll translate the core content, such as Haniyeh's statements about martyrdom bombers and his stance on violence. I'll also ensure clarity regarding his denial of sending sons into conflict.

Translating key interview points and addressing nuances
I’ll translate Haniyeh’s responses regarding not sending anyone, his stance on meeting with American officials, and his view on potential future agreements. Then, I’ll carefully handle the Islamic discussion on anashid, considering the cultural implications and religious context, ensuring proper phrases like "sending blessings upon the Prophet ﷺ" are included with the necessary respect.

I need to translate the Arabic text into English while keeping IDs intact and only applying ALA-LC transliteration to names of narrators in the chain, like Abu Hurayrah and Ibn Umar. The rest of the content should be translated normally, while keeping names of non-narrators with standard romanization. I'll avoid Arabic script and only use English spellings for names. So, ALA-LC transliteration for the narrators, and regular romanization elsewhere. This seems to be the best balance.

Translating with specific guidelines for names and terms
The rules say ALA-LC transliteration should only apply to names of narrators in the chain, while other names get regular transliteration without diacritics (like Sheikh Falah). For non-narrator names, I'll stick to standard Romanization without diacritics. I must preserve the IDs and headings, like using "First:" at the start. Also, I'll ensure that terms like "الله" translate as "Allah" instead of "God" and use "Most High" for "الله تعالى."

Translating Quran verse and maintaining consistency with transliteration
I'll translate Quran verse 3:31 and provide the reference as [Al ʿImran] in parentheses. For consistency, I'll stick with "Al ʿImran" using ALA-LC transliteration, even though it’s not a narrator’s name. Also, for hadith quotes, I’ll translate the content into English and use terms like "Magians" for Majus and "polytheists" for mushrikun.

Translating technical terms and names
For technical terms like ʿaqidah, fiqh, and tafsir, I’ll use transliteration with macrons since they are technical terms under ALA-LC. For names like “Abu Mu’awiyah,” I’ll transliterate them as they are, without diacritics, since they aren’t narrators. I won’t use uppercase for headings and will follow the rule about avoiding Arabic characters except for ﷺ.

Translating and maintaining structure
I’m translating the complaints and guidelines around lecturers and their behavior with female students. The main points stress avoiding inappropriate interactions, publishing photos, and the need for proper etiquette. There’s also a mention of using screens for lectures, with some students complaining about behavior when direct interaction occurs. I'll keep the level of respect intact and maintain clarity.

Addressing the ruling on shaving the beard
This letter emphasizes the importance of following the Prophet ﷺ, particularly in the matter of not shaving the beard. It mentions the prohibition of shaving for those sacrificing, performing Hajj, or 'Umrah, with references to hadiths. The letters advise growing the beard and trimming the moustache to align with sunnah.

Encouraging obedience to the Prophet’s teachings
This letter urges followers to obey Allah’s commands, specifically regarding shaving the beard, using the example of the Prophet ﷺ. It reminds that despite common practices, the Prophet's example is clear. The passage concludes with prayers for success, peace, and blessings upon Prophet Muhammad ﷺ and his companions.

Reflecting on the state of Muslims amidst New Year celebrations
The passage criticizes the festivities associated with New Year’s celebrations, particularly the sins and indecencies surrounding them. It highlights a group of young Muslims traveling from the USA to Kuwait, seeking to learn from Salafi scholars. Their enthusiasm and commitment to the Sunnah are noted, contrasting them with other youths caught in sin.

Reflecting on repentance and the dangers of misguidance
The story is about a Kuwaiti youth who initially sought repentance, abandoning his past behavior. However, after gaining fame, he returned to his old ways, glorifying music and attacking religion. People recognize the truth now, acknowledging that such individuals cannot be trusted with religious knowledge or fatwas.

I need to translate this Arabic text into English while keeping segment IDs. ALA-LC transliteration applies only to narrators in the chain, like Abu Hurayrah or Ibn ʿAbbās. Without a full chain, I’ll be careful to transliterate these names, but not others unless explicitly in the chain. For "Muhammad," I’ll avoid transliterating unless in a narration context.

Translating while following ALA-LC for proper names
I’ll follow ALA-LC transliteration only for narrators in the chain, like Abū Hurayrah and Ibn ʿAbbās. For other proper names like scholars, I’ll use standard English (e.g., "Muhammad ibn Salih al-‘Uthaymin") without diacritics. Arabic phrases like Allah and ﷺ should be translated. I'll also translate chapter headings and handle examples as "The second example." Parentheses should also be translated, like "الرسالة الأولى."

Translating doctrinal terms while balancing guidelines
I need to translate doctrinal terms like "ḥulūliyya" without Arabic characters. Since transliterating with diacritics seems acceptable, I’ll keep it as "the Ḥulūliyya" but avoid transliterating other names unless necessary. For terms like "waḥdat al-wujūd," I could translate them to English, like "unity of being," to be on the safe side.

Translating doctrinal terms and quotes carefully
I’ll use "incarnationists" for حلوليّة and "adherents of the unity of being" for أصحاب وحدة الوجود, as those are already well-known terms, avoiding unnecessary transliteration. For examples, I’ll stick to phrases like "face in reality" or "descent to the lowest heaven." I’ll ensure quotes are kept intact and provide translations for key verses and concepts, like Surah al-Tawbah 6.

Translating examples and maintaining clarity
For translating examples, I'll use "kufr" for both minor and major, and keep transliterations for names like Abū Hurayrah only. I'll keep hadith intact and translate "Ibn ʿAbbās (may Allah be pleased with them both)" as needed. For letters, I'll transliterate solid names like "Wa-Dhakkir" but avoid diacritics unless necessary. Ensure all guidance carries serious Shari'ah respect, avoiding casual portrayals of religious content.

Translating and maintaining accuracy
The text discusses various topics, from the debate about optional music in schools to reflections on specific religious teachings. I'll focus on maintaining accuracy in translation, especially for Qur'anic verses and important terms. For technical terms like "istawa," I'll be careful with correct phrasing, ensuring clarity while translating Arabic expressions faithfully.

Translating Islamic terms with clarity
I’m weighing the decision between keeping terms like “Ahl al-Sunnah wa-l-Jamaʿah” transliterated or translating them. For technical consistency, sticking with the transliteration "Ahl al-Sunnah" seems accurate but it might be better to translate "the People of the Sunnah and the Community" for more accessibility. I'll stay compliant by using the transliteration without diacritics.

Translating religious text with precision
I need to carefully integrate translations while keeping consistency across terms. For example, translating "عليه" as "upon him" and ensuring phrases like "قلب الحب" become "love-heart". I'll start translating the segments with correct punctuation and avoid Arabic characters in the body, only using transliterations like "Wadhakkir" and "[Taha]" where appropriate. I'll finalize it without Arabic numerals or specific punctuation.

I'm currently focused on defining the parameters of this new translation project. The request seems straightforward initially - translating Salim al-Tawil's Fatawa and articles. However, my analysis deepens as I consider nuances like target audience, desired style, and potentially challenging vocabulary, to ensure accuracy and cultural sensitivity in this Islamic content.

Refining the Approach

I've been meticulously refining my approach to this translation, prioritizing absolute accuracy and a literal translation style unless context explicitly demands otherwise. I'm focusing intently on employing correct Islamic terminology throughout, including concepts like Aqeedah and Manhaj. I'm also ensuring compliance with formatting guidelines like plain text (with exceptions) and the preservation of IDs. I'm particularly careful with Arabic characters, and will translate specific phrases in a certain way. I am also working on a plan for revisions, aiming for alignment, contextual integrity, and accurate transliteration.

Examining the Maqams

I'm now delving into the story concerning Prophet Dawud (David) and his recitation of the Psalms with seventy melodic modes. This relates to an interesting anecdote about a repentant musician who, after his repentance, claimed to have discovered 69 musical modes, or "maqams." This unexpected connection is truly something to consider.

Unpacking the Anecdote

I'm now delving into this intriguing narrative. It connects Prophet Dawud's recitation with seventy "maqams" to a repentant musician who, surprisingly, only found sixty-nine. This leads to brother Adnan's claim, raising questions about his methodology and understanding of Hadith science. I'm carefully examining how his perspective aligns with authentic narrations and scholarly interpretations.

Assessing Corroboration

I'm now examining the connection to Al-Tha'alibi's narration, and how it aligns with my assessment of the earlier hadith. Did I truly intend to offer this as corroboration? If so, how do I reconcile this with my strong stance on Hadith science, especially considering my weakening of a Sahih Muslim hadith? This requires careful review.

Comprehending the Introduction

I'm now focusing on the introductory section of a new article. The "Amma ba'd" greeting signifies the start. I'm carefully analyzing its discussion of a television interview with Adnan Abdul-Qadir, and noting the seventh point. My focus is on understanding the philosophical questions posed during this conversation between Adnan's brother and Secularists/Liberals, and their underlying implications.

Discerning Adnan's Logic

I'm now unpacking the seventh notification, centered on Adnan's call for boldness against Islamic tenets under the guise of liberation. He cites a childhood incident with secularists, claiming it sparked his scholarly path. I am dissecting how this experience supposedly influenced his thinking, particularly the dismissal of religious concepts in favor of critical inquiry. I am analyzing the implications of this incident, and assessing how this relates to my earlier work.

Critiquing the Justification

I'm now carefully examining the incident Adnan cites, where he was questioned about God's existence as a young teen. I'm focusing on his stated intent - to foster liberated thinking in his brother. I'm analyzing the implications of this approach, specifically the critique of exposing a 13-year-old to doubts. I'm drawing comparisons to the teachings of Prophet Muhammad to Ibn Abbas to inform my conclusions about this. My focus is on the concepts of "Talbees" and "Tashkeek", and how these apply to Adnan's justification of his actions.

Dissecting the Narrative

My analysis now focuses on Adnan's justification for exposing his brother to doubts at such a young age. I'm carefully scrutinizing his claim that this experience fostered critical thinking, contrasting it with what I consider a violation of Islamic teachings on safeguarding against doubt. I'm meticulously comparing Adnan's approach with Prophetic guidance, particularly considering the concepts of obfuscation and casting doubt within the context of training for detachment. I find his use of his brother's style to be an invalid style.

Synthesizing Guidance

I'm now contemplating this recent guidance from the Prophet. I'm focusing on the interconnectedness of seeking aid and guidance from Allah. My thoughts are especially on how this wisdom relates to brother Adnan's actions. I'm also reflecting on the implications of this guidance for the previous points. I'm comparing this directly to the new information on Adnan's stance on Nasheeds, Zakat and Acting. I am now considering how this relates to my approach.

Analyzing Adnan's Position

I'm now focusing on Adnan's justification of acting, drawing on fatwas by Ibn Baz and Ibn Uthaymin. He also cites Al-Azhar, and makes direct claims to the permissibility of Zakat for acting. I'm carefully analyzing his justifications and citing of Nasheeds. My assessment of his approach, which seems a little too far, is that he should have been more careful.

Examining the Shift

My current focus is on Adnan's evolving stance, specifically his reliance on fatwas from Al-Azhar, a departure from the traditional Salafi position. I'm carefully analyzing the implications of this shift, considering the potential for a broader embrace of diverse viewpoints and the historical distinctiveness of Salafiyyah. I'm concerned that this trend is leading to a blurring of lines and a weakening of core principles, similar to Ikhwan al-Muslimin, Tabligh, and Takfir.

Analyzing Adnan's Hypocrisy

I'm now intently analyzing the severe contradictions in Adnan's recent statements. He cites a fatwa by Ibn Baz on Zakat's permissibility for acting, yet the Sheikh explicitly condemns acting as Haram. I'm focusing on the implied hypocrisy of this selective referencing. This blatant disparity raises serious questions about his integrity and the soundness of his overall approach, which appears to contradict the principles of Sunnah.

Clarifying Adnan's Position

I'm now intently analyzing Adnan's use of specific fatwas to justify acting. While I found fatwas from prominent scholars seemingly supporting this, a deeper dive into the context reveals discrepancies. The direct quotes and the accompanying context, and an emphasis on proper communication with donors is paramount. This raises crucial questions about whether or not Adnan's practice aligns with the spirit of the fatwas. This appears to be hypocritical.

Clarifying Donations' Purpose

I'm now grappling with the implications of misusing donated funds, specifically concerning Adnan's activities and comparing the practice of requesting donations for specific needs and then diverting them to other purposes. I'm focusing on the ethical and Islamic principle of seeking donor consent, as highlighted by Sheikh Ibn 'Uthaymin's ruling on the necessity of permission for reallocating surplus donations. This directly impacts the question of Adnan’s activities and the misallocation of funds for “buffets,” “elections,” and other unrelated events.

Reassessing Justifications

I'm now zeroing in on Adnan's justification of acting, which I had believed to be partially supported by scholar fatwas. However, further investigation reveals key conditions often overlooked. My focus is on the discrepancy between the conditions presented by scholars, and how Adnan implements this in the real world. This requires a deeper dive into the context surrounding these permissions, especially in light of the new information and evidence. I must now reassess the validity of this line of reasoning.

Evaluating Fatwa Application

I'm presently focusing on how the fatwa regarding "Parliament" is being misused. My analysis centers on the misuse of Sheikh Ibn 'Uthaymin's fatwa, which was meant to be used with strict regulations. The "Parliament" fatwa is being misinterpreted and applied inappropriately, which is concerning. The fatwa from the Sheikh is not what is being put forth. I'm investigating how this misapplication is happening in relation to Adnan's practice.

Assessing Adnan's Hypocrisy

I'm now intently analyzing the recent developments, particularly Adnan's activities which seem to directly contradict his stated principles. His claim to permissible acting, supposedly backed by scholarly opinions, appears questionable when examined more closely. The recent discovery of his alleged deception of donations, combined with selective interpretation, is deeply concerning. The situation is becoming quite complex.

Discerning the Nuances

I'm now diving into the details of permitted nasheeds, as articulated by Ibn Uthaymin. While recognizing the potential for fitna, I'm carefully analyzing the conditions set: no musical instruments, no base melodies, and no enticing voices. I'm focusing on these specifics.

Examining Nasheeds' Restrictions

I'm now analyzing the permissible conditions for nasheeds, as outlined by Ibn Uthaymin. I'm focusing on his stipulation against musical instruments and enticing voices. I am now exploring whether certain nasheeds, like "Illa Salati," comply with these requirements, or violate them. The context provided is crucial for understanding the implications.

Addressing the Concerns

I'm now grappling with Adnan's recent actions, considering their potential impact on my prior assessments. I'm scrutinizing his participation with women in a nasheed video, even though Ibn Uthaymin's ruling forbids enticing voices. I'm focusing on his adherence to the established parameters. The contradiction seems blatant.

Addressing the Queries

I'm now clarifying the ambiguities in the dialogue. The phrase "Hal fi Allah?" appears twice, and both instances, I believe, are mistranslated questions about Allah's existence, so I am translating them as such. I'm focusing on the implied meaning and potential typo that creates this odd phrase, seeking to understand the context of the questions. The phrase will now be clarified with an accurate translation.

Clarifying the Ambiguity

I'm now clarifying the ambiguities in the dialogue. The phrase "Hal fi Allah?" appears twice, and both instances, I believe, are mistranslated questions about Allah's existence, so I am translating them as such. I'm focusing on the implied meaning and potential typo that creates this odd phrase, seeking to understand the context of the questions. The phrase will now be clarified with an accurate translation.

I'm currently focused on the source material's origin. Understanding the nature of Salim al-Tawil's Fatawa and articles is crucial for proper translation. The objective remains clear: to produce a polished English translation, akin to professional work, ensuring the core message stays intact during translation.

Establishing Translation Standards

I've been solidifying the translation guidelines. Accuracy is paramount, leaning towards literalism unless contextual clarity demands otherwise. I'm prioritizing key Islamic terminologies, ensuring proper formatting with plain text and meticulous preservation of IDs and narrator chains. "Allah" will replace "God," and critical review will involve three passes. Note: I will not uppercase chapter headings, and Arabic script will only include the ﷺ symbol.

Investigating Salaf Perspectives

I'm now delving into the author's critique, specifically regarding Adnan Abdul Qadir's stance on Maqamat. The focus is on the distinction between natural expression of emotion in recitation (permitted, seen in Abu Musa al-Ash'ari) and artificial, learned melodic techniques, which are disliked by the Salaf. I need to understand Ibn al-Qayyim's related technical discussions to refine my understanding.

Examining Prophetic Traditions

I'm now focusing on the Prophet's hadith regarding melodic recitation. Clarifying the difference between natural melody and manufactured techniques is key. I'm referencing Zad al-Ma'ad to solidify this distinction. I also need to understand the closing to Adnan's section and the transition to the new article on speaking without knowledge.

Deciphering Quranic Sins

I'm now deep in Surah Al-A'raf, verse 33. I've dissected the verse's core sins: fawahish, ithm, baghy, shirk, and the gravest, speaking about Allah without knowledge. My current focus is unpacking the diverse expressions of this last sin, from theological errors like denying Allah's attributes or decree, to practical issues such as ruling outside of Divine law and making tahlil and tahrim without authority. I'm keen on grasping the escalating severity of these transgressions.

Clarifying Theological Nuances

I'm now diving into the implications of speaking about Allah without knowledge, exploring its manifestations and consequences. Specifically, I'm examining false claims of revelation and the pitfalls of bid'ah (innovation). I'm also grappling with the gravity of misinterpretations of the Divine law, drawing from warnings and prophetic traditions. The discussion on perfection of the religion further solidifies this point.

Evaluating Religious Sufficiency

I'm presently examining Ibn Kathir's commentary on the verse of religious perfection. I'm focusing on key hadiths and narrations, including the exchanges between Umar and a Jew, Ibn Abbas's response, and Abu Dharr's account of the Prophet's comprehensive guidance. Al-Irbad b. Sariyah's "White Path" hadith is crucial as well, alongside Abu Hurayrah's mention of leaving behind two things. The conclusion underlines our reliance on the Sunnah, rejecting theological rhetoric, innovations, and imported ideologies.

Addressing Prophetic Guidance

My current focus involves the Prophet's ﷺ teaching on using invented stories or dreams to encourage repentance. My analysis centers on the principle that if such methods held genuine merit, the Prophet ﷺ would have incorporated them. The underlying legal maxim suggests that in the absence of prescribed practices, the harm of such innovations outweighs any perceived benefit, reinforcing the need to base acts of worship on established commandments.

Reviewing Transliteration Protocols

I'm now revising my transliteration process, ensuring ALA-LC compliance for narrator names within chains, while the text itself retains original spellings. For example, "Adnan" and "Ibn al-Qayyim" stay as is, but narrators such as Ṭāriq ibn Shihāb and ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb will adhere to ALA-LC. I'm also reviewing Islamic terminology, defining key terms such as maqamat, tatrib, taghanni, khawarij, kalam, and watin, to ensure consistency throughout the work.

Polishing the Translation

I'm presently focused on the final phase of refinement. I'm focusing on "Ninth Alert" terminology, ensuring verse translations adhere closely to the tafsir's context. I must precisely convey the "bird flapping wings" hadith and accurately denote "Prohibited listening." Further, I'm clarifying Ibn al-Qayyim's complex "Two Faces" distinction regarding recitation, emphasizing the nuances between natural and artificial expressions. Throughout this process, I'll meticulously check the transliteration, formatting, and terminologies.

Revising Metaphorical Translations

I'm now revising the translation of the "nose-led camel" metaphor. After thorough analysis of the Arabic and context, I've confirmed al-Anuf, not al-Anif. The image represents a camel that is easily led because of the pain from its nose ring. My goal is to capture the essence of this image within the translation accurately, conveying the submissive nature of the camel. The focus now is precision: clarifying that the camel is easily led due to the pain if it resists.

I've been meticulously analyzing the user's request, focusing on identifying the critical elements. My assessment highlights the need to understand the user's role and the specific type of content involved. The focus is to grasp the nuance of the request.

Refining Translation Parameters

I'm currently engaged in refining the translation protocols, particularly regarding terminology. I've pinpointed key areas: Aqeedah, Manhaj, Hadith sciences, and Jarh wa Ta'dil. My primary goal is accuracy, with a preference for literal translation unless context mandates otherwise. I'm also meticulously adhering to specific formatting guidelines, including the use of plain text and ALA-LC transliteration for narrator names within chains.

Addressing Critical Concerns

I'm now grappling with the core questions posed about Jihad and legitimate authority. I am focusing on the scenario of a youth inquiring with Dr. Al-Khatib, exploring whether a contemporary ruler truly upholds and understands Jihad. The implications of Dr. Al-Khatib's answer—whether a ruler exists or not—are significant, potentially leading to the justification of Jihad without permission if no legitimate ruler is identified. I am carefully considering the potential dangers of distortions and corruption in the name of Jihad, and the ramifications for those who dismiss or misrepresent it.

Analyzing Potential Risks

I'm now zeroing in on the crucial phrases and their implications. I've noted that yuqirru bihi necessitates translation as "approves of it" or "acknowledges it," while yu'ayyinuhu should be "identify him." I'm carefully reviewing the provided excerpts for accuracy.

I've moved on to solidify the translation style, prioritizing accuracy and literal renderings unless the meaning is at stake. Islamic terminology will be handled with precision, and I'm ensuring the strict application of specific transliteration rules, particularly for narrator names within chains of narration, per the instructions. The preference is for a clean, plain-text output, and I am meticulous about preserving identifiers throughout.

Formulating the Rebuttal

I'm now deep into the argument. P32a dissects verses, focusing on accurate Quranic renderings and the 'hasr' concept. I'm aiming for clarity in English grammar while maintaining the original argument's nuances. P32b presents a rebuttal. I'm carefully translating 'nur' vs 'tin', the concepts of ghuluw and rububiyyah, and the reference to Sufi beliefs. I'm focusing on the technical terminology.

Analyzing Further Arguments

I'm now breaking down P32c, looking at the comparison to the created Quran, and referencing key figures and groups such as Imam Ahmad and the Jahmiyyah. Translating "Ta'til" and "Fitnah" accurately is paramount. P32d is next, the article's conclusion and a reference to Dr. Sabri Al-Demerdash. I'm moving on to P33, starting a new fatwa, translating the standard opening with precision. Finally, I'm at P33a, regarding imitating Jews and Christians, particularly Christmas, with a focus on the relevant Hadith.

Exploring Nuances Further

I'm now fully immersed in P33b through P34c. I'm carefully translating references to scholarly works, particularly Ibn Taymiyyah's and Ibn al-Qayyim's writings on imitation. I'm focusing on the actual text of Ibn Uthaymin's fatwa regarding Christmas and New Year's, translating rulings against greetings, attendance, and gift-giving. I've noted the strong condemnation from Ibn al-Qayyim, who considers this action worse than consuming alcohol. The introduction to Tawhid and the last ten days of Ramadan is also noted. I'm now transitioning to the intricacies of Tawhid itself, focusing on the verses and terminology, like 'taghut', discussed in P34a. I'm now defining shirk in P34b and P34c, particularly the concept of no difference in worshipping any being other than Allah.

Reflecting on P34d-P35c

I've just finalized the translation of P34d, focusing on the origins of shirk, the idols, and the vital Hadith about avoiding idol worship. P34e concluded the section, and now I'm immersed in P35, starting with the open letter to a professor regarding Jama'at al-Tabligh. I'm carefully translating the criticisms of their methods, particularly the mixing of truth and falsehood, and the emphasis on bid'ah and ghibah. I'm now at the nuances within P35b and P35c.

Analyzing Doctor's Khutbah

I'm now delving into the critique of the Khutbah, focusing on the discussion of Jihad. I'm carefully translating the distinctions between Jihad al-Daf' and Jihad al-Talab, and critically examining the Doctor's confusing statements regarding permission requirements. The potentially dangerous implications of his claims about authority are the key here.

Finalizing Terminology and Names

I'm now completing the final checks, focusing on the refined technical terms and consistent transliteration, especially with names within narrations. I've double-checked "hasr," "taqfu," "sunan," "taghut," and "dhat anwat" for accuracy. I'm also ensuring the correct application of ALA-LC in narrator chains. I'm now fully prepared to finalize the text.

Addressing Key Errors

I'm now implementing the corrections and refinements. Regarding narrator names, I'm checking transliterations, focusing on Abū Sa'īd, Aḥmad (Musnad), and Muḥammad ibn Ṣāliḥ al-'Uthaymīn for ALA-LC compliance, while maintaining plain spelling for clarity elsewhere. I'm also ensuring the correct interpretation of the Arabic grammar in P32a and clarifying the distinction in P33c. The accurate translation of "khurooj" and the accurate rendering of the doctor's error in P36 are also underway.

I've been meticulously analyzing the user's initial request. I'm focusing intently on defining the precise role needed - a professional Arabic to English translator who is an expert in Islamic content. Understanding the nuances here is crucial for accurate translation and will inform the direction of my next steps. This foundational analysis helps ensure I'm aligned with the core task.

Detailing Translation Strategy

I'm now fully immersed in the specifics. The source material is Fatawa and articles from Salim al-Tawil. I'm prioritizing accuracy by leaning towards literal translation. Islamic technical terms will be strictly adhered to, with a three-pass review process for quality control, covering structure, context, and transliteration. The translation of specific terms are noted. I am keeping strict adherence to formatting requirements.

Interpreting Specific Terms

I'm now clarifying the meaning of "Sahih" in Hadith science as authentic. I've also parsed P28b, focusing on the Arabic text and its context discussing Bid'ah. Key terms like Bid'ah, Shirk, and Muhdathat are getting special attention. I'm carefully translating the Arabic text, including the phrase "الدليل غير صريح..." as "The evidence is not explicit".

Dissecting Bid'ah and Tawqifi

I'm now focusing on Bid'ah and its relationship with Shirk. The text highlights Bid'ah's link to innovation and deviation from the Prophet's teachings, drawing on the Hadith of Jābir. I'm also analyzing Sufyān al-Thawrī's quote regarding Bid'ah being more beloved to Iblīs than disobedience. Finally, I've begun parsing P28c and its focus on the concept of Tawqifi in worship.

Defining Innovative Practices

I am now thoroughly analyzing the concept of Bid'ah, specifically focusing on how to refute it. I'm focusing on the burden of proof, emphasizing that innovators must provide evidence for their practices, not the Sunnis. I've noted the Hadith on innovation and misguidance, also the saying of the Prophet.

Addressing Inventions and Innovations

I'm now critically examining the concept of Bid'ah, specifically focusing on the rejection of innovations within the faith, using the Hadith's rejection of introducing matters not ordained by Islam. This includes the invalidation of any practice that contradicts established Islamic law. The text directly challenges innovators who claim permissibility for invented formulas, emphasizing the Prophet's prohibition of such actions, and the completion of Islam. I am now examining P28d regarding the Mawlid, the Prophet's birthday.

Evaluating the Evidence

Currently, I'm carefully analyzing the innovator's claim regarding evidence for celebrating the Prophet's birthday. I find it significant that the innovator can't produce any actual proof, merely asserting abundance. The contrast with Allah's clear evidence for His Oneness and the Prophets' truthfulness is striking. I'm focusing on the nature of this unsupported assertion, its implications, and how it aligns with the overall argument against Bid'ah. The innovator's reliance on claims is the key to focus on, and this line of reasoning is being examined.

Identifying Weak Arguments

The focus is now sharpening on the methods employed by innovators. I'm carefully scrutinizing the weak evidence often used. The specifics like Mawdu' (fabricated), Munqati' (disconnected), Wahiyah (flimsy), and Da'if (weak) are key. I'm drafting a section explaining how these arguments are used. It's becoming clear that the core strategy involves presenting unverified information.

Identifying Deceptive Methods

I'm now zeroing in on the third and most dangerous cause for misguidance: misinterpreting authentic evidence. I'm noting the general tendency, across humanity and Jinn, to twist clear texts, giving rise to innovations. This "reasoning with authentic evidence" tactic is central, and its deceptive nature is becoming clearer.

Clarifying Misguided Pretexts

I'm now analyzing the common pretexts used for deviation. It's striking how "love for the righteous" leads to idolatry, "venerating the Ahl al-Bayt" results in inflated beliefs, and "remembrance of Allah" justifies innovations like Mawlids. "Jihad" becomes bloodshed, "denying God's attributes" diminishes Him, and "jealousy for religion" causes division. The pattern of distorted justifications is becoming very clear.

Analyzing Faulty Reasoning

I'm now fully immersed in the core issue. I'm focusing on the deceptive reasoning that leads to innovation. The innovators' use of absolute, ambiguous, and general evidence, and comparing our legislation to previous ones is the key focus. I'm particularly struck by how Iblis's logic mirrors that of the polytheists, twisting truth into falsehood. I am dissecting these flawed comparisons that pave the path to deviation, showing the contrast between truth and faulty comparisons.

Deconstructing False Claims

I'm now fully dissecting the core argument, focusing on the insidious use of flawed logic. I'm noting the parallel between the polytheists' claim and the innovator's tactics. Both intertwine truth and falsehood, manipulating religious texts. This strategy, similar to the cheating merchant's deceptive practices, is now clear. I'm focusing on how this obfuscation leads to innovation.

Deconstructing the Deceiver

I'm now fully immersed in the core argument, focusing on the deceptive tactics. The inherent manipulation of religious texts by innovators is striking and mirroring deceptive merchants' practices. This obfuscation is the catalyst for innovation and must be addressed. I am now deconstructing the inherent flaws in their deceptive logic. I can clearly see how the innovator weaves truth and falsehood, mirroring the polytheists' claims. I'm focusing now on the essence of their deception.

Examining Final Conclusions

I'm now fully immersed in the concluding section. I've translated the final remarks, highlighting the core takeaway: the innovators' deviation stems from a lack of, invalid, or misapplied evidence. I've noted the plea for steadfastness in the face of innovation. Additionally, I am now translating P29. My focus is on the context of concealing sins and its associated Hadith citations.

Interpreting Concealment's Importance

I'm now fully immersed in the translated text, focusing on the emphasis placed on the concealment of sins. I've noted the verses from An-Nur and An-Nisa', along with the Hadith from Muslim, which underscore the importance of this practice. The inherent connection between Allah's love for concealment and its subsequent encouragement is evident. I am exploring the profound implications of this teaching.

Evaluating Concealment Narratives

Now, I'm examining the translated text on concealment, particularly the Hadith narrated by Ibn Mas'ud regarding the man's interaction with a woman. I'm noting Umar's response, "Allah had concealed him if he had concealed himself," highlighting the importance of discretion. The Prophet's response and subsequent call back is of crucial significance. I'm also focusing on the implications of the narratives.

Deciphering Key Hadith

Now, I'm analyzing the translated Hadith focusing on concealment's significance. I'm carefully reviewing the exchange between Umar and the Prophet, noting the importance of Allah's concealment. I'm focusing on the Prophet's affirmation. This highlights a critical principle in Islamic practice. The implications for ethical conduct are profound and are being thoroughly considered.

Clarifying the Mujāhirūn

I'm now zeroing in on the concept of the Mujāhirūn, those who publicize their sins, as highlighted in the Hadith. The distinction between Allah's concealment and self-exposure is crucial. The impact of such actions, especially via media, is under review, focusing on the insidious role of Satan and the loss of Allah's protective concealment. I'm focusing on the nature and consequence of the disclosure.

Evaluating Sin Exposure

I'm now analyzing the implications of the "Repentant Artist" label. The contradiction is striking: if one is repentant, they've abandoned the sin, making the title redundant and potentially misleading. I am examining how such titles undermine the act of repentance and its true meaning. The inherent contradiction between repentance and the continued public association with the sin itself requires detailed examination.

Assessing Repentance's Implications

I'm now fully immersed in the heart of the matter. The core focus is on the hypocrisy of labeling someone with their past sins while claiming repentance. The text critiques this contradiction, highlighting the need to abandon such labels and seek Allah's concealment. I am carefully translating and analyzing how this undermines the essence of genuine repentance.

Assessing the Critic's Perspective

I'm now fully immersed in the critical perspective. I'm focusing on the blame placed not just on those labeled as "repentant", but also on the hosts who publicize their past transgressions. The emphasis on concealing sins rather than exposing them before the people is the primary focus. I'm noting the concern about the impact on society and the call for greater discretion in the handling of repentant individuals.

Dissecting Critical Commentary

I'm now deeply analyzing the recent criticism. The text's strong condemnation of publicizing repentance, especially targeting female callers, is evident. The critique questions the motives of those involved, highlighting potential exploitation and deception. I'm focusing on the call for adherence to Islamic principles of concealment and the warning against methodological deviations that could lead to broader societal corruption. The responsibility felt by the writer to warn the public is significant, and I'm carefully evaluating the reasoning presented.

Revising Critical Analysis

Now I'm deep into the text, specifically the implications of the "Repentant Artist" label. It's now becoming clear that the label itself is fundamentally problematic. The text highlights that it contradicts the essence of repentance, which is a sincere abandonment of past sins. The focus is now shifting to how this label undermines the concept of Allah's concealment and promotes public exposure rather than discretion. I am carefully translating and analyzing this point.

Evaluating Criticisms' Merits

I'm now focusing on the implications of a specific critique. The critique suggests people prefer those without a past, highlighting the hypocrisy. I'm noting the problematic trend of some seeking fame through "repentance," even if it lacks true sincerity. I am examining how this approach contradicts Islamic teachings on genuine repentance, especially the call for discretion, which is central.

Addressing Lesson-Seeking Arguments

I am now thoroughly engaged with the arguments against drawing lessons from exposed sins. I've translated and analyzed the text's critique of using individuals' past transgressions as public lessons, noting the emphasis on concealing faults. The call for sincere repentance and avoiding the exploitation of past sins is central. I'm focusing on the Hadith's wisdom regarding concealment and its implications for ethical conduct.

Revising Ruqyah Fraud Draft

I'm now revising the draft focusing on fraudulent Ruqyah. I'm highlighting the exploitation of vulnerable individuals by those claiming to be legitimate healers. Their superficial diagnoses and pre-packaged answers are now the key focus. I'm aiming to expose their methods and emphasize the importance of discernment in seeking legitimate treatment, referencing the Hadith. I'm emphasizing the need for authentic Ruqyah based on the Quran and Sunnah.

Evaluating Ruqyah's Core Beliefs

I'm now revising the draft on fraudulent Ruqyah, and I am now concentrating on establishing the core Islamic belief: Allah is the sole healer. I'm noting the verses from Ash-Shu'ara' and the Hadith emphasizing the Prophet's supplication. It's becoming evident that many have forgotten this truth, relying excessively on means rather than their creator. The focus is to re-establish the correct understanding to counter fraudulent claims.

Illustrating Misguided Practices

I'm now zeroing in on the exploitation within Ruqyah. The text details how desperate individuals, particularly women, will go to extreme lengths, even compromising their faith and privacy, in pursuit of a cure or marriage. This uncovers the widespread reliance on unauthorized means, including polytheistic practices. The inherent danger of this misguidance is becoming clearer.

Analyzing Deceptive Practices

I am now fully immersed in the fraudulent practices of some "Ruqyah" healers. I've noted the disturbing exploitation, especially of vulnerable women, and the financial and moral transgressions, even recording them. The reliance on this is a dangerous path. The Prophet's words and these actions contrast sharply.

Evaluating Patient Exploitation

I'm now fully immersed in the section on Ruqyah exploitation. The key point I am noting is the focus on the question of exploiting vulnerable patients, and that is a key focus. The text emphasizes that their actions, such as seeking a cure or a marriage, must be questioned. Their filming is not hidden. I am now translating this portion.

Evaluating Divine Reliance

I'm now analyzing the Islamic concept of divine reliance within the context of Ruqyah. Key verses from Al-Baqarah and An-Naml, and the Hadith emphasizing Prophet's teachings, highlight that Allah is the ultimate healer. I'm focusing on those who do not seek Ruqyah, aligning with the concept of relying solely on Allah for healing. This highlights the dangers of relying on external sources.

Defining Disease Origins

Now, I'm analyzing the text's connection between sin and illness. The emphasis on disobedience as a primary source of disease, as stated in P30d, is striking. I'm noting the common lack of Quranic engagement until trials arise. The focus on this connection is clear.

Evaluating Disease Causes

I'm now clarifying the link between sin and vulnerability to spiritual harm. The text highlights how indulging in forbidden activities, such as music, drugs, and images, opens one up to Jinn and devils. This emphasizes the importance of dhikr and prostration for protection, and the consequences of neglecting these practices. I'm focusing on the interconnectedness of spiritual well-being and moral conduct.

Summarizing Self-Help Guidance

I'm now fully immersed in the practical advice. I'm focusing on the steps for self-protection against spiritual harm. Recitation of the Mu‘awwidhatayn, Āyat al-Kursī, and the last two verses of Sūrah Al-Baqarah are key, alongside regular Adhkār. I've noted the emphasis on individual reliance on Allah and the potential for avoiding external healers. This self-reliance emphasis is a key focus.

Evaluating Healing Patience

I'm now focusing on a key section on patience amidst trials, and how it is essential for healing. The text highlights that these trials are part of Allah's sunnah. The text is emphasizing verses from Surah Al-Mulk, stressing patience in overcoming trials. The verses and Hadiths provide context. Healing is a gradual process and the emphasis on the Mu'awwidhat and Adhkar for healing is evident.

Summarizing Self-Reliance

I'm now zeroing in on self-reliance in healing. The text encourages seeking refuge in Allah, emphasizing the importance of reading Surah Al-Baqarah, not just listening. I'm noting the refutation of specific practices without evidence. The goal is to correct misconceptions and reinforce genuine reliance.

Evaluating Practitioners' Motives

I'm now analyzing the motivations of Ruqyah practitioners. I've translated and assessed the text's critique of their motivations and the potential for exploitation within this field, and the emphasis on financial gain rather than genuine care. The text is urging readers to exercise discernment when seeking help.

Analyzing Healer Conduct

I'm now fully immersed in the core argument, focusing on the healer's fallibility. I'm noting the initial good intentions that often deteriorate into greed and illicit actions. The contrast between genuine Ruqyah and the pursuit of wealth and forbidden desires is stark, as I analyze the healer's transition from sincerity to exploitation. This analysis highlights a common pitfall.

Examining Exploitative Practices

I am now thoroughly analyzing the exploitative practices within Ruqyah, particularly the financial and emotional manipulation of patients. The text suggests that people must be careful from healers, as it is a field of tests. I am carefully translating the text. The question of whether healers are driven by genuine care or financial gain is central. This section is a key focus.

Comparing Current Practices

I'm now comparing contemporary practices to the Companions' actions, specifically concerning Ruqyah. The key contrast is that Companions only received payment after a successful outcome, whereas modern practitioners often demand fees upfront, even before the process begins. I am also making note of the sale of pre-charged items.

Revising Clinic Critique

I am now thoroughly analyzing the concerns about the specialized Ruqyah clinics. The text highlights the problematic nature of charging upfront fees, which seems inconsistent with earlier practices. I am noting the implication that the practice is becoming commercialized. The key focus is on analyzing the critiques of the clinics. I am now translating this portion.

Evaluating Practitioners' Greed

I am now thoroughly immersed in the text's critical perspective on commercialized Ruqyah. I note the critique of upfront fees and the commercialization of this practice, contrasting it with the Salaf. I am now focusing on the danger of Ruqyah clinics and the potential for exploitation within this field. I'm carefully translating and analyzing the concerns.

Evaluating Exploitative Claims

I'm currently delving into the specifics of Ruqyah fraud, examining how practitioners twist Hadith to justify charging exorbitant fees. The text highlights a troubling trend where claims of "special" Quranic verses are used to manipulate patients, emphasizing the need for critical assessment. This manipulation is now the primary concern.

Addressing Modern Ruqyah

I'm now comparing contemporary practices to the Prophetic era. The key contrast is payment post-cure, unlike upfront fees. This commercialization raises concern about sincerity, which is now central.

Deconstructing Satan's Influence

I'm now fully immersed in the translated text, focusing on the interpretation of verse 3:175 and Satan's influence. I'm noting how Satan frightens believers with his allies, and the importance of fearing Allah alone. I'm analyzing the two interpretations presented, drawing on Ibn Kathir's commentary. This foundational understanding is crucial for subsequent analysis.

Deconstructing Fearmongering

I'm now closely analyzing the concept of fearmongering, focusing on how Satan uses it to manipulate believers. I'm noting two interpretations of verse 3:175 and Ibn Kathir's commentary. Understanding the devil's authority over his allies and the believers' obligation to fear only Allah is central to my analysis. The deceptive nature of fear-based manipulation is the focus.

Evaluating Divine Fearlessness

I'm now fully immersed in the heart of the matter. I am focusing on the distinction between succumbing to Satan's influence and the believers' resolute reliance on Allah, drawing parallels with Prophet Ibrahim's unwavering stance in the face of his people's arguments. This contrast between fearful association and firm devotion is the key.

Revising Divine Security

I'm now revising the translation and analysis of the verses focusing on Allah's protection. The text discusses security for believers, contrasting this with the polytheists' fear-based practices, and drawing parallels between Ibrahim's stance and the believer's reliance on Allah. The goal is to highlight the importance of not succumbing to intimidation and the essential nature of unwavering faith.

Deconstructing Innovator Deception

I'm now fully immersed in the text, scrutinizing the innovators' deceptive claims. It's becoming evident that their tactics closely mirror those of the polytheists, twisting religious texts to justify innovations, all while claiming veneration. I am now examining how this deception undermines Islamic principles. The innovator claims that innovations are better than the Sunnah. I will deconstruct that specific fallacy now.

Deconstructing Deceptive Claims

Now, I'm fully dissecting the innovator's tactics. I'm noting the dishonest attempts to silence critics. Their manipulative strategies mirror polytheists. Their fabricated claims of Shaykh Bāz's will are key. The inherent flaw is that these methods undermine the Sunnah.

Addressing Ghazali's Critique

I'm now fully immersed in the critique of Al-Ghazali's Ihya. I am clarifying the innovator's tactics in silencing critics by claiming dire consequences, thus frightening the people of the Sunnah. I am preparing a critique of the book. I am translating and analyzing this portion now.

Revising Critical Analysis

Now I'm fully engaged in examining the critique of Dr. Damardāsh's claims. The key issue is the repeated transmission of his statements on the radio. His claims about the Prophet's creation and light contrast with the Sunnah. I am assessing the need for correction, and analyzing the arguments and refutations of these claims. This forms a foundation for the following.

I'm currently focused on the initial analysis of the translation request. I've pinpointed the key aspects: the translator's role, the specific source material (Fatawa from Salim al-Tawil's site), and the need for precision with Islamic content. This crucial step informs the subsequent phases of language selection, cultural nuance interpretation, and appropriate register for the final product.

Developing the Style Guide

I'm now fully immersed in developing the detailed style guide. I've solidified the accuracy-first translation approach, noting exceptions. I'm carefully documenting the rules for technical terminology, like the specific Islamic sciences, and I've detailed the formatting requirements, including the use of ALA-LC, the translation of Arabic phrases, and the proper handling of "Allah". The translation process will involve three key revision passes, ensuring alignment, contextual accuracy, and precise transliteration.

Defining Key Terminology

I'm presently working on the crucial terminology, focusing specifically on how to render certain Islamic concepts accurately. The supplication now reads: "May Allah send Salah, Salam, and Barakah upon our Prophet Muhammad..." I'm also considering the best approach for the heading, sub-heading, and question regarding fasting, aiming for clarity and precision.

Elaborating on Fasting

I'm presently focusing on the nuances of fasting. I've now defined the rulings for accidental eating or drinking: the fast remains valid, requiring no makeup or atonement. I've also addressed the situations of the sick and travelers, clarifying that temporary sickness requires making up fasts, while permanent inability necessitates feeding the poor. The menstruating woman's exemption from prayer and fasting has been detailed, along with permissible actions during her period.

Clarifying Ramadan Activities

I'm currently delving into the specifics of Ramadan practices. I've now clarified the rewards of acts like fasting, night prayer, Quran recitation, and I'tikaf. I've also defined the consequences of intentionally breaking a fast without a valid excuse, including the requirement for sincere repentance and, if applicable, the severe expiation. I'm also addressing the permissibility of watching TV series during this time, focusing on how it impacts the purpose of fasting. Lastly, I'm considering the virtue of performing Umrah during Ramadan.

Examining Qunut & Gerga'oon

I've been examining the specifics of Qunut and Gerga'oon. Regarding Qunut, I've confirmed its legitimacy with the translation of the Prophet's supplication, and I've addressed the problematic aspects: stretching, rhyming, and any insincerity. I'm now fully focused on Gerga'oon. I've analyzed its historical roots, tracing it to a mid-Ramadan Gulf celebration with Persian influences, and I've confirmed that it lacks any basis in Islamic tradition. I've also detailed the Standing Committee's pronouncement against it as a Bid'ah.

Assessing the Bid'ah

I'm now analyzing the Gerga'oon from the perspective of its bid'ah status. I've re-examined the Fatwa's core argument: festivals are replaced by Allah, and Gerga'oon, a mid-Ramadan celebration, is not worship but has become a symbolic event. I'm focusing on the Hadith from Anas, which clarifies annual celebrations evolving into Eid, a Shari'ah concept. I'm examining this in relation to Gerga'oon's extravagant practices and potential for israf in the celebration.

Dissecting the Command

I'm now fully immersed in examining the "changing the evil" imperative. I've broken down each aspect: the requirement of knowledge before action, the nuances of "sees" versus "thinks," and the breadth of "munkaran." I'm also carefully considering the obligation and its limitations: the necessity of ability, the contextual nature of "by his hand," and the avoidance of worsening the situation.

Finalizing the Analysis

I'm now concluding the analysis, focusing on the appropriate response to the concept of "changing the evil". I've distilled the requirements: knowledge, clear explanation (not just shouting), and consistent action, even if the person making the correction has personal faults. I'm also carefully considering the importance of heart-based disapproval and separation from the evil, as well as the need for patience and the ethical considerations of judging others.

Analyzing the Deviation

I'm now analyzing the Tabligh movement's practices, considering their leadership and beliefs. I've noted the reliance on potentially unreliable sources, their suspicious leadership structure requiring allegiance, and the annual gathering in Bangladesh, which is argued to resemble Hajj and thus constitutes a Bid'ah. I'm also contrasting Bid'ah with sin, highlighting its severity based on scriptural evidence.

Assessing Tabligh's Priorities

I'm now deep in evaluating the Tabligh movement. I'm carefully scrutinizing their prioritization of the Bangladesh gathering over Hajj, noting their elevation of Da'wah (perceived as better) and their dismissive approach to Hajj. I'm comparing it to the Prophet's ﷺ emphasis on knowledge and I'tikaf in the Masjid. I'm also investigating their dubious practices and exaggerated claims regarding attendee numbers.

Interpreting Polytheism

I'm currently delving into the concept of polytheism, considering the nuances beyond idol worship. I'm noting the early polytheists' worship of Allah alongside partners, as well as the importance of Surah Al-Kafirun as a declaration of disavowal. I'm now cataloging the Hadiths emphasizing the virtues of the Surah, including its equivalence to a quarter of the Quran.

Discerning Kafir & Shirk

My current focus is on the specific verses related to disbelief and polytheism. I've now clarified that the term "Kafir" is applicable to anyone not adhering purely to Islam. I'm carefully examining the meaning of "I do not worship what you worship," particularly its implications for tolerance versus disavowal. The concept of "Unity of Religions" is definitively false, and repetition of the verse emphasizes Tawhid.

Addressing Hypocrisy's Shadows

I'm now fully immersed in the poignant exploration of hypocrisy, specifically the act of condemning others for flaws we ourselves harbor. The situation mirrors that of Pharaoh's accusation of corruption against Musa, and it echoes the poetry that illustrates a doctor teaching medicine while ill. I'm carefully analyzing verse Al-Baqarah:44. I'm focusing on the Hadith of Descent, clarifying that Ahl al-Sunnah accepts it as is, without distortion or denial, and addressing the erroneous claims of Dr. Khalid.

Examining Hadith Deviations

I'm now zeroing in on the problematic Hadith. I've broken down their deceptive methodology, contrasting their denial of attributes with a more forthright rejection. I've noted their reliance on "Ta'wil" and its deeper implications. I'm also carefully examining the root cause of their deviation: comparing the Creator to creation.

Evaluating the Accuracy

I'm now meticulously scrutinizing the accuracy of my work, carefully examining the transliteration and translation of names. I'm ensuring consistency with established scholarly practices, like in the cases of Sufyān al-Thawrī and Abū al-Aswad al-Du'alī. I'm also ensuring the proper use of Islamic honorifics, as well as preserving the theological arguments.

Perfecting the Transcription

Currently, I'm performing comprehensive self-corrections and refinements. I've pinpointed specific terminology, like "Kaffarah Mughallazah" to "Severe expiation" and "Imsak" to "Refraining." I'm also ensuring the correct transliteration of names and titles like Abū Saʻīd al-Khuḍrī and al-Albānī. Plus, I'm checking the proper handling of honorifics, as well as preserving the theological arguments. I'm focusing on smooth English flow while maintaining the Salafi schematic.
I've begun dissecting the request, focusing on the translator's role and the source material – Salim al-Tawil's Fatawa/articles. The objective is clear: produce a high-fidelity English translation suitable for expert consumption. This involves pinpointing the specific content parameters and translation method required to deliver a polished output.

Considering the Details

I'm now zeroing in on the finer points, prioritizing meticulous translation. I'm focusing on Islamic terminology, specifically Aqeedah, Manhaj, and Hadith sciences, and Jarh wa Ta'dil. The translation will be plain text, preserving full chains (Isnad). I'm carefully navigating conflicting instructions about formatting, ultimately adhering to the plain text preference.

Defining the Parameters

I've just refined the translation parameters. Narrator names will use ALA-LC transliteration exclusively. "God" is now consistently "Allah," except when ilah is relevant. I'm incorporating ﷺ for صلى الله عليه وسلم and excluding Arabic characters (except ﷺ) in the output. IDs will be preserved. I'm focusing on a three-pass internal revision, and emphasizing the crucial point: no all-caps chapter headings.

Expanding the Context

\n\nI'm now fully immersed in the nuances of the provided source material, concentrating on critical excerpts. Specifically, I'm working with Salim al-Tawil's Fatawa/articles on Uluw and Istiwa, referencing Ibn al-Qayyim and al-Baghawī. I'm carefully translating discussions about the deviant Mu'aṭṭilah and Jahmiyyah, working towards the plain text goal. I'm drafting text that will address the "Descent" (Nuzul) and maintaining consistency with previously decided terminology and style.

Exploring the Arguments

I'm now deeply analyzing the arguments presented, particularly the argument from hearing and the associated analogies regarding Allah's attributes. I've broken down the innovators' distortions of Nuzul, and have crafted a rebuttal based on logical reasoning and the refutation of the literal intent. I'm also examining the specific background of the individual being refuted, focusing on his tribal affiliation and the influence of a person driven by desires, as described on P64g, starting with the invocation "Brother reader...".

Investigating the Criticisms

I'm now deep into the critical refutation, focusing on the specific deviations of the individual being addressed. I've documented the criticisms regarding his stance on tawaf around graves, his admiration for Ibn 'Arabi, and his call for interfaith dialogue. I'm carefully drafting passages that will highlight these errors and contrast them with orthodox Islamic teachings, while maintaining a respectful tone. I'm also examining the implications of his statements about Ahl al-Bayt and ensuring that this gets recorded accurately.

Developing the Argument

I'm now focusing on a specific section discussing the believer's unwavering submission to Allah's rulings, drawing on verses like 51:56, 13:41, and 2:285. I'm crafting a concise articulation of this principle: "Allah the Exalted created us for His worship alone..." I'm then moving onto the excerpt on P65a, which emphasizes the believer's obedience. I'm carefully translating the comparison between the Sahabah and the Bani Israel, and highlighting the contrasting responses during the Battle of Al-Ahzab.

Refining the Approach

I'm presently focusing on the "Hadith of the sandals", detailing the Prophet's ﷺ action and the immediate obedience of the Sahabah. I'm noting the narrator chain from Abu Said al-Khudri, citing Abu Dawud and al-Albani's reference. This serves as a stark comparison to modern hesitations. I'm moving on to page 66, which introduces a critical refutation of a doctor of Shari'ah.

Evaluating the Refutations

I'm presently evaluating the specific refutations against the doctor of Shari'ah. I've translated details regarding the author's persistent attempts to meet, and the subsequent public call. I'm focusing on the ethical considerations of public criticism, and I've noted the author's use of indirect counsel. I've also incorporated the specific example of Sheikh Bin Baz's public naming and corrective action.

Expanding the Scope

I'm now integrating the provided Hadith into the broader argument. I've translated the author's comparison between the early Muslims' avoidance of markets and the current excessive indulgence. I've noted the author's emphasis on the societal impact, referencing scholarly commentary by Ibn Hajar and Al-Nawawi, and considering the implications of this modern consumerist behavior on religious and social interactions.

Assessing the Criticisms

I'm now grappling with the criticisms leveled against modern Da'wah practices, especially the incongruity of holding lectures within shopping malls. I've highlighted specific incidents and their implications. I'm carefully translating the concerns around mixing, inappropriate humor, and the potential for fitnah, referencing relevant hadiths. I'm focusing on the author's argument for proper settings, contrasting the seriousness of Da'wah with casual environments.

Clarifying the Focus

I'm presently focusing on the provided sources and content. I've begun to translate the section on the necessity of aligning politics with Sharia. I'm focusing on the excerpt from Ibn al-Qayyim, quoting Al-Shafi'i, and exploring the implications of their statements. I'm also carefully incorporating the relevant verses into my summary, and translating the closing dua. Finally, I'm noting the author's reaction to prior articles, and the subsequent threats.

Summarizing the Narrative

I'm presently focusing on the compelling stories of resilience and resistance. I've translated the citation from Ibn Muflih and the example of al-Harawī, noting the threats faced for refuting innovators. I'm also carefully incorporating the emotional context about the author's motivation, the sorrow driving him to continue. I'm analyzing the modern claims about Jihad and its specific justifications.

Revising Jihad's Nuances

I'm now deeply engaged with the subtleties of Jihad, particularly the essential distinctions. I'm focusing on the need for coordination in defensive actions, referencing treaties and weaknesses, and tailoring my translation to a general audience. The risk of youth misinterpreting occupations (Iraq/Afghanistan) is critical. I'm also addressing the hypocrisy of theorists who incite but disclaim responsibility.

Categorizing the Transliterations

I'm now fully immersed in the meticulous work of categorizing and transcribing names and terms. I'm actively integrating the complete list into the appropriate sections and confirming the transliterations, focusing on accuracy and consistency. I'm prioritizing the refinement of the names, ensuring adherence to the ALA-LC guidelines. I'm checking that the tone and overall presentation meet the high standards for a plain text, polished translation. I am now working on ensuring no markup is in the text.

I've initiated the analysis by clearly defining the scope. My current focus is on the specific role – a professional translator adept at Islamic content, particularly Salafi scholarship from Salim al-Tawil's Fatawa and articles. This initial step is pivotal for accuracy in this work.

Pinpointing the Nuances

I'm now zeroing in on the required translation style. It needs to be highly accurate and literal, but with flexibility for contextual meaning. Technical terminology like Aqeedah and Manhaj are being preserved, and I'm ensuring full narration chains remain intact. This includes careful use of ALA-LC for transliteration of narrator names only. I am also currently working on chapter headings, poetry and verses translations. I am also being very careful to replace "God" with "Allah" when applicable.

Clarifying Translation Intent

I realized an important discrepancy. The system instruction directed an Arabic response, but the user explicitly requested an English translation. In such translation tasks, the target language overrides any conflicting system instructions. I am proceeding with the English translation as requested.

\n\n

I've clarified the translation direction and re-focused on the user's intent to produce an English translation. I'm now in the midst of analyzing and translating a specific segment (P69d) regarding a discussion on "Theorist" and concepts like Jihad, Takfir of rulers, and key terms such as Imam, Hakim, and Wali al-Amr. I'm careful with these key religious terms, and am paying extra attention to accuracy.

Dissecting Religious Concepts

I'm now fully immersed in a dense passage dissecting the concepts of Jihad, Takfir, and leadership within Islamic thought. Key terms like Imam, Hakim, and Wali al-Amr are being critically analyzed to ensure a precise and nuanced translation that maintains the source's intent, particularly focusing on the nuanced theological arguments regarding Jihad and its implications. I am paying close attention to the specific questions posed to the theorist.

Translating Nuanced Arguments

I am currently working on this passage where the "Theorist" claims to not perform Takfir, and I am ensuring that the translation reflects the importance of clarity in religious pronouncements, as highlighted by the repeated statements of the Prophet ﷺ. Also, the poetry, the narrative about the Theorist and the Hadith of Utban bin Malik are carefully included in translation. I am now proceeding to accurately capture the specific exchange's core issues, including the explicit denial of Takfir, while maintaining the contextual references. I've standardized the ALA-LC for Anas ibn Mālik.

Composing a Preface

I'm presently translating the introduction to a Khutbah, including elements of Khutbat al-Hajah. The focus is on defining "Hizbullah" based on Surah Al-Mujadilah, incorporating verses 58:22, 60:4, and 47:7. I am drafting a standard opening, followed by verse translations and a brief excerpt from 58:22, maintaining the flow.

Analyzing Sectarianism

I am now carefully working on translating a section regarding sectarianism. I am analyzing the defense of the Sahaba, the warning against those who curse them, and the implications of this within the text. I am incorporating relevant verses, like 59:8-10 and 58:19. I am carefully translating the key phrase "Whoever the appearance of the Companions enrages is a Kafir." The translation reflects the critical analysis of the text.

Refining Sectarian Analysis

I'm now carefully translating a section focusing on sectarianism, differentiating between "ignorant commoners" and intellectuals. I'm clarifying the distinction between fitnah (strife) and the clarification of truth within the text. The concept of coexistence versus wala' is being carefully navigated, drawing comparisons to the coexistence of Jews in Madinah. The current focus is on a deeper understanding, as I continue translating the section. I am also currently working on a quote from Ibn al-Qayyim, and a related hadith.

Examining Jihad Types

I'm presently translating a section on diverse interpretations of Jihad, moving from traditional understandings to modern applications. I am incorporating passages about those unable to fight and elaborating on different types of Jihad. I have expanded the list to include Jihad of money, the self, and fighting against Satan and hypocrites, with cited verses and hadiths. The translation of verses 48:17, 9:91, 61:10-11, 35:6, and 2:168 are underway, and the hadith of Fadālah ibn ‘Ubayd is considered.

Cataloging Diverse Interpretations

I've just added to the diverse interpretations of Jihad, expanding the previous list with types like Jihad against people of innovation, those who ascribe themselves to Islam but engage in polytheistic practices, corruptors on Earth, and speaking truth to an unjust ruler. I am including the specific verses, such as 42:21, 39:45, and 5:33, as well as hadiths from Abū Umāmah and Jābir, alongside those from Abu Bakr. I'm also addressing the importance of righteousness towards parents, Hajj for women and the weak, and aiding the widow and poor.

Expanding the Scope

I'm now carefully translating the section on Abū Hurayrah, focusing on the discussion of Takfiris, new groups like the "Mubaddi'un", and the dangers of Bid'ah. I'm highlighting the comparison between Bid'ah and Shirk, quoting Sufyān al-Thawrī and Muḥammad al-'Uthaymīn. I'm carefully translating the nuance that the declaration of disbelief is for scholars only.

Analyzing Religious Nuance

I'm presently translating the section on zeal for religion and the issue of not differentiating between actions and actors. I'm focusing on the dangers of simplistic views and emphasizing the context, particularly the nuances around "Ghayrah". I'm meticulously incorporating the stories and arguments presented to accurately reflect their context. I am also working on the story of Shaykh 'Abd al-Raḥmān ibn Yūsuf 'Abd al-Ṣamad and his experience.

Transcribing Personal Anecdotes

I'm now capturing a humorous narrative about an interaction with a person revealing their Wahhabi affiliation. I'm carefully translating the dialogue where an individual feigns knowledge of a religious practice while disparaging scholars. Also, I'm working to include details about a "Haytawi" (transliterated to preserve meaning), and the date of an important fatwa.

Clarifying Specifics

I'm presently translating details about a specific term and local slur, "Haytawī Qurashī", accurately transliterating it from the Arabic. I've noted a Fatwa about the Festival of Qarqia'an, and am working on an important alert to be incorporated within the text.

Expanding Terminology

I'm now focusing on a more granular level of the translation, meticulously translating terms like Jihad, Takfir, Bid'ah, and Tawhid with precision. I am carefully transcribing names of important religious scholars like Qayyim, Dāwūd, Faḍālah ibn 'Ubayd, al-Albānī, Ibn al-Jawzī, and others, maintaining accuracy in transliteration. I've also noted several key terms. I've made sure to expand the list by including "peak of the hump of Islam".

Translating Obscure References

I'm now grappling with the nuanced translation of the saying "Whoever concealed his innovation from us, his familiarity/intimacy is not hidden from us," ensuring the intended meaning is clear. Also, I'm carefully translating "حوصة الحُمُر المستنفرة" as "The fleeing of startled donkeys" to convey the original intent. I am also currently working on the correct use of "Haytawī Qurashī", transliterated. The accuracy is key here. I'm noting the "Gargia'an" translation. I have now completed a final verification against all specified constraints.

Verifying Translations

I am now carefully verifying the accuracy of the translations. I've rechecked the translation of "Haytawī Qurashī", and I'm ensuring all proper nouns, particularly religious scholars and verses, are correctly rendered. I have also verified all the section IDs for consistency and flow. The core concepts, such as Takfir, Bid'ah, and the various forms of Jihad, are all being thoroughly reviewed for nuance and correctness.

Finalizing the Translation

I'm now meticulously refining the translation's scholarly tone and accuracy. I've rechecked the literal rendering of "من ستر عنا بدعته لم تخف علينا ألفته" as "Whoever concealed his innovation from us, his familiarity is not hidden from us," accurately reflecting the original meaning. Additionally, the phrase "ذروة سنام الإسلام" is now correctly translated as "peak of the hump of Islam." I have also double-checked the proper translation of "Haytawī Qurashī", preserving its original form to reflect its specific local nuance. My attention now turns to the entire translation for coherence and fidelity to the source.

Analyzing Key Concepts

I'm now deeply immersed in the nuances of Takfir, Bid'ah, and Jihad, ensuring accurate translation of these complex religious concepts. I'm carefully translating the hadith, poetry, and quotes, ensuring fidelity to the original meaning. This includes the nuanced arguments regarding "Theorist", and discussions on leadership and authority within Islam.

I've been meticulously analyzing the user's initial request. I'm focusing intently on defining the precise role needed - a professional Arabic to English translator who is an Islamic content specialist. This initial breakdown will heavily influence the subsequent stages and suggested translations. I'm committed to building the perfect user profile.

Developing the Translation Framework

I'm now fully immersed in the core translation parameters. Accuracy is paramount, dictating a preference for literal translations whenever feasible, with semantic shifts only for the sake of clarity. I'm meticulously integrating the glossary of Islamic technical terms (aqeedah, manhaj, etc.) to ensure terminological precision, while strictly adhering to the specified formatting constraints, even the plain-text limitation.

Revising Segment Translations

I'm now deep-diving into the first segment. The initial draft yielded "People of the Sunnah" but I am reconsidering it based on the client's directive. I am carefully weighing the merits of "Ahl al-Sunnah" and the literal accuracy of "People of the Sunnah and Prayer", keeping in mind the context and the required persona. My focus is on achieving the perfect blend of accuracy and accessibility for this particular segment.

Analyzing Segment Accuracy

My work now centers on the "Sunnah wa-al-Salah" passage. I've decided to render it as "People of the Sunnah and the Prayer," adhering to literal precision. Next, I'm tackling the newspaper article, translating the factual details verbatim. Then, the critique of the debate requires careful handling of key terms like "Lam yusnid-ha" and "Abqariyyat Khalid". I plan to translate the key term accurately and I'm currently translating the rules for narration, focusing on authentic transmission.

Translating Further Rules

I am now translating the second and third rules for discourse. I'm focusing on "fitnah" as civil strife and adhering to the hadith's instruction to withhold commentary. My current draft emphasizes defending the companions and underscores the importance of Isnad. This includes clarifying Jarh wa Ta'dil, and will mention Imam Muslim's introductory role.

Examining Gambling's Modern Forms

I'm now deeply immersed in the nuances of modern gambling, specifically "maysir." The translations are coming together, highlighting the verses prohibiting it. I've incorporated Ibn Taymiyyah's analysis on benefit versus harm. I'm focusing on the contemporary manifestation of this practice. I'm also including the insightful perspective from Al-Sa'di. I'm now developing the concluding points on this topic.

Evaluating Nuances of Discourse

I'm now meticulously evaluating the nuances of the discourse. I'm focusing on "So I say (an excuse to your Lord and perhaps they will fear Him)...". I've moved on to the topic change, verification before judging. Verses 49:6 come to the fore, with a quote from Ibn Uthaymin on how to handle information about scholars, and I'm currently translating "...adorned with verification...". I'm also delving into Sheikh Abdul-Muhsin Al-Obeikan, translating his defense against attacks and his stance against "movement-oriented preachers", along with a brief biography. I'm now also detailing his career in the judiciary.

Revising Segment Focus

I'm now carefully revising the focus of the current segment. I've translated short quotes from Ibn Taymiyyah and others for the benefits section. I've also moved onto analyzing people who see the truth as falsehood. This includes referencing verses about the splitting of the moon, and a relevant hadith concerning Abdullah ibn Salam and the Jews, along with the defense of Sheikh Muhammad Aman Jami and a critique of modern speakers.

Evaluating Shura and Democracy

I'm now fully immersed in comparing democracy with Shura, exploring the differences. I'm focusing on "rule of the people" versus "rule of consultation," examining elections versus selection, and the concepts of majority versus truth and accountability. I'm carefully translating the key points and developing the conclusion. Next, I'll be reviewing the order and IDs of the pages, making adjustments as needed.

Finalizing Terminological Accuracy

I'm now refining the terminology, particularly regarding gambling-related terms. I've decided on "kubah" for its literalness, and "movement-oriented" to capture "harakiyyin." I'm also ensuring consistent ALA-LC transliteration for names, double checking terms like "ahl al-hall wa-al-aqd." The plain-text limitation necessitates clarity while retaining nuance. I'm aiming for the best possible rendition within the given constraints.

Refining Name Transliteration

I'm now focusing on a crucial aspect - standardizing the transliteration of all names. I've begun reviewing the provided list, ensuring consistent ALA-LC usage across the board. This meticulous approach is vital for maintaining accuracy and clarity, especially within the plain-text environment. It's a key part of ensuring the translation is both accessible and respectful.

I need to translate Arabic text from a file, while preserving IDs. Arabic Quranic verses should be translated into English, and headings and footnotes must be included. I'll use ALA-LC transliteration but only for narrators in the hadith chain like "Abū Saʿīd al-Khudrī." I'll leave the scholars' names (e.g., Ahmad, al-Shāfiʿī) untranslated.

Clarifying transliteration and translation guidelines
The instruction specifies ALA-LC transliteration only for narrators in the chain (e.g., Abū Saʿīd al-Khudrī). For other names (like Ibn Taymiyyah), I'll avoid diacritics and use plain transliteration without them. For terms like Allah and رب, I'll translate "الله" as Allah and keep "Lord" or "Rabb" for "رب".

Clarifying translation and formatting guidelines
For Islamic translations, I'll use "Allah" for God unless referring to an ilah, and "your Lord" where necessary. I’ll avoid diacritics in names, and for hadith chains, only transliterate the narrator's name (e.g., Abū Saʿīd al-Khudrī) while keeping other details like “al-Bukhari” intact. I'll provide plain text with footnotes and ensure proper alignment.

Handling Arabic phrases and terms for translation
I’ll translate the Quranic verses in P137 and earlier, including al-Tawbah and al-Furqan. For phrases like "لا حول ولا قوة إلا بالله," I’ll use "There is no might nor power except with Allah." In terms like "manhaj" and "bidʿah," I’ll stick to their transliterations (with diacritics like ʿ) since they are technical terms.

Deciding on transliteration and translation choices
I’m confirming the use of transliterated terms like "bidʿah" vs. a direct translation. Even though the technical terms should be kept in Latin letters, I think I’ll avoid Arabic characters unless necessary. The instrument names “مصلصلات وشبابات” might be better translated as "certain bells and flutes" instead of transliterating them exactly. I'll consider using a web search for obscure terms like “التغبير” to ensure accurate translation.

Translating Arabic text with specific formatting rules
Clarifying translation and citation approach for music instruments
I’ve found that "taghbir" involves chanting with instruments, and “مصلصلات وشبابات” translates to "jingling tambourines and flutes." I’ll reflect this in the translation, but without extra formatting, since the user asked for plain text. Although citation seems necessary, the request was clear, no markdown included.

Clarifying citation inclusion and line numbering
I need to include a citation in plain text but ensure it aligns with user guidelines. The current content from file_search doesn’t include line numbers, which I need for proper citation. I’ll call for a numbered chunk to get the necessary line markers for citation.

Finalizing file search for citation inclusion
Even though the user didn't ask for citations, the system requires them. I'll search for the relevant pages (P135c, P137) and gather line ranges. Afterward, I’ll add minimal citation references at the end of the response, ensuring all necessary information is covered without overwhelming the user.

Addressing the citation format issue
I'll make sure not to include any Arabic script in the citations, except for the ﷺ symbol as required. Following the user's request for plain text, I'll minimize citation formatting, keeping IDs and line references while ensuring no unnecessary Arabic is included in the response.

Translating headings and formatting carefully
I'll include a blank line between segments where needed but avoid using any markdown. For headings like "الرجال أفضل من النساء", I'll translate as "Men are better than women" without using uppercase. For specific phrases, I'll ensure literal translations, considering whether using macrons for transliterations like "Rabīʿ al-Awwal" is acceptable. I'll aim to stay clear of formatting errors.

Deciding on diacritic use and translation guidelines
The instruction says to use ALA-LC for names only, so I'll avoid diacritics for months like "Rabi' al-Awwal" and names like Abdulaziz bin Baz. For hadith chain names like Abū Saʿīd al-Khudrī, I'll keep diacritics. I'll provide translations for Quran verses and skip citations since it's just translation.

Translating terms and hadith context
For hadith quoting Bukhari and Muslim, I'll translate "Narrated by al-Bukhari... and by Muslim..." clearly. "كفر العشير" means "ingratitude to one's husband", so I'll translate "and you are ungrateful to the husband." I'll use "beardless youths" for "مردان" and "women" for "نسوان". For "الأناشيد الإسلامية," the translation will be "Islamic nasheeds".

Translating terms and maintaining consistency
For "nasheeds," I'll keep it as "Islamic nasheeds," since it's a commonly used term. "التغبير" will be translated as "taghbir," with the term kept in parentheses. "السماع المحدث" will be "innovated sama' (listening session)." I'll also preserve footnote markers and translate "Majmu' al-Fatawa, volume 11" without diacritics and use quotation marks for quoted content.

Finalizing translation and citations formatting
I need to keep the language smooth while translating, preserving rhetorical questions in the original style. I'll separate segments clearly, ensuring that alignment with numeric markers is accurate. Citations will go at the end of the last translation segment, with the phrase "End of his words" leading into it. No markdown for citations, just plain text. I'll craft the translations carefully- the excerpt begins with a reflection on "Islamic nasheeds" from the past, followed by quotes from scholars like Imam Ahmad, Imam al-Shafi'i, and Ibn Taymiyya.

Clarifying religious violations and translation
This segment talks about the issues surrounding Sufi singing and religious nasheeds becoming secularized, leading to violations. It mentions the imitation of non-believers, referencing the Qur’an. The translation includes a verse from al-Furqan 30, quoting the Prophet ﷺ. I’ll also translate the actions of figures like Nabil al-Awadi and Mishari al-Afasi, focusing on their behavior and urging repentance and correction. The segment will close with a prayer for the Prophet ﷺ.

Clarifying footnotes and translation for P136
There seems to be a footnote referencing a musical instrument type in P135c but placed in P135d—I'll keep it as (1) for a musical instrument reference. For segment P136, I’ll translate an article where a writer addresses the concept of women's intellect, responding to claims that women are deficient in intellect and religion. The following segment discusses the Prophet ﷺ's hadith about women, their testimonies, and their role in religious duties like menstruation and fasting.

Clarifying statements on gender roles and verses
The Prophet ﷺ clarified that women’s testimony in financial matters requires two women instead of one man, as explained in the verse on debt. The writer questions the notion of male superiority, citing the verse "Men are caretakers over women." He also contrasts this with examples from countries like the US and Germany.

Translation and discussion on justice
The text explains several Quranic verses emphasizing the difference between believers and polytheists, such as al-Baqarah 2:221 and al-Sajdah 32:18. It critiques examples of female leadership from nations like Pakistan and Bangladesh, questioning the permissibility of women leading men. The writer reinforces the idea that Islam is about justice, not equality, citing verses like 4:58 and 16:90.

I need to translate segments and remove Arabic characters, except for ﷺ. Qur'anic verses and parenthetical Arabic words need to be translated, keeping the IDs intact (e.g., P198b). I’ll also translate any Qur'anic quotes into English and switch names to ALA-LC transliteration without using Arabic letters for narrators.

Considering transliteration choices for names
The instruction only asks for ALA-LC transliteration for narrators in the chain, so for other names, I'll probably stick to common English forms and avoid diacritics. But for scholars or notable figures, using ALA-LC might be accurate even if it includes diacritics. For example, "Mūsā" for Moses seems fine as it's generally translated this way in Islamic content.

Deciding on transliteration for scholars
The instruction specifies ALA-LC transliteration only for narrators in the chain. So using "Ibn ʿUthaymīn" elsewhere might go against the guidelines, but I could still use common English for scholars like "Shaykh Ibn Uthaymīn." Since they specialize in Islamic content, they might want consistency across names but only in chain for full transliteration.

Clarifying transliteration rules for names
The instruction is clear: ALA-LC transliteration should only apply to narrators in the isnad. For non-chain names, I’ll stick with common English spellings without diacritics (e.g., Ibn Uthaymeen, al-Albani). Arabic terms like tawhid, sunnah, and others should remain unchanged, as they’re not part of the isnad.

Handling technical terms and phrases
I'm using technical terms like tawhid, al-Sunnah, shirk, and bid'ah as required. For terms like aqeedah and manahij, I'll translate based on context and keep segment IDs in plain text as directed. I'll also follow the instruction to translate صلى الله وسلم وبارك على نبينا محمد into "may Allah send prayers, peace, and blessings..." unless it's exactly صلى الله عليه وسلم, when I'll use ﷺ for consistency.

Translating and transliterating with care
It seems like I should translate all mentions of blessings on the Prophet to "ﷺ," and address terms like "ṣallā Allah wa sallam..." properly too. For terms like "ʿiṣāmiyyah," I'll focus on translating meaning clearly, using transliteration where necessary. I'll ensure segment markers and keep formatting like punctuation intact.

Considering accurate translation and transliteration choices
It seems it's better to keep the term "ʿiṣāmiyyah" (sit-in), even if it's a little off, to stay true to the original, since it was written that way. For things like titles, "Liqa' al-Bab al-Maftuh" seems fine to transliterate. I'll translate "lā ilāha illā Allah" meaning "there is no ilah except Allah."

Translating terminology and maintaining format
For "متعالمي زماننا," I'll translate it as "the pseudo-scholars of our time" or "those who pretend to be scholars," keeping the claim in the quote. "Illā al-Dustūr" will be translated as "seminar 'Nothing but the Constitution.'" I'll also use "Ibn Baz, al-Albani, Ibn Uthaymin" for the names, and keep "the Saba'iyyah" as is, ensuring consistency. I'll avoid Arabic numerals and maintain the plain text format with careful translation.

I've begun by analyzing the request thoroughly. The critical aspects are the translator's specialized role in Islamic content and the specific source material: Fatawa and articles from Salim al-Tawil's website. This will heavily influence my approach to the task.

Formulating the Translation Plan

I've finalized my translation strategy. Accuracy is paramount, especially regarding Islamic technical terms and narration chains. I'll meticulously preserve the original IDs and format, adhering to specific rules like using "Allah" and ﷺ. My revision process involves three thorough passes: alignment, contextual accuracy, and transliteration. I've begun to tackle P137a and am focused on accurately translating the concept of Nafir in this specific context.

Evaluating the Arguments

I'm now carefully examining the arguments. I'm focusing on the concepts of Nafir and Wali al-Amr and their interpretation within the given Hadith. The draft translation is taking shape, distinguishing between the authority of the leader and the call of an individual. Al-Awadi's statements are under scrutiny, particularly regarding the Ummah's readiness. I'm critically analyzing the sub-heading's implications and Tawil's rebuttal.

Discerning Underlying Motives

I'm now delving into the accusations leveled by Al-Awadi, specifically the list against Salafis. I'm carefully refining the list, identifying key accusations such as the "Quran not exceeding their collarbones," a Khawarij trait. I'm also analyzing the intent behind Al-Awadi's statements on Bid'iyyah in calling to repentance, highlighting corrupt motivations like leadership and money within certain Da'wah methods. My attention is also on the criticism of those Salafis who do not engage in Jihad.

Analyzing Nasheed Usage

I'm currently engaged with the debate surrounding Islamic Nasheeds. I've compiled relevant Quranic verses, specifically highlighting the Salafi position that Nasheeds lack scriptural grounding, unlike the Quran. The focus is on the distinction between worship and amusement, highlighting that Nasheeds, when treated as a form of worship, mirror Christian practices, which is a key point in my analysis. I'm referencing Ibn Taymiyyah's Majmu' al-Fatawa for supporting evidence.

Clarifying Kafir Classifications

I'm now focusing on the classifications of "Kafir," with a detailed breakdown of Mu'ahid, Musta'min, Dhimmi, and Muharib. I'm examining their respective statuses and implications, referencing relevant Hadith and modern applications, like visas and treaties. My analysis highlights the conditions for warfare, particularly the need for a clear banner, established authority, and capability. The source I'm currently consulting is P153a, "والخلاصة...".

Defining the Kafir Status

I'm now carefully navigating the sensitive issue of declaring someone a Kafir. I understand this action demands adherence to Allah's decree and does not automatically justify violence. I'm currently reviewing Sheikh Ibn Uthaymin's post-9/11 audio clip, which addresses extremist mentalities and actions. I've noted the Sheikh's criticism of "The Brothers," who act without wisdom. I am also reviewing pages P153b, P154 and P154a.

Examining Abu Bakr's Legacy

I'm now focusing on affirming Abu Bakr's status, noting that denying his companionship is considered Kufr, referencing Quran 9:40. I'm reflecting on our daily sins and tendency towards self-righteousness, inspired by the poetry: "If you knew, it is a calamity..." I'm also considering the importance of self-accountability (Muhasabah), incorporating Sayyid al-Istighfar. Moreover, I'm examining P155, which stresses establishing the proof (Hujjah) through verses like 8:42 and 4:165. My attention then moves to P155a, which starts with a criticism of invitation.

Identifying the Threats

I'm now analyzing the implications of allowing deviant figures, specifically Sufi extremists like Habib al-Jifri, into the country (Kuwait). Their audio and video broadcasts expose their clear deviance. I'm focusing on the ethical dilemma of enabling their message. Additionally, I'm examining verses like 7:179, which speaks of those destined for Hell. I'm also deeply troubled by the invitation of this person back, given the evidence against him. My hope is that Allah purifies the land. I'm moving on to exploring the joy of the Quran.

Revising Nasheeds

I'm now revising the translation related to Nasheeds. I've incorporated Ibn Kathir's perspective on the Quran's role as guidance and cure, contrasting its value against worldly pursuits. I am also adjusting the translation for wali al-amr, al-qassas, and al-nafir for clarity, and I'm correcting the transliteration of names such as Abd al-'Aziz bin Baz and Habib al-Jifri, with reference to the original Arabic. I also fixed the grammatical sentence structure of the sentence, "أين هؤلاء الملايين؟".

Finalizing Footnotes

I'm now focusing on finalizing the translation of the footnotes. I'm carefully incorporating them into the translated text, ensuring they logically fit where the markers appear, following the original flow and context. I'm meticulously attending to the original sources, ensuring that the integrity of the information and the intended message are fully conveyed. I am particularly focused on the handling of Ahl al-Sunnah and Khuruj. The footnote content marked "(1)" will be placed at the end of the appropriate section.

Refining Translation Adjustments

I'm now implementing the last adjustments across the text. I've focused on incorporating the block of text from P155c, including the footnote marked (1), at its appropriate position at the end of the section. I have meticulously reviewed and translated the specific content related to Kafir handling, ensuring it reflects the intended arguments in bold and clear terms. My attention is also on accurately differentiating between Muharib and Mu'ahid according to relevant fiqh distinctions. I am ensuring all proper names adhere to the ALA-LC transliteration standard and all instances of "God" are accurately rendered as "Allah". Additionally, I have reviewed the usage of ﷺ to ensure proper application.

Implementing the Final Revisions

I'm now implementing the last adjustments. I've focused on translating the phrase "Did they not suffice with..." accurately. I incorporated the footnote "(1)" from P155c, placing it at the end of the appropriate section. I have meticulously reviewed and translated the specific content related to Kafir handling, ensuring it reflects the intended arguments. I'm also addressing the Hadith in P137a. I've corrected "Islamic Anasheed" in P152b to "Islamic Nasheeds" and maintained the translation of "word of truth in the presence of an unjust ruler". My current attention is on verifying that Sheikh Uthaymin died before 9/11 in the translation. I've fixed the footnotes.

I need to translate Arabic to English, keeping the segment IDs intact and using ALA-LC transliteration for narrator names in chains, but not for textual content. Other Arabic names might not need transliteration. Since accuracy matters and the user wants Islamic terminology, I’ll aim to follow that closely and use standard transliteration where appropriate.

Clarifying translation approach
The instruction says to use ALA-LC transliteration only for narrators in chains, so I'll simplify transliteration for other names without diacritics. “Allah” will always be used instead of "God" unless referring to "ilāh." For ﷺ, it’s clear I should translate وكل الثانية expressions as “and upon his family and all his Companions.”

Addressing transliteration and translation choices
For "صلى الله وسلم على نبينا محمد", I'll translate it as "may Allah send prayers and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad ﷺ." Since the instruction specifies ALA-LC only for narrators in chains, I’ll avoid using diacritics on "Muhammad" and stick to the plain transliteration. As for other terms like "manhaj," I'll leave them as transliterations too, since they’re technical terms.

Translating hadith terms and segment IDs
For terms like "al-jarh wa al-taʿdil" and "Ahl al-Sunnah," I'll use transliterations (e.g., "Ahl al-Sunnah") without Arabic script. For terms like "liars, fabricators," I'll translate precisely. I’m also ensuring that the Quranic citations are properly translated with corresponding Surah names, and keeping the text with segment IDs as plain text, avoiding uppercase headings.

Translating and maintaining consistency in terms
For "حطام الدنيا," I’ll translate it as “the trappings of this world” or “the scraps of this world” for a more literal rendering. For terms like "Khariji" and "Qadari," I’ll keep them in transliteration due to their technical context, while translating other phrases like "the Masonic tide" as appropriate. I'll also ensure proper translation of titles and quotations, like "Allah knows best," and maintain the numbering marks.

Translating Arabic terms and keeping in line with specifications
I'll translate "1416هـ" as "1416 AH" and ensure phrases like "قبل أكثر من عشر سنوات" are kept literal as "before more than ten years." For Arabic script, I'll convert to English; so "Dhu al-Hijjah" instead of "ذي الحجة" and "Arafah" instead of "يوم عرفة". Surah names like "Ibrahim" and bracketed citations will be transliterated without Arabic script.

Translating key phrases and concepts
I should use "deity" for "ilah" (yes, that's appropriate). For phrases like "وكم من محروم," I'll translate as "How many are deprived..." and "وكم من ضال" as "How many misguided, lost from worshipping his Lord to worshipping a created being like himself."

For specific terms, like "عيدين اثنين," it translates as "two Eids each year.” I'll also translate verses and hadith carefully, ensuring clarity.

Clarifying translations and concepts
For phrases like "يقف فيه الحجاج، فلا يصح الحج إلا به," I'll translate it as "The pilgrims stand here, and the pilgrimage is not valid without it." Similarly, "ويصومه استحباباً" becomes "Those who are not pilgrims fast it as a recommended act, and Allah expiates through it two years [of sins]."

I'll ensure clarity with "Eid al-Fitr" and "Eid al-Jumu'ah," translating “the weekly Eid” appropriately. The rest about Ahl al-Ahwa and quotes from Ibn Kathir will be handled with care too.

Understanding technical terms and nuances
The translation approach should be clear and accurate. “ينفون عنها تحريف الغالين وانتحال المبطلين” translates as "repel from it the distortion of extremists..." I’ll translate technical terms like “jarh” and “ta'dil” while possibly adding a brief explanation. Otherwise, I'll apply common transliterations, like “sahih,” “hasan,” and “da'if,” where needed. Also, for terms like “Munkar” and “Mawdu,” keeping clarity is key.

Formatting guidelines and preserving clarity
When translating, I'll keep Arabic text with necessary adjustments. I'll stick to numbering only if used in the original (like "4-"), but generally, I'll leave sentences separate without adding extra numbers. I’ll also replace Arabic punctuation with English equivalents, while keeping special symbols like "ﷺ." I'll

I see that transliteration is only meant for the names of narrators in the chain. For example, names like 'ʿĀʾishah', 'Abū Hurayrah', 'Ibn Mājah', and more. Diacritics like macrons and dots from ALA-LC should be used for accuracy. It’s a bit unclear whether author names or scholars fit within this, but I’ll prioritize the chain narrators’ names.

Deciding on transliteration for non-chain names
So, the rule is clear for narrators in the chain to use ALA-LC transliteration. For other names, like scholars, it’s a bit tricky. The user seemed to focus on narrators, so I think keeping them in common English transliteration for others is safer, even though it may feel inconsistent.

Confirming transliteration and translation rules
For chain names, I'll use ALA-LC with diacritics, but for non-chain names, regular English transliteration without diacritics, such as "Shaykh Abd al-Rahman Abd al-Khaliq." I'll also translate "Allah" for God, and “ربك” as your Lord. I'll follow these rules and avoid all-caps headings, sticking with standard translations.

Deciding on technical terms and transliteration
For technical terms like "mawqūf" and "marfūʿ," I'll use transliteration with diacritics since it's not a narrator name but still a key Islamic term. I'll also provide an explanation, like "mawqūf (stopped at the Companion)." While literal translations like "stopped" may work, I'll preserve transliteration since it's the norm for these terms.

Translating technical terms and references
For clarity, I'll use transliteration in parentheses for terms like "al-Jahiliyyah" (pre-Islamic period) and "Jamāʿat al-Tablīgh" without diacritics since they aren’t part of the chain. I'll also stick with English surah names without diacritics, like "al-Rum." Religious phrases like "may Allah be pleased with her" will be translated, with hadith citations preserved.

Translating hadith and narrators' names
For the Bukhari hadith, I’ll translate and include the isnad with diacritics only for narrators in the chain such as "Sahl ibn Saʿd." I won’t transliterate the Qur’anic verses or other terms like “O Messenger of Allah.” I'll ensure clarity while translating, using ellipses where necessary to reflect the original text. For non-chain narrators, I'll keep names in standard transliteration.

Handling names and diacritics for hadith
For names like "Abu Ayyub al-Ansari," even though he's a hadith narrator, I'll avoid using diacritics here since he’s not in a narration chain in this case. I’ll use standard transliteration. Diacritics will be reserved for narrators in the actual chain. For Qur'anic verses or phrases like "رسول الله," they won’t be transliterated. I'll stick to clear English equivalents for better accessibility.

Aligning translation and markers with consistency
For reference markers, I'll stick with "P157d -" and use the same structure for sections like "P158a -," replicating the original format. For verse translations, no transliteration, and the citation token will be placed appropriately, sometimes at the end. Regarding blessings on the Prophet, I will use ﷺ consistently for all variations of "صلى الله عليه وسلم" per the guidance, even if the exact phrase isn’t used.

Translating hadith and ensuring consistency
I’ll make sure to translate phrases like "وصلى الله وسلم" consistently—even if it's not the exact phrase as "صلى الله عليه وسلم"—and keep using ﷺ for clarity. Also, "رضي الله عنه" will be translated, and for Qur'an verse numbers, I’ll go with (al-Rum 21). I'll translate hadith terms such as "moawalīhā" as “her guardians” and ensure literal meaning for phrases like "فإن دخل بها" (If he consummates with her).

I need to translate the Arabic text, keeping the IDs at the beginning. The transliteration should only apply to names of narrators in the chain, not others like Imam Mālik. I'll stick to using common anglicized forms for well-known figures. No Arabic characters except ﷺ, and I'll avoid transliterating non-chain names.

Deciding on diacritics for non-chain names
Okay, for names outside the chain, I need to avoid diacritics. ALA-LC transliteration only applies to narrators in the chain. I'll use standard academic transliteration without macrons, like "Ibn Dihyah al-Kalbi" instead of more complex representations. I can use apostrophes for special characters like "ʿ" without violating the restriction.

Clarifying translation requirements for Arabic names and phrases
I’ll transliterate only the narrators in the chain and use mainstream spellings for other Arabic names, avoiding macrons. For God, I'll use “Allah” unless referring to “ilāh.” I'll translate phrases like "لا حول ولا قوة" with “Allah,” and translate closing salutations with ﷺ when appropriate, like using "May Allah send prayers and blessings on our Prophet Muhammad."

Deciding on use of ﷺ and translation of salutation phrases
The text contains "صلى الله وسلم" without "عليه وسلم," but it’s still tempting to use ﷺ after Muhammad. The instructions specifically mention only using ﷺ with "صلى الله عليه وسلم," not other formulas. However, I'll follow the standard translation practice and use ﷺ where appropriate, ensuring clarity.

Deciding on translation rules and citation handling
I’ll use ﷺ after mentioning Prophet Muhammad in salutations but avoid diacritics unless necessary. For "Seal of the Prophets," I’ll translate it as "and may Allah send prayers upon the Seal of the Prophets," with a mention of Muhammad ﷺ when appropriate. Technical terms will be translated, but “Sahih Muslim” is fine without diacritics. For citations, I’ll include them in plain-text at the end as required, without Arabic characters.

Ensuring translation clarity and consistency
At the end, I’ll include the citation "(website)" as required. I'll adjust the Arabic characters like "خ" to "Kh" and change "(ع. ش)" to "(A. Sh.)". Arabic numerals are fine, but I'll ensure no Arabic letters remain in the text. The translation will capture the tone of direct speech from Salim al-Tawil, and I'll follow the ID structure for each segment.

Translating criticism of hadith and scholarly references
The translation must reflect a critical tone towards Brother Adnan’s reliance on certain scholars. The quote will be kept, translating the dialect phrase for clarity, and emphasizing the challenge to the authenticity of the hadith. I'll ensure the names and scholarly references are mentioned clearly, addressing the conditions of those sources.

Translating responses and exaggerations in criticism
The translation should reflect a direct and critical tone towards Brother Adnan, especially addressing his incorrect claims. I'll preserve phrases like "Where is the dust from the Pleiades" and "O brother Adnan," and ensure the criticism focuses on the reliance on certain scholars and the misrepresentation of hadith. When translating, I'll keep the emphasis intact, but clarify key terms like "عالة عليه."

Describing troubling experiences of youth radicalization
A new article begins detailing the anguish parents face when their children are influenced by harmful ideologies, often starting through innocent connections at mosques. Youth are lured with promises of religious piety and trips, only to end up in tragic circumstances like being recruited for jihad. It's a heartbreaking portrayal of how easily belief and actions can be manipulated.

Ensuring precise technical translation choices
When translating, I'll make sure to use the proper Islamic technical terms and transliterations, like ʿaqīdah for beliefs and manhaj for approach. It's important to ensure clarity, so terms like "suicide operation" and "human shield" are translated accurately. I’ll also include certain phrases in their technical form, ensuring a more culturally sensitive rendition in line with the user's request.

Ensuring precise translation and context accuracy
I'll be careful with idioms, for example, translating "أين الثرى من الثريا" as "how far apart," and "فوا أسفا" as "alas." I'll handle technical terms like "ʿaqīdah" and "manhaj" with transliterations, as requested. For certain phrases, I'll provide meanings, such as "takbir" and "tahlil," to uphold context while maintaining clarity for the reader.

Translating specific terminologies and ensuring precision
I need to carefully translate terms like "dāʿīs" as "preachers" and "callers," and address references to specific works like tafsir, ensuring clear understanding for the reader. For terms like "Sahih Muslim" and others mentioned, I should avoid diacritics and follow ALA-LC transliteration for names, maintaining consistency throughout.

I'm currently focused on the Salafi context of Salim al-Tawil's Fatawa. My priority is understanding the nuances of his language for accurate translation. I'm carefully analyzing the source material, considering the specific terminology and potential interpretations within this particular Islamic framework.

Developing the Methodology

I've established meticulous translation guidelines, prioritizing accuracy and Islamic terminology. I'm focusing on preserving Isnad and transliterating narrator names. Specific rules for Arabic elements (Allah, ﷺ) are set. I'm maintaining plain text output and IDs, including a three-pass revision system, with special emphasis on avoiding uppercase chapter headings.

Dissecting Key Concerns

I'm now carefully dissecting the problematic use of "Jihad" in this context. It's a fundamental tenet of Islam, but the issue lies in its misappropriation by certain groups. I'm focusing on the language used to describe the recruitment of children and the resulting danger. The primary point of contention is not the act of Jihad itself, but the distorted methodology employed. I'm also grappling with the nuanced meaning of "Awliya al-umur" and its implications.

Enumerating Jihad's Parameters

I'm now focusing on a series of questions related to Jihad's conditions, analyzing each for their precise implications. These questions explore the "who, what, when, where, why, and how" of Jihad, delving into specific scenarios like covenants with non-Muslim states. I'm carefully considering the subtleties of these inquiries for clarity and a balanced perspective.

Analyzing Jihad Conditions

I'm now deep-diving into the intricate conditions surrounding Jihad, as detailed by Salim al-Tawil. I'm addressing questions like the definition of a Muslim state, the implications of fighting a Muslim state attacking another, and seeking help from a non-Muslim state. I'm also considering scenarios involving the ruler's permission, parental consent, and the practicality of the campaign. The final critical question: who gets to decide on these matters? I'm also grappling with the gravity of Jihad, its significance, and the real-world implications versus its symbolism.

Unpacking Extremism's Rhetoric

I'm now focusing on specific examples of extremist rhetoric, analyzing how they portray Jihad and target individuals. Their tactics include Takfir, slandering advisors, and labeling opponents. I'm also drafting counter-arguments highlighting the dangers of their approach and emphasizing the existence of moderate figures within Islamic communities. The transition to addressing the prior questions is also underway.

Answering the Critics

I'm presently tackling direct criticism against my stance. Addressing questions about Jihad denial, brotherhood, and compassion, I'm carefully crafting responses. I want to make it crystal clear: I do not deny Jihad's inherent nature, but I do reject the distorted interpretations and the methodology employed, focusing on the role of legitimate authorities. I'm focusing on crafting counterpoints with emphasis on caution, compassion, and sound Islamic principles.

Debunking the "Whataboutism"

I'm now formulating responses to the "Whataboutism" claims, addressing the assertion that focusing on these deviants means overlooking other societal issues. I'm carefully detailing how I address this in my argument, explaining that I denounce all sins and make it clear that there's no contradiction in condemning both. I'm focusing on their promotion of disobedience and the inherent distinction between sins that are generally known as haram and the "Jihad" claimants' perceived righteousness. I'm also highlighting the significance of the alternative, the importance of fostering upright youth through proper guidance and supplications.

Crafting a Rebuttal

I'm currently engaged in a comprehensive response to Adnan Abdul-Qadir, the focal point of my effort. Initially, I hoped Adnan would benefit from the corrections, however, his seven articles demonstrate otherwise. I'm structuring my response into six key facets, starting with the points he ignored. I'm now delving into the matter of fasting six days of Shawwal, where Adnan incorrectly attributes a statement to Imam Malik. My response will highlight the errors in a clear and structured manner.

Examining Adnan's Claims

I'm now thoroughly examining Adnan Abdul-Qadir's claims regarding the Hadith of fasting six days of Shawwal. I'm focusing on his reliance on Muwatta, where Imam Malik's reluctance to promote it out of fear of it being linked to Ramadan is not evidence of "Bid'ah." I'm carefully analyzing Adnan's alleged "weakening" of the Hadith by Malik and Ahmad, seeking precise sources for his assertions. I'm also ensuring a consistent use of Islamic terminology like "Mawquf," "Tadlis," and "Mu'allal" for precision. I'm also checking for errors, such as P161's "Tuqman al-khutura" and "Muqaddimat".

Reviewing Terminology Refinement

I'm now refining the terminology, ensuring consistent and correct usage across the board. I've corrected minor errors, such as "Kufiyyah" to "Keffiyeh", "Sarawil" to "Trousers/Pants", and "Murji'" to "Murji'ite". I'm also reviewing names and technical terms to maintain precision, including precise transliteration and accurate formatting of titles such as Muwatta, Al-Latā'if, Muntahā al-Irādāt, and Hilyat al-'Ulamā'. My ultimate goal is an extremely accurate rendition.

Addressing Transliteration Refinement

I'm now focusing on meticulous transliteration, paying close attention to the names "Abū Ayyūb" and "Al-Bahūtī," ensuring accuracy and consistency. I'm also double-checking the IDs and verifying the proper usage of "God" versus "Allah" throughout. My priority is to accurately reflect the source material, which includes a detailed translation note on P162g, highlighting the author's nuanced argument about Ibn Rajab's statement and 'Abd Allah b. Ahmad's narration. The polemic nature of the text, specifically concerning the "Project of Jihad," is a key consideration. I'm carefully applying ALA-LC transliteration to all names, including Mālik, Aḥmad, and 'Adnān, to guarantee the highest level of accuracy and conformity with established conventions.

Adjusting the Structure

I'm currently revising the structure on P161r, including the additional unnumbered questions seamlessly within the preceding text for a more logical flow, and adjusting the English translation for clarity. I'm also addressing the distinction between "Jihad" and "Qital," keeping precise terminology throughout. My focus now is ensuring a consistent and accurate representation of the original meaning, including terms like "Awliya al-Umur" to its original context.

Streamlining the Presentation

I'm presently focused on adjusting the structure of the text to improve flow. I'm appending unmarked questions and ensuring a logical progression of ideas, like the "Eighteenth", "Twentieth", and "Twenty-first" questions. I'm also addressing the issue of "The First Face" on P162, ensuring it's seamlessly integrated into the narrative. The priority is clear communication of the argument.

I've been meticulously analyzing the user's request, focusing on identifying the crucial elements. My initial assessment concentrated on the translation task's complexities and sensitivities. I am now delving deeper into the nuances of Salim al-Tawil's Fatawa and the specific context of the response to Ad. My goal is to capture the precise intended meaning.

I'm carefully analyzing the claim that Ad is misrepresenting Ibn al-Madini's stance.

Scrutinizing the Rebuttals

I'm now focusing on the counterarguments, especially those regarding reliance on Jalal al-Din al-Tabbani al-Hanafi. The critique revolves around his credibility as a hadith scholar, which I'm investigating. I am examining claims about the Ummah's acceptance of Sahih Muslim and determining if the weakened hadith falls outside of this acceptance. Furthermore, I am exploring the assertion that specific elements of the counterarguments haven't been adequately addressed.

Assessing the Counterpoints

I'm now carefully evaluating the counterarguments presented, noting the specific points raised regarding Al-Qurtubi's interpretation and the positions of Malik and Ahmad. I'm focusing on the claim that I haven't adequately addressed the assertion that Imam Malik and Ahmad recommend fasting the six days of Shawwal. I'm also critically examining the dismissal of the unnamed hadith professor's reaction as evidence. The goal is to comprehensively address these counterpoints.

Responding to Criticisms

I'm now grappling with the criticisms leveled against my previous engagement. The primary focus is on the specific accusations, particularly the claims of avoiding direct responses. I'm addressing the silence regarding specific issues, such as the Zakat and charity practices, and I'm assessing the implications of this perceived inaction. I am analyzing the accusations of ignoring critiques and the potential ramifications of perceived agreement.

Addressing Sensitive Terminology

I'm currently revising the terminology, replacing "Al-Shadh" and "Al-Shudhudh" with "Al-Ghara'ib" to be clearer and less confrontational. I'm prioritizing accuracy and inclusivity in the language, as suggested, and I'm prepared to modify anything deemed hurtful. My aim is to ensure the translation is respectful while maintaining factual integrity.

Completing the Commentary

I'm diligently working on finishing the response to the critique of Ad, focusing on providing a comprehensive clarification of the key arguments presented. I aim to address the issues raised clearly. I am carefully constructing the response, ensuring that the final output accurately reflects the truth. My focus is on achieving a complete and well-supported conclusion.

Considering the Implications

I'm now analyzing the implications of the "rejection of truth" accusation against Ad and the lament over his supposed "addition of new errors." I'm focusing on Shaykh Ibn Baz's perspective and its application. This involves interpreting his call for unity alongside acknowledging unavoidable divisions within the Muslim community. The aim is to understand the core arguments.

Evaluating the Discrepancy

I'm now meticulously reviewing the critique's central argument regarding the misquote, concentrating on the discrepancies between the versions of the hadith attributed to 'Ubayd ibn 'Umayr. The focus is on the contrasting texts provided by Ibn Hajar and Ibn al-Qayyim, particularly the omitted mention of a musical instrument. The core issue is whether this omission constitutes an intentional alteration or an oversight, and the implications of this for my credibility.

Evaluating the Criticism

I am now carefully dissecting the critique and its context. The latest point involves examining the ongoing concerns surrounding Adnan's trustworthiness, specifically regarding a past Fatwa from the Permanent Committee for Ifta. I am focusing on their past denouncements, including a specific fatwa number, and scrutinizing the related details. I am now going to analyze a book by Adnan Abdul-Qadir. I am delving into the arguments and accusations related to his book and its content. I'm prioritizing accuracy and addressing the concerns raised about his work.

I need to translate into English, keeping plain text and leaving the Arabic term ﷺ. The instruction asks for ALA-LC transliteration for narrators in chains—but there are no full chains here, just names. I think I should only transliterate narrators’ names, and leave others as they are.

Transliteration approach for names and content
For non-chain names, I should use established English forms, like "Ibn Bāz," even though that includes diacritics. The instructions only require ALA-LC transliteration for narrators in chains, so I think I can use common spellings without diacritics for other names. I’ll aim for a compromise: use standard transliteration without diacritics.

Translating with common names and ALA-LC for narrators
They specified using ALA-LC transliteration for narrators only in chains. For non-chain names, I shouldn't use ALA-LC diacritics. I'll stick with common forms for names like "Adnan Abd al-Qadir al-Qadiri" and Ibn Baz. For companions, like Thawban, since they are connected to hadith but not chains, I'll keep them common as well.

Handling Islamic terminology and ALA-LC rules
The instructions suggest ALA-LC for names in chains, but what about technical terms like 'ʿaqīdah' and 'manhaj'? Since these aren't part of the chain, I’ll probably use the transliterated versions with diacritics. Maybe I’ll keep 'ʿaqīdah' and 'manhaj' but also offer their English translations for clarity, like "creed."

Handling Islamic terms and translation choices
For terms like 'ʿaqīdah' and 'manhaj,' I’ll use common transliterations without diacritics—‘ʿaqidah’ and ‘manhaj.’ For others like “jarh wa ta'dil,” I’ll leave them untranslated. As for Quranic verses and footnotes, I’ll translate them and avoid Arabic characters, using English equivalents. I'll preserve segment IDs and be mindful of the tone, like in proverbs and book titles. Transliteration will be used without ALA-LC formatting.

I need to translate the Arabic text while keeping narrators' names in ALA-LC transliteration, but avoid applying it to the rest of the content. The key part is preserving the IDs and keeping technical terms and references like "Allah" as is, instead of using "God." Since no isnad chain is provided, I’ll stick to applying transliteration to narrators in the chain only.

Translating Hadith while preserving technical terms
I need to translate "Hadith of Abu Ayyub" appropriately but avoid transliterating the name unless it appears in the chain. I'll use the standard "Abu Ayyub" in English, not transliterating narrators outside the chain. I'll also replace Arabic Qur'an verses with their translations in English, keeping references intact. Lastly, I’ll ensure that the punctuation stays correct and chapter headings aren’t in all caps.

Translating a segment of text
I’m translating this segment with care: "So I say: By Allah, the only turning back is your imitation of the fatwa of the Azhar Committee who forbade portraying the major Companions but not the lesser ones." I’ll focus on translating the specific Arabic text like "والله ما الانتكاس إلى الوراء إلا تقليدك" more like "your regression backwards is nothing but your..." and keep checking for flow.

Translating another segment with pauses for clarification
I’m working through this next part: "The tenth fallacy... I say... you have been unable to come upon an explicit statement from Imam Malik about weakening the hadith of Abu Ayyub." There are clear pauses here, especially where I need to emphasize Malik and Muslim's views. I’m making sure to translate the relevant terms while maintaining clarity on these pauses.

Clarifying translation of footnotes and views
For this part, it seems I need to preserve the exclamation marks and avoid Arabic in the main text. I’ll translate “Muḥammad Mutawallī Shaʿrāwī” with diacritics as it’s a footnote, not part of the chain, so I’m not restricted by the transliteration rule here. I'll ensure the text flows naturally yet stays clear.

Translating and applying transcription rules
I should apply ALA-LC transliteration for names in the chain of narrators, but for others like "Muhammad Mutawalli al-Sha'rawi", I can use standard English with no diacritics. I’ll avoid diacritics unless necessary, like with “Allah”, “Shawwal”, and phrases like “Subhan Allah”. For instruction, I’ll follow standard conventions.

Translating and adjusting formatting
For translations, I'll keep verse numbers and surah references like (55) in parentheses. Arabic terms like "بدع" will be translated as "innovations," and "شيطان مريد" as "a rebellious devil." I’ll also make sure the title transliteration "Sharh al-Sunnah" is without diacritics and avoid Arabic characters in the text.

I'm currently focused on defining the parameters of this new translation project. The core is Arabic religious text, so I am taking special care to take the role of an Arabic-to-English translator of Islamic content. The source material is Fatawa and articles from Salim al-Tawil's website, so I'm also analyzing the context.

Refining Translation Guidelines

I've been meticulously refining my translation guidelines, prioritizing accuracy and precision. I'm focusing on adopting strict Islamic terminology and ensuring that all narration chains remain intact. I'm paying special attention to how to format the text and making sure I'm complying with every single constraint, especially when it comes to capitalization of chapter headings. Additionally, I've implemented a three-pass revision process to ensure quality control. Finally, I've started the translation process and am analyzing the context of P169c.

Analyzing Refutation Principles

I'm now fully immersed in the core principles of refuting deviants, which is crucial for this translation. I'm focusing on key terms like "aghtarra bihi" and "wujub al-radd," understanding their nuances and how they relate to the obligation of rebuttal. I'm also analyzing the need to counter eloquent speakers who might mislead, as well as the importance of clear proofs. The draft is progressing, and the current challenge lies in conveying the urgency and danger of silence.

Addressing the Silent Duty

I'm grappling with the delicate balance between respecting freedom of opinion and the duty to refute harmful ideologies. The Salaf's approach, of actively exposing and refuting deviants, resonates deeply. Remaining silent isn't an option; it's tantamount to concealing divine guidance. My focus is now on articulating the gravity of this responsibility, drawing upon the condemnation of those who withhold truth. This crucial context needs to inform the translation.

Unveiling Concealed Truth

I'm now grappling with the hypocritical double standard of those who champion free speech yet condemn refutations of misguidance. This is central to understanding the scholar's perspective. It highlights the scholars' commitment to truth-telling as a trust from Allah and the need to expose callers to deviation despite accusations of hastiness. My focus is on effectively conveying this condemnation of silence and the need to fulfill this obligation without getting distracted. I'm taking special care of the context found in P169d and P169e.

Exploring Motivations Deeply

I'm now delving into the motivations behind rejecting refutation, particularly those who profit spiritually. I'm focusing on the concepts of fitnah and sincere repentance, also incorporating Ruqyah Shar'iyyah. The hadith about the world's sweetness and nations' trials are key. My draft's starting to take shape, focusing on people who reject criticism while being the most critical of others.

Unmasking Hypocrisy

I'm now focusing on the blatant hypocrisy of those who readily criticize others but recoil at any feedback directed their way, mirroring the scholar's observations. This self-serving double standard, a key element of the current translation, is central. I'm focusing on the warning from Muslim, the hadith about the sweetness of the world, and also on tawbah to incorporate the warning. The goal is to highlight this deceitful behavior through clear and impactful language.

Examining Worldly Trials

I'm now analyzing the Prophet's hadith about wealth being a trial for the Ummah, and am exploring how this connects to the current state of callers. I'm focusing on those who use religious texts for personal gain, and am especially concerned with those who copyright religious resources. I'm trying to convey the idea that these people use the Quran to earn money in exchange for a small amount.

Identifying Exploitation Motivations

I'm now focusing on those who exploit religious teachings for personal enrichment, particularly through various mediums. It's becoming clearer how some prioritize financial gain over genuine guidance, from expensive courses to commercialized Ruqyah. I'm highlighting the hypocrisy and the implications of this approach.

Investigating Exploitative Tactics

I'm now zeroing in on the exploitation of crises for financial gain, particularly through charity solicitation. The Gaza example is crucial, as is the misuse of Awqaf funds. I'm focusing on the accountability for such actions, and the hypocrisy of those who prioritize wealth accumulation over genuine assistance. I'm also analyzing the inherent dangers of such tactics.

Condemning Deception Deeply

I'm now analyzing the exploitation of religious crises for financial gain, using Gaza as a prime example. The misappropriation of charity and Awqaf funds, coupled with the hypocrisy of those prioritizing wealth over genuine assistance, is clear. This includes the haunting image of blood-red high-tech boards. I'm focusing on the accountability for this deception and the inherent dangers in this approach.

Analyzing Spiritual Reckoning

I'm now fully immersed in the weight of accountability on the Day of Resurrection, particularly concerning wealth. I'm grappling with the implications of the Prophet's hadith about how we'll be questioned on our worldly resources, and how this relates to contemporary religious figures. I'm focusing on the contrast between sincere guidance and financial gain. I'm especially focused on Ash-Shu‘arā’ and am analyzing it's meaning.

Analyzing Marital Tranquility

I'm now deeply immersed in the nuances of marital tranquility, central to the article on marriage. I'm focusing on key terms like sakan and ba'ah, and the practical implications of ghadd lil-basar and ihsan lil-farj. The aim is to translate the passage accurately, conveying the essence of seeking refuge in marriage for both physical and emotional well-being.

Translating Marital Dynamics

I'm now focusing on the profound concept of sakan (tranquility) within marriage, aligning it with the Quran's verses. I'm exploring the implications of mutual covering and the importance of marriage as a path to chastity. My goal is to accurately translate and convey these nuanced concepts within the broader context of the article.

Reconciling Religious Guidance

I'm now integrating the prophetic hadith on marriage, emphasizing its significance in lowering the gaze and guarding chastity. I'm focusing on the reward for marrying with sincere intentions of obedience and following the Sunnah. The upcoming translation will aim to highlight the husband's reward in fulfilling marital duties in a permissible way.

Exploring Marital Obligations

I'm now fully immersed in the hadith of Abu Dharr and its implications for marital reward. The passage emphasizes how seeking fulfillment within a lawful marriage garners divine recompense, just as avoiding the unlawful avoids sin. I'm focusing on the additional benefits of marriage, like procreation and strengthening familial ties, and the importance of understanding its prescribed rulings and etiquette, as outlined by scholars. This will be reflected in my translation.

Examining Marriage Abuse

I'm now fully immersed in the concerning issue of marriage with the intention of divorce, a subject deeply debated by scholars. While not focusing on its legal ruling, I'm analyzing the increasing abuse, especially travel for temporary marriages. This trend distorts the image of sincere believers, and I must convey the urgency of this with clarity and sensitivity.

Prioritizing Ethical Nuances

I'm now focusing on the ethical dimensions of temporary marriages, specifically the exploitation and deception involved. The focus is now on the hadith highlighting the importance of loving for your brother what you love for yourself and the warnings against cheating. The goal is to highlight the Prophet's condemnation of such actions and emphasize the duty to fear Allah and avoid these behaviors.

Exposing Exploitative Marriages

I'm now focusing on the implications of exploitative temporary marriages, particularly the women's vulnerability. I'm addressing how some women engage in multiple exploitative marriages, catering to those seeking illicit or temporary relationships. I'm also addressing the fact that some are prone to those seeking marriage with divorce intentions. I'm taking special care when I convey the risks of blackmail, magic, violence, and poisoning.

Investigating Exploitative Tactics

I'm now analyzing the recent example of an individual using the da'wah (call to Islam) as a cover in Western masjids to exploit converts. I'm focusing on the warning of potential riddah (apostasy) associated with those who hide their true intentions. The focus is on the hypocrisy of this exploitation, and this highlights the inherent dangers of such tactics.

Analyzing Apostasy Dangers

I'm now deep into the disturbing pattern of exploitative temporary marriages, particularly focusing on the vulnerability of newly converted Muslim women. It's becoming evident how some individuals manipulate these women under the guise of marriage, leading to repeated divorces. This exposes the dangers of such actions, increasing potential for apostasy. My focus is now on highlighting the deception and urging sincere repentance, considering the consequences of such exploitative behavior.

Analyzing Religious Misconduct

I'm now fully immersed in the concerning issue of using religion as a cover for exploitation and manipulation. I'm focusing on the deceitful behavior highlighted by the context of someone who uses his position to commit evil. I'm focusing on the hypocritical nature of these actions and the implications for both individuals and communities.

Emphasizing Sanctity Deeply

I'm now focusing on the profound sanctity of life, property, and honor.

I'm focusing on the gravity of even seemingly small acts of backbiting, highlighting how impactful even "insignificant" remarks can be. The goal is to highlight the potential hypocrisy of this, which is crucial context. I'm taking special care when drafting this, as it is a key element of the current translation.

Analyzing Hypocritical Discourse

I am now thoroughly engaged in exploring the hypocrisy that cloaks itself in the guise of piety. I'm focusing on those who disguise backbiting as a mere report, even though it's still wrong. The key is in those who claim to not backbite yet, they still do it. This critical context will be central in my translation.

Exposing Hypocritical Speech

I'm now fully immersed in the deceptive tactics people employ to disguise backbiting. I'm focusing on those who claim righteousness, yet still engage in slander, as well as those who elevate themselves by putting others down.

Also, I'm focusing on the deceitful tactics used to mask malicious intent, especially in seemingly innocent expressions, to convey this in the current translation. I'm focusing on the hypocritical context.

Revising Backbiting Descriptions

I'm now revising the translation related to Ibn Taymiyyah's text, focusing on the literal meaning of haḍm. The initial interpretation of "digesting his side" is too ambiguous, so I'm opting for "diminishing his side" to better reflect the original meaning, which is to wrong someone by taking away their right/status. I'm focusing on ensuring clarity while remaining true to the source.

I've initiated the translation process by thoroughly analyzing the request. The focus is on Salim al-Tawil's articles and Fatawa, translating from Arabic to English. I'm aiming for a professional tone and style, which will heavily influence the word choices I make.

I'm also confirming that "Allah" and ﷺ are consistently used. The multi-pass verification process is well underway, ensuring precision at every level.

Exploring Ghibah's Nuances

I'm now grappling with the complexities of Ghibah. The definition, exceptions outlined by Imam Nawawi, and the poetry detailing the six reasons are under intense scrutiny. I'm focusing on preserving the poetry's meaning while maintaining clarity, and ensuring the key terms - Ghibah, Buhtan, and Kabair - are accurately and consistently translated. I'm carefully incorporating Nawawi's critical point about "warning Muslims". I've begun drafting, with meticulous attention to these delicate concepts.

Clarifying the Boundaries

I'm currently engaged with the nuances of permissible critique. The core issue is the misconception surrounding warning against deviant ideologies, which some misinterpret as backbiting. I'm focusing on Al-Mu'allimi al-Yamani's perspective on why people reject truth, and also grappling with Ibn Taymiyyah's critical point on the shariah ruling, and rights of Allah. I'm carefully navigating the delicate balance between legitimate criticism and slander, particularly concerning "Yastateel".

Refining the Framework

I'm presently synthesizing the historical context, specifically focusing on Sayyid Qutb's deviations and Rabee al-Madkhali's refutations. I'm carefully translating Qutb's critique, incorporating key Islamic terms like Takfir and Jahiliyyah, while accurately capturing the essence of Qutb's lack of scholarly foundation. I'm also ensuring the precise translation of Rabee al-Madkhali's description. The analysis of the four reasons for rejection is underway, focusing on the implications and significance of each point. I'm progressing with Dua's translation and standard opening, ensuring clarity.

Identifying Key Works

I'm now carefully translating the titles of key books, ensuring they accurately reflect the originals. Titles like "Nazrat Sayyid Qutb...", "Nazarat fi Kitab al-Taswir...", and "Mata'in..." are receiving meticulous attention. I'm also capturing Abdur-Rahman Abdul-Khaliq's contentious claim of consensus regarding Sayyid Qutb, emphasizing the lack of legitimate consensus on this matter.

Analyzing Nuances of Brotherhood

I'm now deep-diving into the concept of brotherhood, specifically analyzing Saleh al-Fawzan's introduction and Rabee al-Madkhali's stance, including the analogy to Hatib b. Abi Balta'ah. The focus is on the significance of Rabee's refutation and its comparison to a deed of great weight, and I'm ensuring the accurate translation of Sururiyyah. I'm also carefully assessing the opening criticisms of Dr. T.S. regarding the hijab and the term "awrah", ensuring accurate transcription. I'm noting the Hadith chain from Tirmidhi and grading (Sahih), and considering the author’s opinion on this matter.

Revising Critical Points

I'm now meticulously reviewing critical points and refining my approach. Specifically, I'm focusing on the Hadith defense, addressing Dr. T.S.'s apparent lack of understanding, and integrating relevant verses, such as An-Najm: 3-4, to fortify arguments. I'm also incorporating Bakr Abu Zayd's perspective from Hirasat al-Fadilah and a vital quote from Ibn Taymiyyah regarding the necessity of protecting women. I'm carefully revisiting the poem on P173a, ensuring the accurate flow of translated text, specifically addressing the six cases where criticism is permitted. Lastly, the translation of book titles on P174a are receiving extra attention to maintain accuracy.

Investigating Further Sources

I'm now fully immersed in the additional hadith and related commentary. I am focusing on the narrations of al-Tirmidhi, Ibn Hibban, and al-Tabarani regarding awrah. The views of Imam Ahmad and Ibn Taymiyyah regarding the extent of this awrah are crucial for accuracy, and I am cross-referencing these viewpoints. The inclusion of Ibn 'Uthaymin's perspective and his warning against exploitation of women is also very important for a complete translation.

Deepening Analysis of Uthaymin

I'm now fully immersed in al-'Uthaymin's specific commentary on women's issues. His point that women can be a source of trial, and the related hadith are paramount. I'm focusing on his strong stance against exploitation. The Quranic phrase "wa Allahu yahkumu la mu'aqqiba li hukmihi" (and Allah judges; none can reverse His judgement) is also under scrutiny.

Examining Closing Arguments

I'm presently focusing on the closing argument, specifically the author's critique. I'm analyzing the criticism of Dr. T.S.'s approach to Sharia rulings. My focus is on the verses and issues central to the critique: Hudud, apostasy, freedom of belief, polygyny, hijab, and magic. The argument against opening established rulings to public debate is taking shape. I'm carefully translating the phrase about Allah's judgment.

Clarifying Disagreements

I'm now zeroing in on the specific points of contention within the closing argument. The stark contrast between the author's stance and Dr. T.S.'s methodology is clear. I've focused on the verses emphasizing Allah's judgment and the believer's absolute obedience to the Quran and Sunnah. Dr. T.S.'s program, particularly his treatment of issues like hudud as matters open to public debate, is the main point.

Clarifying New Article's Premise

I'm now drafting the introduction to the new article on surveillance. I'm focusing on contrasting legitimate security measures with forbidden intrusive spying. The key is to highlight the delicate balance, which builds on my earlier work on criticism, by advising against dangerous paths, and warning against deception. The introduction expresses gratitude and prayers.

Contrasting Surveillance and Spying

I'm now fully entrenched in the nuances of surveillance versus spying. My focus is clear: legitimate surveillance, when it's for security and national protection, is permissible, perhaps even obligatory. However, I'm finding the distinction between necessary oversight and intrusive spying very critical. I'm drawing heavily on Quran 49:12 and related hadith to solidify this point.

Discern Spying's Harms

I'm now grappling with the implications of spying, emphasizing its potential for regret and disruption, especially within families. I'm now fully immersed in exploring the verse from Al-Hujurat (49:12) to understand the dangers of bad assumption. My key point is that such assumptions can lead to forbidden spying, and ultimately, backbiting, which is a key prohibition.

Clarifying Spying's Prohibitions

I'm now fully focused on the hadith regarding spying's absolute prohibition. The emphasis is clear: suspicion breeds spying, which leads to backbiting. I'm focusing on the prophetic warnings against both suspicion and intrusive spying. The severity of the transgression and its potential to destroy brotherhood is my main concern. I'm integrating the narrations of Abu Hurayrah and Ibn 'Umar and their focus on this issue.

Defining Spying's Damage

I'm now fully immersed in understanding the dire consequences of spying. The hadith's warning, "Allah pursues his awrah, and exposes the spy" resonates deeply. I'm focusing on the potential for heartbreak and family disruption. My primary goal is to illustrate the destructive impact of spying on individuals and families.

Elaborating on Concealment

I am now deeply focused on the hadith from Abu Hurayrah, exploring its crucial call for concealing others' faults and distresses. The strong emphasis is clear: Allah shields those who shield others. This hadith directly reinforces the anti-spying stance, highlighting the importance of compassion. I'm carefully translating each phrase, and building arguments from the core message.

Condemning Women's Spying

I'm now fully immersed in the section on women spying on their husbands. The sheer audacity of this act is shocking; women have no right to this intrusive behavior. It stems from a defective character and the whispers of Shaytan. The contrast between this and the wife's actual duty – aiding her husband in piety – is stark. I'm focusing on the translation, ensuring its impact.

Evaluating Legacy of Scholars

I'm presently focusing on the contrast between Al-Jaza'iri's and Al-Kalbani's differing approaches to fiqh. Al-Jaza'iri's respect for Ibn Baz is striking, and I'm carefully analyzing the impact of a scholar's absence. The statement regarding the fear of fitnah highlights the significance of sound religious leadership. I'm focusing on Al-Kalbani's deviation and the impact on the audience.

Assessing Al-Kalbani's Deviation

I'm now fully immersed in dissecting Al-Kalbani's controversial claims. The boldness of his statements regarding music and scholars, specifically after Ibn Baz's passing, is the core issue. I'm focusing on translating the direct quotations about "the germ of prohibition" to highlight the deviation. I'm also crafting the closing supplication, earnestly praying for protection from all forms of trial, seen and unseen.

Addressing a Misuse

I'm presently focusing on the misuse of "Jazak Allahu Khayran" to prematurely end discussions, neglecting genuine advice and debate. I'm drawing on Usamah ibn Zayd's hadith emphasizing proper gratitude, and Surah Al-Asr's call for truth and counsel. My goal is to craft an introduction, starting with praise of Allah, then highlighting the Sunnah of gratitude and addressing this misguided application to conclude.

Clarifying the Rejection

I am now thoroughly analyzing the problematic behavior of those who reject advice. The core issue is their unwillingness to accept truth or criticism, even when presented with compelling evidence. Their staunch adherence to personal viewpoints, regardless of contrary signs, is deeply concerning. The deceptive use of "Jazak Allahu Khayran" as a conversation-stopper is the main focus.

Reiterating the Core Message

I'm now fully immersed in the central theme. I'm focusing on those who stubbornly reject advice, even when presented with compelling evidence from the Quran and Sunnah. Their misguided use of "Jazak Allahu Khayran" as a conversational shutdown is my primary focus, using evidence from Tamim al-Dari's hadith to solidify my argument. The importance of humility in accepting truth is key.

Analyzing the Misconduct

I'm presently focused on the double standards. I'm noting the apparent disregard for regulations regarding the Tablighi Jamaat, specifically their use of mosques. The deviation from common practice, particularly in Subhan area mosques, warrants deeper scrutiny. I'm focusing on the discrepancy between enforced rules and their application to a specific group, raising concerns about fairness and accountability.

Examining Double Standards

I'm presently focused on the double standards. I am meticulously analyzing the apparent disregard for regulations concerning the Tablighi Jamaat, specifically concerning their mosque usage. The divergence from standard practice, especially in Subhan area mosques, warrants deeper scrutiny. My primary focus is on the discrepancy between rule enforcement and its application to a specific group, raising concerns about fairness and accountability, considering the previous points made.

Addressing the Discrepancy

I'm now zeroing in on the perplexing double standards regarding the Tablighi Jamaat. The glaring inconsistency—enforcement for others, leniency for them—raises serious questions of fairness. The mosque rules are disregarded, raising concerns. The questions are being formulated, demanding clarity from the Ministry.

Analyzing Current Concerns

I'm now diving into the implications of selective enforcement within mosques. The lack of uniform application to the Tablighi Jamaat is a major point of concern, demanding a response. This discrepancy, highlighted by the varied stances of Imams, raises serious questions of accountability. I'm focusing on crafting a direct appeal for clarity from the Ministry of Awqaf.

Clarifying Accusations

I'm now fully immersed in the recurring pattern of accusations leveled against the Salafi approach. Accusations of disabling Jihad, loving Kuffar, hating saints, sectarianism, Tajsim, not loving the Prophet ﷺ, being Nawasib, trivializing sin, normalizing with Jews, compromising, and being soft on innovators are the main focus. I'm carefully translating these attacks, to show the dangers of extremism.

Clarifying Accusations' Issues

I'm now fully immersed in dissecting the recurring accusations leveled against those adhering to the Sunnah, which are often used to silence dissent. Accusations are being dissected regarding a range of issues, including Jihad, loving Kuffar, hatred of saints, sectarianism, Tajsim, and normalizing with Jews. I'm focusing on the translation, to emphasize the seriousness of such slander.

Examining Accusations' Problems

I'm now fully immersed in addressing the frequent accusations levied against those adhering to the Sunnah, often employed to silence dissent. The accusations that are being addressed range from disabling Jihad and showing loyalty to the disbelievers to accusing them of being disbelievers themselves. My focus is on the absurdity of these accusations, and on translating to highlight their inherent flaws. I'm focusing on the quote from Imam Ahmad that "Ikhraj al-nas min al-sunnah shadid!"

Revising the Conclusion

I'm now revising the conclusion, aiming for clarity and impact. The key point remains: defending truth doesn't equate to defending imagined falsehoods. I'm finalizing the supplication for the preservation of our religion. I'm also polishing the final phrase of praise and blessing for Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ). I've checked the identifiers and retranslated "Istashrafaha" to accurately reflect the devil's role.

Clarifying Key Terminology

I'm now clarifying the crucial term differences. I'm focusing on the subtle distinction between Istashrafaha, Zayyanaha, and Awrah. I will translate the first as a general look while the second directly beautifies. In the context of spying, I'll translate Awrah as 'faults/privacies'. Finally, I will leave Manhaj, Aqeedah, Hudud, and Riddah as is. I have made clear translations and the importance of using them.

I've been meticulously analyzing the translation request, zeroing in on the critical aspects. My focus is sharpened on understanding the specific role - a seasoned Arabic-to-English translator with a deep grasp of Islamic content. I'm also delving into the source material, which I've determined involves Fatawa and articles from Salim al-Tawil's website. I'm building a solid foundation to guide my linguistic choices.

Developing Translation Strategy

I'm now deeply immersed in the nuances of translation style. Accuracy is paramount, and I lean towards literal translations, adjusting only when contextual clarity demands it. The use of precise Islamic terminology is a priority, and I'm ensuring consistent formatting, including the preservation of IDs and the specific handling of Arabic characters (e.g., ﷺ). I've meticulously reviewed the detailed instructions, solidifying my approach to preserving narrations, employing ALA-LC transliteration, and adhering to the specific requests for "Allah," ﷺ, and capitalization.

Composing Initial Translation

I'm presently translating the source material and meticulously ensuring accuracy. The key verses are being given careful consideration. I've begun drafting, focusing on capturing the essence of the text while staying faithful to the source. The specifics are becoming clear, including the "Virtues of 'A'ishah" and the relevant hadiths. I'm also addressing the sensitive topic of the Incident of Ifk. I'm also incorporating the specific heading, key terms, and context noted for P180.

Refining the Argument

I'm currently engaged with the nuances of Ahl al-Sunnah and Ahl al-Bid'ah. I'm carefully drafting a paragraph, highlighting the dangers of contemporary channels that propagate innovations. Specifically, my focus is on the strong reaction to such errors.

Analyzing the Debate's Framework

I'm now focusing on the provided evidence and exegesis to support the argument. I've broken down Surah Al-'Ankabut: 46 and Al-Sa'di's commentary to reinforce the need for respectful argumentation, while recognizing exceptions for those who transgress. I'm also carefully incorporating the hadiths from Ibn Majah and Tirmidhi, highlighting the warnings against seeking knowledge solely for debate or contention.

Crafting a Refutation

I'm now outlining a rebuttal to the unnamed individual's attacks on Aisha, focusing on the repercussions of his actions. I'm crafting an argument about the amplification of the insult and the harm it inflicts. I'm also addressing the danger of public confrontation and the various ways to support the Mother of the Believers, not just through rallies or boycotts.

Formulating Counterarguments

I'm now integrating crucial points from the source material. I'm focusing on the warning against accusing fellow Sunnis of betrayal based on disagreements over defensive methods. I've also incorporated the call for sincerity in defending 'A'ishah, cautioning against political motivations. I'm building a section on self-accountability, addressing a lack of sincerity in outward actions and highlighting problematic behaviors such as rejoicing in a brother's mistakes or interpreting words negatively.

Developing Additional Points

I'm now expanding my list of problematic behaviors to include refusing a brother's repentance and acting as though one is infallible despite theoretical claims of fallibility. These points are now integrated into my argument. I'm also including P183a, a supplication for unity, as a significant point of consideration, and moving on to P184, focusing on the etiquettes of greetings and the implications of the name "Al-Salam".

Analyzing Key Evidence

I'm now carefully examining the hadith cited on boycotting, focusing on the strong warning against prolonged separation as equivalent to shedding blood. I'm also reviewing how "means and ends" applies to the overall strategy. I'm also ensuring the correct transliteration of "Rafidi" and other specific terms, also reviewing the proper translation for "zalla" (slip/mistake), "husn al-zann" (good opinion), and "hajar" (abandonment/boycotting).

I've been meticulously analyzing the translation request, focusing on the specialized role and source material. Specifically, I'm now delving into Salim al-Tawil's Fatawa and articles, paying close attention to the intricate nuances within the Islamic context. The goal is to fully grasp the subject matter's specific terminology and stylistic conventions.

Clarifying Translation Guidelines

I'm solidifying the translation guidelines, focusing on specific Islamic terminology: Aqeedah, Manhaj, Hadith sciences, and Jarh wa Ta'dil. Accuracy remains paramount, with literal translation preferred unless context dictates a meaning-based approach. The importance of preserving isnads, ALA-LC transliteration for narrator names, and the translation of chapter headings, poetry, and verses are being emphasized. I'm confirming the use of "Allah" for "God", handling ﷺ, and ensuring the output is plain text without Arabic characters (except ﷺ). Furthermore, I've clarified the revision process: alignment, context, and transliteration are crucial steps. A key takeaway is to never capitalize chapter headings.

Dissecting Salutations & Greetings

I'm now thoroughly examining the proper translation for "As-Sam 'Alaykum" and related greetings. I'm focusing on the Hadith from Bukhari and Muslim, analyzing the dialogue between the Prophet ﷺ and the Jews, and meticulously noting the nuances of literal versus contextual translation in this situation. The goal is to accurately convey the intended meaning, especially given the derogatory nature of "As-Sam".

Analyzing a Historical Dispute

I'm now fully immersed in the Kuwaiti dispute, specifically the 1996 interaction between Shaykh Rabee' and Shaykh 'Abd al-Rahman. I'm focusing on the Al-Jarh wa al-Ta'dil context, noting how it informs the harsh critiques and counter-critiques that flew back and forth. The dynamics are fascinating, especially Rabee's warm greeting despite the tension. I'm carefully considering how to render book titles and key terms like Jami'yyah for clarity. The events and the leaflet also give me food for thought.

Parsing Key Narrations

I'm presently dissecting the narrative that introduces a new article or fatwa, dedicating it to Abu 'Abdullah 'Abd al-Rahman ibn Sa'd al-Tawil. I'm focusing on the significant Hadith from Sahih Muslim, which includes the story of Uwais al-Qarni. I'm carefully analyzing Usayr ibn Jābir's narration of the delegation from Kufa to 'Umar, and the prophecy concerning Uwais. Furthermore, I'm noting the details surrounding his mother, the white patch, and the request for forgiveness.

Mapping Uwais' Journey

I'm now carefully retracing Uwais' steps as detailed in the narration. The dialogue between 'Umar and the Kufa delegation is fascinating, especially their initial lack of recognition. I'm focusing on the translation of "Ghabra' al-nas" and related terms, and how to best convey the concept of the "shabby house" (Rath al-Bayt) as well as Uwais's status as a reinforcement (Amdad). The nuanced discussion of "Best of the Tabi'in" provides context for understanding Uwais's unique virtue. I've also verified the ALA-LC transliteration of the key names.

Exploring Prison Ministry Details

I'm now fully immersed in the author's reflections on their U.S. visits, particularly focusing on the prison population and the transformative power of Islam. I've noted the significant demographics: the estimated 10 million Muslims in the U.S., with a strong presence of African Americans and converts within the prison system. The author's observation of hardened criminals experiencing a spiritual shift is compelling.

Defining Core Terminology

I'm presently refining the translation of key terms. The "Best of the Tabi'in" requires careful consideration, weighing the nuances of "Successors." I'm reviewing the context for "Ghabra' al-nas" to find an appropriate English equivalent. The translation of the greeting "As-Sam 'Alaykum" is a current focus; the text translates it as "Death," so I'm debating the merits of "Death be upon you" or retaining "As-Sam" with a clarifying bracketed note. I'm also confirming literal translations for "Manhaj" and the title "Al-Badi' fi Manhaj...".

Translating Key Hadith Elements

I'm now carefully rendering the Hadith's essential elements, including Khutbah al-Hajah lines and terms like Jahiliyyah and Da'iyan. I'm also ensuring accurate transliteration per ALA-LC for all narrators, including 'A’ishah, Rabī‘ ibn Hādī al-Madkhalī, 'Abd al-Raḥmān ‘Abd al-Khāliq, Falāḥ ibn Ismā‘īl Mandakār, Usayr ibn Jābir, ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb, Uwais ibn ‘Āmir, Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyib, and Abū ‘Abd Allāh ‘Abd al-Raḥmān ibn Sa‘d al-Ṭawīl. The focus is on clarity and consistency. Finally, I am polishing formatting to match the requirements.

I need to translate plain Arabic to English, keeping IDs intact, and no Arabic script except for ﷺ. Qur'anic verses should be translated in meaning, without Arabic characters, using ALA-LC for narrators (if there were any) but using normal English for other names. I'll make sure to handle details accordingly.

Translating accurately with format considerations
I need to use common spelling for names, avoid diacritics, and omit Arabic script. For God, I'll keep "Allah." I'll translate Surah names, keeping them in transliteration without Arabic. Citations will include the Surah name in brackets and the verse in braces. Islamic terms like "aqeedah" will need careful attention so they reflect an accurate meaning. I'll keep IDs intact.

Translating terms and phrases accurately
I need to translate Islamic terms like "ولي الأمر" as "ruler/guardian of authority" and "طاغوت" carefully. For phrases, "بابا" will be transliterated as "Baba," but I’ll avoid diacritics unless necessary. I'll also accurately translate headings and colloquial phrases, ensuring clarity, like "Swimming in water without getting wet". Keep formatting concise too.

Translating religious text and formatting carefully
For the phrase "ṣallā Allāhu ʿalayhi wa-sallam," I’ll use ﷺ to keep it in line with the guidelines. "Muhammad" will be standard without diacritics, as it's not required. I'll also translate "طيب الله ثراه" as "may Allah sanctify his resting place." Punctuation like “–” will be kept intact, and I'll follow instructions for plain text with no markdown.

Translating and maintaining specific wording and meaning
For P197c and subsequent quotes, I'll carefully translate the text, keeping important phrases like "may Allah have mercy on him" and “Taghut” capitalized. I'll preserve context in descriptions, especially when mentioning the death of Muhammad al-Bouazizi. I'll also ensure clarity in terms like "sadanat al-taghut" and keep all key phrases intact within the quotes.

Translating terms and maintaining context
I’ll focus on translating key phrases like “الغوغائية” to “mob-rule” or “rabble-rousing.” I’ll preserve the essence of both Nabil’s quote and the proverb “kada al-murib an yaqula khuduni” (“The suspicious one nearly says: ‘Catch me’”). For the rest, I’ll make sure everything unfolds with clarity, including the explanation of fatwas and demonstrations.

Clarifying translation choices and tone
I should keep text in plain form, adhering to the idea of no fancy formatting, but line breaks are fine and readable. I'll translate terms like "مشكاة" straightforwardly as "lamp-niche," though tossing in the Arabic word for context might make it overly complex. The passage condemns fatwas that encourage blind authoritarian obedience, equating it with false religious practices. I'll ensure the metaphors and strong language are preserved.

Translating and conveying meaning clearly
The passage denounces those who allowed injustices and tyranny against the Muslim lands, notably the Crusaders' occupation, calling for the liberation of Islam's lands and condemning unjust actions. I’ll translate "الصليبية" as "Crusaders," "اللحية المستعارة" as "borrowed beards," and keep the other terms clear for understanding. The tone is strongly critical of certain ideological figures.

Reflecting on trials and external influences
The passage reminds us of Allah's purpose in creating life and death as trials, using verses like 67:2 and 47:30. It suggests that calamities, even those like Egypt's, expose bad practices and reveal intentions. It touches on the Iranian revolution's impact, particularly the role of religious figures and the spread of ideologies across the region.

Analyzing Egypt's strategic importance and foreign influence
Egypt, with its key location and resources like the Suez Canal, holds significant strategic value. The Iranian revolution seeks influence there due to Egypt's vulnerability, driven by high poverty and unemployment, emotionalism, and historical ties with groups like the Muslim Brotherhood. Some influential figures even called for government change in alignment with these forces.

I need to translate from Arabic to English, keeping IDs like "P215c" intact. I'll do a literal translation unless adjusting for meaning, and use ALA-LC transliteration only for narrators' names. There are no hadith chains, but I'll keep Arabic citations (like رواه مسلم) as they are. I'll translate Qur'an verses and use English names for non-narrators like Bush and Clinton. Surah names will be translated but in Latin letters with diacritics.

Finalizing translation and formatting details
The ALA-LC transliteration is only for narrators' names, but I'll use it for surah names to align with standard practices. Verse translations will be provided, and I’ll keep terms like "Allah" and "Exalted and Most High" as they are. Phrases like "أما بعد" will be preserved, as will the abbreviation ﷺ. I'll transliterate technical terms like “Ahl al-Sunnah” properly, but avoid Arabic characters. I'll carefully finalize the translation without unnecessary uppercase and ensure consistency.

Refining translation instructions
I’ll use "ʿ" for the Arabic "ʿayn" sound and avoid Arabic letters like "أ". Diacritics will be included where needed. Terms like "التقية" will be translated as "taqiyyah", and "المشكاة" as "niche". Qur'anic verses (e.g., 4:59, 6:152) will be translated accurately, and hadith quotes will also be translated into plain text. I'll keep segment IDs exactly (like "P215c - ") and ensure no extra

I'm currently focused on the best approach for translating Salim al-Tawil's fatawa and articles. My thinking centers on accurately conveying the theological nuances while considering the intended audience. I am striving to balance literalness with readability, ensuring the resulting English text is both precise and accessible to those well-versed in Islamic content.

Implementing Translation Protocols

I've been solidifying the translation guidelines for this project. My focus is on achieving high accuracy, prioritizing literal translations, particularly when technical Islamic terms are used. I'm paying close attention to formatting rules like the preservation of narration chains and the application of ALA-LC transliteration for narrator names only. I'm also ensuring that "Allah" is used consistently and have integrated the necessary conventions. Currently I am working through the first pass, focusing on alignment and drafting the initial content.

Analyzing Legal Arguments

I'm currently dissecting the legal arguments presented in the provided text. The key focus is identifying the verses and principles al-Tawil uses to support his points. I'm noting his critique of contemporary approaches, particularly those that deviate from strict Shari'ah implementation, and the concerns over perceived compromises with Western viewpoints. I'm also examining the specific examples al-Tawil cites regarding the consequences of abandoning Islamic law, and how he frames the debate. I'm seeing a shift from general principles to direct engagement with a specific "Dr. of Shari'ah," signaling a more pointed discussion.

Addressing Specific Critiques

I'm now zeroing in on the specific critiques of contemporary approaches to governance and the arguments against certain practices, such as general suffrage and term limits, that deviate from al-Tawil's understanding of Shari'ah. I'm focusing on the examples, like those related to voting and secularism, and how al-Tawil uses them to bolster his points. I'm taking note of how he employs specific verses (e.g., Al-Ma'idah 48) to bolster his claims.

Clarifying Theological Disputes

I'm now fully immersed in the nuances of Al-Tawil's arguments, pinpointing key theological disputes. I'm noting his unwavering stance on Shari'ah's timeless validity, evident in his rebuttal to the idea of adapting laws for bad rulers. He cites Quranic verses, such as Maryam 64, to reinforce his point. I'm also analyzing his critique of specific professors and the perceived deviation from true Islamic principles within Shari'ah education. This includes his concerns over the focus on certain students and the nature of the taught content. I'm focusing on his strong connection to the historical context of the Kuwaiti Shari'ah college and his subsequent criticism of the individuals involved.

Standardizing Islamic Lexicon

I'm now honing in on the specific terminology. I'm focusing on ensuring consistency in the use of terms like Qawanin Wad'iyyah for "man-made laws" and Tahkim al-Shar'. I'm also reviewing how to handle "Ikhwani," generally preferring it untranslated. I'm taking care with proper ALA-LC transliteration of narrator names and am incorporating the specific translations for key verses, like Al-Ma'idah 50, while still aligning with the Arabic. Further polishing the translation of "Ma'ishah danka" is needed. Lastly, I'm ensuring all specific individuals and groups are translated consistently.

Integrating Cultural Context

I'm now carefully integrating the Iranian/Shi'a influence point, and keeping the date "1401 AH." I am deep in the iterative translation, ensuring my wording is precise. I'm paying attention to the specific terms like Hukm and Shara'a. Also, I am ensuring to translate the reference to a woman's unfitness for rule with accuracy, and maintaining the historical context of Kuwait University. Finally, I'm checking that the verse citation typo is addressed, while the final review confirms all constraints are upheld.

I'm currently zeroing in on defining the precise parameters of this translation project. Analyzing the provided context, I've identified the source material as Fatawa (legal rulings) from Salim al-Tawil's website, targeting an audience of Arabic to English readers. This establishes the need for specialized subject expertise.

Analyzing Translation Style

My analysis has solidified. I've pinpointed crucial elements for this translation. The highest accuracy is a must, prioritizing literal translation unless contextual understanding calls for a shift. Key domains demanding expertise are now explicitly defined: Aqeedah, Manhaj, Hadith sciences, and Jarh wa Ta'dil. Strict formatting guidelines are also established: preserving Isnad, ALA-LC for narrator names, "Allah," "ﷺ," plain text, and specific ID retention.

Elaborating Key Concepts

I'm now diving deeper into the nuances of specific Islamic terms and concepts. I'm focusing on defining crucial terms like Kufr Akbar (major disbelief, or outright open disbelief), Fisq (disobedience/immorality), Zulm (oppression), Kufr Asghar (minor disbelief), Millah (creed/fold of Islam), Shawkah (power/strength/thorn), and Fitnah (tribulation). Additionally, I'm examining a pertinent Hadith chain and content related to the Pledge of allegiance, along with the required conditions for rebellion. I am specifically addressing the following question in a draft form: "Some Sharia doctors say rebellion is allowed if we see clear disbelief... what about Tunisia, Libya, Syria?" I need to ensure accuracy and relevance.

Defining Rebellion Conditions

I've been meticulously refining the criteria for permissible rebellion. I've focused on the critical hadith demanding clear disbelief supported by divine proof. The requirement of shawkah, meaning capability to remove the ruler without causing widespread harm, is now explicitly incorporated. Moreover, the purity of intention in raising Allah's word is emphasized, citing relevant verses. In closing, I've clearly affirmed that the absence of even a single condition renders rebellion forbidden.

Scrutinizing Interpretations

My focus has shifted to dissecting the usage of key Islamic principles within specific contexts. I'm examining how Tawheed is employed by different groups, particularly in the case of rebellion. I'm scrutinizing their interpretations of verses like "Fitnah is more severe than killing," comparing the traditional understanding with modern applications. This involves evaluating Al-Sa'dī's tafsir in light of contemporary arguments, aiming for an accurate and balanced perspective.

Analyzing Complex Scenarios

I'm now grappling with the delicate balance between religious principles and real-world consequences. I'm especially focused on the high cost of Muslim blood and the religious and worldly losses that can arise from chaos, such as torture and displacement. I'm exploring the nuances of these issues in the context of specific scenarios.

I'm also preparing for a potential "Mubahalah" (imprecation) challenge with Sh. S. I'm questioning the necessity of this approach, preferring direct advice and confrontation. I've drafted a list of eleven probing questions to address key concerns regarding jihad, rulers, suicide bombings, and donations. I'm currently refining these questions to ensure they are both impactful and relevant to the debate.

Responding to Inquiries

I'm currently formulating responses to inquiries. I'm focusing on crafting a concise and impactful reply to several questions, including those concerning the criticism of others and perceived government bias, promising a detailed response in the next article. I've also begun drafting the opening of the sixth article, expressing gratitude and mentioning the receipt of relevant messages. The forthcoming article is meant to answer the core question of why blame individuals yet absolve governments.

Evaluating Societal Decay

I'm presently evaluating the relationship between societal conduct and governance, exploring the impact of individual actions on the quality of leadership. I'm referencing the hadith on collective shepherdship and the Quranic verses highlighting the consequences of societal actions. I've noted Ibn al-Qayyim's perspective on the direct correlation between people's deeds and their rulers, questioning whether expecting just rulers in a corrupt society is wise, and focusing on the role of individual responsibility in driving reform.

Analyzing Criticisms

I'm now focusing on addressing various criticisms leveled against me. Specifically, I'm responding to accusations and misinterpretations. Regarding accusations of being a spy or lawyer, I'm refuting those claims, pointing out that such labels are merely attempts to discredit my arguments. I'm also highlighting the hadith about harming believers, and emphasizing the importance of remaining respectful even when faced with aggressive criticism. Furthermore, I've drafted a clear declaration of my stance towards the government, emphasizing that I'm neither an opponent nor a traitor. I'm adhering to the methodology of Ahl al-Sunnah, advocating for obedience, prayer, and patience, even while offering advice.

Reconciling Obligations

I'm currently focused on the delicate balance of responsibilities. I am reconciling the obligation to correct erroneous preachers with the obvious condemnation of general vice. The errors of preachers require correction due to their misleading influence on many. I will be prioritizing the need to clarify my approach.

Addressing Critical Points

I'm now integrating the updated terminology and transliterations into the document. I'm ensuring consistency with established formats, like ALA-LC for narrators and proper retention of Arabic terms where appropriate, such as "Kufr Bawāḥ" and "Shawkah." I am currently working to refine the language to ensure all key terms are accurately and appropriately understood.

I'm currently focused on the specific work of Salim al-Tawil. His Kuwaiti Salafi background shapes the style of his fatwas, and the theological nuances are very important. I’m giving serious thought to the need to adapt my approach so the translation properly reflects the intended meaning of the original Arabic. I'm exploring different options for conveying these complex ideas while staying true to the source.

Implementing New Protocols

I've been meticulously refining my approach to align with the protocols. I'm prioritizing high accuracy through literal translation unless context demands a meaning-based shift. I'm now implementing the use of precise Islamic terminology, adhering strictly to the ALA-LC transliteration for narrator names within chains. I'm making sure to consistently use "Allah" for "God" and "ﷺ" for صلى الله عليه وسلم. I've also incorporated a rigorous three-pass review process: alignment, context/accuracy, and transliteration. The goal is to ensure a final product that is both accurate and accessible.

Examining Ethical Boundaries

I'm now fully immersed in the nuances of Al-Hasan Al-Basri's wisdom on judging others. The quote regarding those who find faults versus those who remain silent has struck a chord, leading me to a deeper analysis of the translation drafts. I'm focusing on "awrah" (private matters) and its implications. I've decided on "personal faults" to best capture the meaning in this context. The translation now needs further review.

Delineating Public vs. Private

I am now carefully distinguishing between personal faults and broader doctrinal errors. "Methodological deviations," "creedal misguidances," and "public evils" all demand denouncement and advice. I'm focusing on the ethical lines between these types of errors, recognizing the duty to advise on broader issues. I'm scrutinizing the translation of "Doulah Safawiyyah" in its historical context, particularly the nuances regarding criticism of the Safavid state.

Clarifying Political Nuances

I'm now grappling with the complexities of Sheikh Salim's response to the criticism. The focus is on the Safavid state's political implications and how it relates to broader theological discussions. I'm carefully translating "Western Democracy" in the context of the Sheikh's critiques of specific groups. The exchange underscores the importance of context and nuanced interpretation of political terms within a religious discourse. My next step is to prepare the closing dua.

Finalizing the Conclusion

I have finished translating the closing prayer. I've also completed the seventh article. I focused on staying faithful to the original Arabic while ensuring readability in English. I've included the responses to the messages and the context.

Defining the Essence

Now, I'm examining Sheikh Salim's assertion that the essence of a thing is paramount, not its name. The provided example of "spiritual drinks" (alcohol) and "bank interest" (usury) highlights the danger of deceptive labeling. The translation needs to properly convey the shift from accusations of democracy to its actual implementation, and I'm considering the best way to render terms like "man-made laws," "voting/balloting," and "accountability." My goal is to capture the persuasive force of this argument.

Interpreting Shifting Perspectives

I'm now focusing on the evolving stance of certain contemporary callers. They once condemned those who legislated human-made laws and practiced Western democracy, but are now advocating for similar practices. I'm carefully translating terms like "Takfir" and "millah" to capture the original condemnation, while highlighting the irony of their current position. This necessitates a close examination of "man-made laws," "voting," and "accountability" in this context. I'm aiming to convey the apparent contradiction in their beliefs.

Addressing Modern Slogans

I am now carefully working on translating the slogans. I’m focusing on the context behind slogans like "civil state not religious" and "youth revolution not Islamic". I'm trying to convey the essence of the slogans of national unity and democracy while also staying true to the original text. I'm paying attention to the specific word choices and implications, such as the denouncement of certain slogans that deny religious affiliations. My goal is to capture the underlying sentiment and political implications behind the sloganeering.

Dissecting Slogans of Revolution

I am now focused on dissecting these revolutionary slogans: "O sons of the Muhammadan land", "Explode a renaissance", and "System of masters and slaves". I'm seeing how the Safavid state benefits from instability in the Gulf. The translation draft captures the accusatory tone, highlighting the irony of calls for "renaissance" within a "master-slave" system. I must be precise in my wording so that it highlights the irony of promoting "renaissance" within a "master-slave" system while still staying true to the original text.

Analyzing Revolutionary Rhetoric

I'm currently engaged with the nuances of Sheikh Salim's call for revolution and renaissance. I'm exploring the connotations of phrases like "sons of the Muhammadan land" and "system of masters and slaves" to capture the intended emotional impact. My focus is on the contrast between the stated goals of justice and freedom, and the potential for a "renaissance" under a system of "masters and slaves." I'm working to translate the accusatory and inspiring aspects while keeping the draft true to the original text.

Deciphering Motives

I'm now deeply analyzing Sheikh Salim's characterization of regimes. The goal is to accurately translate the negative implications. I am paying close attention to the accusatory tone concerning the "failure" and "low indicators". I am trying to capture the rhetorical devices, like the ironic contrast between the dream of renaissance and the reality of failure. I must convey the underlying implications, including the supposed link to the Safavid state, and the potential for chaos.

Examining the Core Argument

I'm now wrestling with the core argument regarding Sheikh Salim's retracted statements. My focus is on the principle of Istishab and its application to this specific case. I'm carefully translating the legal maxim, ensuring its correct usage. I'm also considering the implications of 2:160, and how it relates to repentance. The draft is shaping up to reflect both the legal principle of the original state remaining and the need for clear communication regarding any potential retractions.

Clarifying the Critique

I'm presently focusing on the nuances of the critique, ensuring accuracy and fidelity to the Arabic. The translation now carefully distinguishes between criticizing a person's character and addressing their theological errors. I'm prioritizing the emphasis on good character, while also clarifying the need to respond to errors. My aim is to convey both the admiration for the Sheikh's character and the importance of correcting theological deviations. I'm carefully translating the phrase 'what he erred in and'.

Reflecting on Consequences

I'm now carefully rendering the dire consequences of following misguided ideologies. The emphasis on Sheikh Salim's character cannot overshadow the importance of correct understanding. I'm translating the example of the youth who left for Jihad without parental consent, now imprisoned. The translation will highlight the tragedy of this deviation, the brokenhearted parents, and the long-term suffering. I'm focusing on conveying the emotional weight of this outcome.

Conveying Parental Anguish

I'm now carefully translating the poignant account of the parents whose son fell victim to misguided ideology, influenced by Sheikh Salim's fatwa. The translation highlights their intense sorrow and the doctor's failure to consider the consequences of his pronouncements on young people. My focus is to convey the emotional impact of the parents' anguish, emphasizing their concerns about their children's well-being and the importance of parental consent.

Formulating the Rebuttal

I'm now focused on the detailed response to the criticism. The draft accurately translates the question about Jihad, and cites the verses from Al-'Ankabut. I'm prioritizing the importance of a clear answer. The Sheikh's willingness to address the issue in the next article is translated faithfully. The goal is to convey the need for patience and the promise of a complete and thorough response.

Summarizing the Rebuttal

I'm translating the introductory remarks, including the essential praise of Allah and blessings on the Prophet. I'm carefully rendering the Sheikh's promise to address the Jihad question, explaining that he will not evade the topic. I'm focusing on the Sheikh's clarification that the concept of Jihad is broader than perceived, drawing on the Quran's call to "strive against the Kuffar with the Quran". The draft aims to maintain the original Arabic tone.

Broadening Jihad's Scope

I'm translating the extended definition of Jihad. It encompasses all efforts in Allah's obedience, not just combat. I'm focusing on the Quranic verse emphasizing striving through Quranic recitation, not just fighting. I'm careful to ensure the translation emphasizes actions beyond warfare, as the text itself clarifies. The goal is to convey the broader meaning of jihad as intended.

Broadening Jihad's Scope

I'm translating the extended definition of Jihad. I'm focusing on the additional twenty actions from righteous deeds included in the treatise and the reference to "Types of Jihad in the Path of Allah the Exalted Other Than Fighting," which is available on my website. I'm carefully rendering the quote from Ibn Kathir, emphasizing that righteous deeds benefit the doer. The goal is to convey that striving doesn't necessarily involve physical combat.

Clarifying Jihad's Dimensions

I'm now carefully translating Ibn Al-Qayyim's words on jihad. I'm focusing on the connection between striving and divine guidance, highlighting the four key areas: soul, desires, Satan, and the world. The goal is to clearly convey the essential link between internal struggle and attaining Paradise. The importance of repentance as a tool to gain sincerity is also emphasized.

Analyzing Conditions for Jihad

I'm presently focusing on the nuances of the conditions and regulations surrounding Jihad. I'm carefully translating the critique of those who misunderstand Jihad, highlighting the tragic consequences of their actions. I am also making sure to clarify the importance of distinguishing between justified military action and senseless killings of Muslims and non-combatants. The translation will show the importance of the Muslim's state of weakness and how it benefits Muslims. The draft aims to clarify Islam's image from those who misrepresent it.

Reiterating Jihad Principles

I'm now carefully translating the nuanced arguments regarding justified military action and senseless killings. The focus is on the crucial distinction between legitimate defense and the actions of those who misrepresent Islam. I'm prioritizing the emphasis on protecting Muslim lands and resources. The ongoing draft is aimed at clarifying Islam's stance and exposing the harm caused by those who misrepresent it. I'm carefully translating the quote from the Sheikh's book, the goal is to convey that striving doesn't necessarily involve physical combat.

Analyzing Disparities in Fatwas

I'm now carefully rendering the contrast between Rabbani scholars, who unequivocally forbid demonstrations, and partisan callers who encourage them. The translation draft highlights the differing perspectives, emphasizing the Rabbani scholars' concern about the consequences and the partisan callers' apparent hunger for power. The goal is to capture the underlying implications of these contrasting fatwas.

Unmasking Deceptive Rhetoric

I am now focusing on the phrase "callers of chaos who name realities by other than their names." I'm carefully translating the deceptive labels these callers use to describe actions like killing and looting. I'm also attempting to capture the underlying sentiment. I'm exploring how these actions lead to the loss of religion and the empowering of enemies.

Revisiting Historical References

I am now thoroughly immersed in the translation of Sheikh Salim's discourse, specifically focusing on his historical references. I'm carefully translating his depiction of the "Sunni Salafi scholars," highlighting their steadfast adherence to Islamic principles and their aversion to political involvement, democracy, and the prioritization of constitutions over Sharia. The translation will accurately reflect the Sheikh's condemnation of actions that deviate from these principles, particularly in his criticism of rulers, emirs, and the general populace. I am making sure to correctly render the religious advice given by the scholars to rulers and subjects to establish the best message to the public. I'm meticulously translating the verse 4:59, ensuring its proper interpretation within the context of the overall argument.

Revising Contextual Translation

I'm now carefully rendering the verses cited, focusing on preserving the original intent. Verse 42:10 is clarified with a reference to the Quran and Sunnah. Verse 5:50's "judgment of ignorance" is linked to all non-divine ideologies. I'm prioritizing accuracy while maintaining readability for the reader.

Examining Political Systems

I'm presently translating the Sheikh's condemnation of various ideologies like Socialism, Ba'athism, and Democracy. I'm focusing on his strong stance: only Allah's judgment is superior. I'm capturing his warning to rulers about losing power through these systems. The translation is highlighting the deceptive tactics used to install these systems, including the role of international organizations and the tragic consequences.

Focusing on Recent Drafts

I'm now refining the translation of the Sheikh's counsel, emphasizing the dangers posed by advisors and parties. The translated text underscores the need for rulers to judge by Shari'ah according to the Salaf's methodology. The latest draft highlights the dangers of prioritizing ideologies over Islamic principles and calls for vigilance against those with divided loyalties.

Finalizing Translation Principles

I'm finalizing the translation of the phrase "their hearts [hold] hatred more severe than the poison of snakes and scorpions." I'm also reviewing my abbreviation guidelines, now choosing "[Sh. S.]" for Arabic initials. I'm satisfied with "spiritual drinks" and "Jihad of Nafs". I'm also maintaining the idiom "Green and dry" for its accurate meaning.

I need to translate Arabic text into English while keeping IDs intact, and only transliterate the names of narrators in the chain. When it's a chain mention like "رواه البخاري ... عن ابن عباس", I’ll use ALA-LC transliteration for names like Ibn ʿAbbās. I must keep things consistent and avoid translating words not part of the chain.

Handling non-chain names and transliteration
I shouldn’t transliterate non-chain names like Shaykh Muqbil ibn Hādī. For these, I’ll use standard transliterations without diacritics, like Muqbil bin Hadi al-Wadi'i. I should only apply ALA-LC transliteration for names in the narration chain, so I can skip diacritics for scholars or other mentions outside the chain.

Handling transliteration for hadith terms
For chain names, I’ll follow ALA-LC transliteration like Abū Hurayrah, Ibn ʿAbbās, and so on. For non-chain terms like "Irrigation" or "Musāqah" in Bukhari, I can use transliteration with diacritics as needed, keeping in mind diacritical marks are okay. For book titles, I'll use "Book of Irrigation" or similar but avoid Arabic characters.

Translating terms and maintaining format
I’ll avoid using diacritics for technical terms and book titles, and translate them into English, like "Book of al-Musaqah." For verse citations, I should translate the meaning. I’ll preserve chapter headings like "Notice" and "Benefit" without formatting them in all uppercase. IDs, markers, and translations must align, and include the necessary citation at the end.

Translating sensitive terms and ensuring clarity
For this task, I’ll avoid using any Arabic characters, including Quranic verses, by translating them (e.g., "Luqman 31:15" instead). I'll translate specific phrases like "الحمد لله" and "صلى الله عليه وسلم" as "Allah's praise" and " ﷺ" while keeping "Allah" instead of "God" unless referring to "ilah." For technical terms, I’ll preserve terms like "manhaj" and translate others carefully. Citations will appear at the end.

Summarizing and clarifying key points
This section discusses the obligation to obey rightful rulers, highlighting actions of Shaykh Muqbil b. Hadi al-Wadi'i and the development of Salafi Sunni da’wah in Dammaj, Yemen. It also addresses the media silence during the siege, and the commentary about Shaykh Uthman b. Muhammad al-Khamis’s perspective on amir and obedience.

Clarifying statements around political opinions and obedience
The discussion involves the speaker addressing statements about not considering Shaykh Nasir al-Muhammad as their wali al-amr and clarifying misunderstandings. They stress that the call for demonstrations and opposition to the amir was misinterpreted. The speaker explains the importance of obedience to appointed officials, consistent with the Sunnah.

Addressing political discontent: patience over protest
The speaker emphasizes that regardless of government corruption, Sunnah calls for patience, adherence to authority, and avoiding reactionary actions like demonstrations or innovation. It’s important to confront wrongdoing with truth and follow established practices. The advice from scholars includes self-reform, repentance, and holding onto unity despite injustices.

Clarifying obedience and political authority
The speaker questions the notion of obeying only one ruler, pointing to modern scholars' interpretation of verses on obedience to both rulers and scholars. They emphasize the importance of kindness in obedience, even when rulers are unjust, and warn against violence or disruptive actions. Unity comes from supporting rulers in good and advising them against evil.

Translating and ensuring accuracy with terminology
The speaker mentions how even if a leader is seen as kafir, obeying in good and lawful ways is essential. Moving onto a quote from Dr. Nabil al-Awadi about the unexpected outcomes of uprisings, we'll translate and translate terms carefully, keeping technical words intact like "wali al-amr"and "fitan"and removing Arabic punctuation or invisible characters.


I need to translate the Arabic text to English, keeping the segment IDs intact and excluding all Arabic characters except ﷺ. Citations should be included as plain text at the beginning or end, using ALA-LC transliteration for names of narrators. I'll make sure to follow the user’s preference for plain text only.

Translating names and handling transliteration
This text doesn’t have isnaads (chains) except for references to figures like Moses and Abraham. The guideline seems to only require ALA-LC transliteration for narrators directly in the chain. For other names, I’ll use common English forms and avoid diacritics, unless it's something still under transliteration rules.

Handling transliteration and citations
To stay safe, it’s best to avoid using diacritics for non-narrator names, sticking to common English transliterations like "Saleh al-Luhaidan" instead of "Ṣāliḥ al-Luhaydan." For Quranic verses, I'll avoid Arabic characters, using English transliteration for surah names like [al-Qamar] instead, but without diacritics for consistency.

Translating Surah names and handling commentary
For Surah names like "الحجرات", I'll use transliterations like "al-Hujurat" without diacritics, as they’re not narrators. I'll also translate headings like "التعقيب الثاني" as "Second Commentary." Since some content, like a poem, is missing, I’ll only provide the available text and leave out any missing parts. I'll check the full file for text continuation.

Translating and Aligning Segments
I’ll ensure that all segments are translated while preserving the IDs like "P229a -". I'll render phrases like "أقول" as "I say:". For proper titles, "الشيخ العلامة صالح اللحيدان" will become "the shaykh, the erudite scholar Salih al-Luhaydan—may Allah preserve him." I’ll use common English terms for technical phrases like "creed," "manhaj," and "Rafidi," avoiding Arabic characters.

Handling Terminology and Translations
They’ve asked to keep Islamic technical terms, so we'll use terms like "tawhid," "shirk," and "bid'ah," even if not explicitly mentioned. For "wahdat al-wujud," I’ll go with "the unity of existence" and include the transliteration in parentheses. I’ll also use "the Muslim Brotherhood" for "الإخوان المسلمين" and "shura" for "الشورى," explaining it as "shar'i consultation." Translations for Quranic excerpts will be literal and in English.

Translating Quranic Verses
For the verses, I’ll include translations with verse numbers but won’t quote the Arabic. For example, the first verse: "Indeed, We created everything with a decree." (54:49). Another: "Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most God-fearing of you." (49:13). For longer verses, like 24:55, I'll use a full, accurate translation, ensuring clear wording. I'll also handle verse 10:32, translating: "So what is there after the truth except misguidance?"

Translating Quranic Verses and Phrases
For Qasas 28:5-6, I’ll translate the excerpt as: "And We intended to show favor to those who were oppressed in the land, and to make them leaders, and to make them inheritors, and to establish them in the land." The full verse also mentions Pharaoh and his soldiers, but I’ll stick to the provided portion.

For Baqarah 2:124, I’ll render it as: "Indeed, I am making you an imam for the people." I’ll also translate the standard phrases like "الحمد لله رب العالمين" and ensure "صلى الله عليه وسلم" is written as ﷺ, especially for Muhammad ﷺ.

Lastly, the phrase "وصلى الله وسلم" will translate to "and may Allah send prayers, peace, and blessings upon our Prophet Muhammad and upon his family and his Companions."

Translating Terms and Formatting Guidelines
For "وصلى الله وسلم وبارك", I don’t need to use ﷺ, as it doesn’t explicitly contain "صلى الله عليه وسلم". Instead, I’ll translate it as: "and may Allah send prayers, peace, and blessings upon our Prophet Muhammad."

For instructions about formatting, I’ll make sure chapter headings are in lowercase and translate terms like "التعقيب الثاني" as "the second comment." Also, "انتهى كلامه بحروفه. [المصدر]" becomes "End of his statement, verbatim. [Source]." For certain quotes, like "رافضياً", I’ll follow the given terms for consistency.

I'll use line breaks and hyphens instead of bullets for lists and keep it in plain text, as requested. I'll also translate "ملاحظة مهمة جداً" as "A very important note."

Translating Key Phrases
For tricky phrases like "ما من شيء إلا وهو بقدر الله عز وجل," I'll translate it as: "There is nothing except that it is by Allah's decree."

For "بقدر الله الكوني": "by Allah's creational decree" fits as the translation. For "شرعيَّة الشيء من عدمه," it will become "the legality of a matter (in the Shari'ah) or otherwise," and for "حسنه من قبحه," it’s "its goodness or its ugliness."

I’ll handle "بمقتضى الأدلة الشرعية" as "by virtue of the shar'i evidences" and "مصيباً ومرضياً" as "correct and pleasing to Allah."

For "شرار الخلق,” I’ll go with "the worst of creation," and for "لا يخفى على من له أدنى بصر وبصيرة," I’ll say "It’s not hidden from anyone with the slightest sight and insight."

"Sدة الحكم" I'll translate as "the seat of rule." Lastly, for "ومن هنا تعرف", I'll work on the translation from al-Luhaydan to keep it coherent.

Translating Key Terms and Phrases
In this translation, I’ll refer to "المرشد" as "the Guide" or "the General Guide" (murshid). For "المسيرة ينبغي أن تكون إسلامية," I'll translate it as "the march/path ought to be Islamic" with their allowance for alliances with others like Rafidi.

For "الصوفية المغرقة," I will use "excessive Sufism."

"شيخ المشايخ في مصر" I’ll translate as "the Shaykh of Shaykhs" or head of Sufi orders.

"Mashyakha" will be translated to "a shaykhdom," as in "the shaykhdom of al-Azhar and the shaykhdom of Sufism."

For "شناعة," I’ll go with "an abomination."

"تصوف ابن عربي المعروف" is translated as "the well-known Sufism of Ibn Arabi."

Handling technical terms and translation details
When translating P229e, I will address the mention of democracy as misguidance and translate relevant verses. For P229g, I'll keep the discussion about martyrdom in relation to Islam and fighting for it.

For technical terms like "aqeedah" (creed) and "manhaj" (methodology), I'll use their transliterations in Latin script, following the instructions. I’ll avoid Arabic letters, as the user requested.

In P229j, I’ll translate key concepts like "الدكتاتورية" (dictatorship) and "إسلامهم ودينهم" (their Islam and religion), ensuring clarity. I'll also include explanatory details, like "ما ظهر منها وما بطن" (what is apparent and hidden).

Also, for the section in P231a, everything including "شرك أكبر" (major shirk) and “فلله الأمر من قبل ومن بعد” (To Allah belongs the command before and after) will be translated accurately. Lastly, "إليك أخي القارئ البرهان" (Here, my dear reader, is the proof) will be translated carefully too.

I need to translate Arabic segments to English with accuracy, keeping the IDs intact and only using transliteration for narrator names from the chain, like Ibn ʿUmar, al-Nuʿmān ibn Bashīr, and others. I won’t use transliteration for the text, but I’ll apply it for the narrators, including for Aḥmad, Abū Dāwūd, etc.

Transliteration for narrators only
When there's an isnad like "قال النعمان بن بشير ... عن النبي", I should use ALA-LC transliteration for the names of narrators in the chain, such as al-Nuʿmān ibn Bashīr. For other names like Dr. Nabil or Salim, I shouldn’t transliterate them with ALA-LC. Instead, I can stick to standard English transliteration.

Transliteration for non-narrators
The instruction specifies ALA-LC transliteration only for narrators in the chain, so for other names like "ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ʿAbd al-Khāliq" (a modern scholar), I shouldn't use ALA-LC with diacritics. Instead, I'll use simplified romanization without diacritics, like "Abd al-Rahman Abd al-Khaliq" or "Nabil al-Awadhi."

Translating correctly and preserving references
For names, I’ll use standard academic transliteration without diacritics unless they're narrators in a chain, for which I'll apply ALA-LC. “الله” should be translated as “Allah,” and “إله” as “god.” For Qur'anic verses, I’ll translate everything and omit any written Arabic except the ﷺ, while keeping the bracketed references intact. I also need to remember to cite sources appropriately.

Handling translation and transliteration choices
For terms like "ʿaqīdah," I’m leaning towards keeping the Arabic term in transliteration alongside the translation ("creed") to preserve its technical meaning. It’s not part of the isnad, so it’s not strictly against the rules. The year and month should be translated, like “9 Dhū al-Ḥijjah 1432 AH” with diacritics, as long as it’s not Arabic script.

Translating technical terms in Islamic content
For terms like "ʿaqīdah," "manhaj," and "irjāʾ," it’s better to translate them into English, such as "creed" and "methodology." "Irjāʾ" might be translated as “the doctrine of Murji'ism,” which avoids using Arabic script but includes some transliteration. The instructions seem to allow for technical terms to be translated with parentheses providing transliteration.

Translating technical terms and maintaining clarity
For "tawḥīd al-ḥākimiyyah," I should translate it as "what he called tawḥīd of governance (al-ḥākimiyyah)" with diacritics, but without Arabic characters. The term "tawhid" is standard and can be used, as long as it's not in the context of narrators' names. For other technical terms like "tawhid," "monotheism" can be used, but "tawhid" preserves more nuance.

Translating terms and handling citations
I need to decide on transliterating terms like "tawhid" (without diacritics), as using "tawḥīd" would follow ALA-LC, but they didn’t specify that. For "shirk," I'll write it like that without ALA-LC. For phrases like "الله أكبر", I'll translate literally, and for Hadiths and Qur’an verses, I'll include references, keeping text plain. I'll add citation references accordingly while sticking to "no formatting."

Integrating citation properly
I'm planning to include the citation inline at the end of the last sentence, like this: "and upon his family and his Companions altogether. (website)". This way it fits the format required, though I've seen some different instructions. I'll follow this approach and revise the translation as needed.

Translating poem and quotes with care
I need to match the exact formatting for translations, like maintaining segment identifiers (P231c). The poetry translation should flow naturally, like "O phantom of my poetry, give al-Banna glad tidings in his grave of his most radiant light." For phrases like "shirk with Allah" and "an assault upon tawhid," I’ll stick to formal yet clear translations.

Translating quotes and addressing contradictions
The author references several religious quotes and asks hard questions. I must ensure the quotes are translated clearly, like translating “ركبوا وسيلةً” as “to mount a means,” while being careful with references like “sallallahu alayhi wa sallam” (ﷺ). Additionally, contradictions are explored, especially regarding democracy vs. dictatorship, using hadiths and Quranic verses.

I'm currently focused on the specific context of translating Islamic content from Arabic to English, particularly materials originating from Salim al-Tawil's website. My immediate task involves precisely analyzing this particular request and identifying the critical elements relevant to my professional role.

Establishing Translation Guidelines

I've solidified the essential principles and protocols for this translation project. Accuracy is paramount, leaning towards a direct translation style unless nuances demand a more interpretive approach. I've pinpointed key terminology that requires meticulous handling, and established rigid formatting rules to ensure consistency and fidelity. Specifically, I'm now drafting the guidelines for how to translate the first segment (P240).

Investigating Legal Nuances

I'm now delving into the legal intricacies presented within the material. The analysis touches upon Dr. Nabil Al-Awadi's views, specifically his criticism of Salafis, labeling them "Murji'ah of the Era." I'm carefully considering the hadith about burden of proof, its varying narrations, and its applicability in this context, including the story of the two women. I'm focusing on accurately representing legal terms like biyyinah and yameen, striving for literal translations where feasible, while maintaining readability.

Refining Terminology Choices

I'm now carefully navigating terminology within the translation of this segment, starting with the phrase "Subhanaka." I'm also carefully handling the translation of "Irja'," recognizing its multifaceted interpretations and historical context. I'm focusing on providing more clarity for the user as they view the translation of each point, in the context of the criticism. Specifically, I'm now drafting the guidelines for how to translate segment P240c.

Clarifying Takfiri Logic

I'm now focusing on the nuances of the Takfiri arguments, specifically regarding their interpretations of governance and societal participation. Analyzing segments P240d, P240e, and P240f, I'm carefully unpacking the logical fallacies within their rhetoric, especially their views on rulers and their application of the term "Murji'ah." I'm particularly interested in how they extend their exclusionary views to democracy and elections, and the implications of this for Dr. Nabil Al-Awadi's position. My aim is to accurately convey these complex arguments in a way that is both precise and understandable, while shedding light on the underlying ideological premises.

Analyzing Takfiri Claims

Currently, I'm focusing on the Takfiri extremists' views on rulers, specifically their assertion that rulers are disbelievers. I'm exploring Dr. Nabil Al-Awadi's claims regarding Salafis' positions on Gaddafi and Ben Ali, noting the refutations presented. I'm carefully translating and analyzing segment P240g, which involves a strong denial and accusation of lying. Furthermore, segment P240h presents additional evidence for proof against the claims.

Analyzing Takfiri Claims

Now, I'm analyzing the Takfiri extremists' views on rulers, specifically their assertion that rulers are disbelievers. I'm exploring Dr. Nabil Al-Awadi's claims regarding Salafis' positions on Gaddafi and Ben Ali, noting the refutations presented. I'm carefully translating and analyzing segment P240i. I'm noting the personal aspect to the claims being made, and considering how the behavior of those who cannot refute someone on a scientific level. I'm reviewing the twenty-first comment, and its discussion of forbidding protests, introducing fatwas from major scholars.

Analyzing Scholar Opinions

I'm now focusing on Al-Albani and Uthaymin's perspectives on demonstrations. Their views, as reflected in the translated quotes, emphasize the imitation of non-Muslim practices and the potential for chaos. I'm carefully translating and analyzing segment P240k, which introduces Al-Albani's quote, and the subsequent segment P240l, which features Uthaymin's views. I'm paying attention to how these fatwas relate to the overall argument and its context.

Translating Scholarly Views

I'm now progressing to translate the opinions of various scholars regarding demonstrations. I've translated quotes from Al-Uthaymin, Muhammad Hamid al-Fiqi, and Muqbil bin Hadi al-Wadi'i, focusing on their specific warnings and reasons for prohibiting protests, and the source segments P240m, P240n, and P240o. I'm carefully analyzing the nuances of their arguments, paying close attention to the source materials' implications.

Assessing Demonstration Fatwas

I'm now diving into the implications of the fatwas. They're presented as absolute pronouncements against demonstrations, without exceptions for any ruler or circumstance. There's a new article regarding Hamid al-'Ali on the horizon. I'm focusing on the "absolute" nature of these pronouncements. Now, I'm carefully analyzing the source segment P240p, which is a caution against peaceful protests, as there are no such things. I'm moving on to a new article (P241) on Abdul-Rahman Abdul-Khaliq's position, and his interview in Al-Watan newspaper.

Refuting Accusations Thoroughly

My focus is on the strong rebuttal launched against the claims, particularly those leveled at Ansar al-Sunnah regarding grave destruction, as found in segments P241a and P241b. I'm carefully analyzing the source materials for these claims, examining the arguments made, and considering how the evidence from the Quran is relevant to the debate. I'm also carefully considering the specific counter-arguments related to governance and ruler's permissions.

Addressing Accusations Critically

Now, I'm focusing on the pointed critiques within the exchange. The arguments touch upon the permissibility of revolting against rulers for worldly corruption. I'm carefully translating and analyzing segment P241c, which critiques the actions of allowing revolts against rulers for worldly corruption. I'm now also looking into segment P241d, which criticizes how politics has "corrupted" someone, and the concept of shirk and its comparison to oppression. I'm now working to translate segment P241e.

Examining Infallibility Claims

I'm now focusing on Abdul-Rahman Abdul-Khaliq's reluctance to admit error, contrasting this with his apology to Bin Baz as cited by Saad al-Husayn. I'm carefully translating and analyzing segment P241f, which includes the claim of infallibility, and the contrasting refutation. I'm working to translate the Arabic phrase "...the Sheikh 'Abd al-Rahman 'Abd al-Khaliq hardly acknowledges a mistake of his..."

Identifying Key Terminology

I'm presently zeroing in on core terminology and proper names that demand meticulous transliteration and accurate translation. Specifically, I'm focusing on Wali Amr which I've translated as Guardian/Ruler or legitimate ruler depending on context, and phrases like Jarh wa Ta'dil. I've refined the transliteration of prominent figures, including Al-Awadi, Al-Albani, and Bin Baz, ensuring adherence to ALA-LC standards. Furthermore, I've confirmed that the text specifically links democracy to extremists' perceptions.

Standardizing Proper Nouns

I'm now fully immersed in ensuring consistency with ALA-LC transliteration standards. I've standardized all proper nouns across the text, including figures like 'Ajīl al-Nashmī, Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhāfī, Zayn al-'Ābidīn, Muḥammad Nāṣir al-Dīn al-Albānī, Muḥammad ibn Ṣāliḥ al-'Uthaymīn, Muḥammad Ḥāmid al-Fīqī, Muqbil ibn Hādī al-Wādi'ī, Ḥāmid 'Abd Allāh al-'Alī, 'Abd al-Raḥmān 'Abd al-Khāliq, and Sa'd ibn 'Abd al-Raḥmān al-Ḥuṣayn. I've also clarified the application of ALA-LC. I am being careful to maintain the ALA-LC transliteration on the names of narrators in the chain but not the textual content, and to preserve the full chains of narration.

Implementing Transliteration Protocols

I'm now implementing the established transliteration protocols. While I've standardized names across the board, adhering to ALA-LC for narrators within the chains of narration remains a priority. I'm carefully maintaining English spellings for modern figures unless they appear within a hadith chain. The goal is to maximize clarity and precision in accordance with the specified guidelines.

Revising Transliteration Standards

I'm now revising my transliteration process for consistency, adhering strictly to ALA-LC, particularly for narrators and scholars mentioned within chains of narration. I will provide precise transliteration for those names, meeting the professional standard for "Islamic content" as outlined in my task. I'm noting specific verses referenced, including 2:206, 3:77, 21:58, 17:81, and 31:13 to ensure accuracy and context. I've reconfirmed the translation of terms like "Murji'at al-'Asr," "Tawaghit," and "Wali Amr Shar'i."

Addressing Claims Methodically

I'm presently focusing on the arguments presented within segment P241e, specifically the critical commentary on Abdul-Rahman Abdul-Khaliq's position. I'm carefully translating and analyzing the claim regarding his reluctance to admit error, as well as the contrasting views from Saad al-Husayn, ensuring accuracy and precision. I'm meticulously considering the methodological points, paying close attention to the evidence used to refute those claims. I'm also ensuring the hadith from Daraqutni is translated, paying special attention to the words "Biyyinah is on the claimant, and the Oath (Yameen) is on the one who denies".

I think I need to stick to ALA-LC transliteration for narrators’ names in hadith chains, like "Ibn ʿUmar" and "Abū Hurayrah." For names outside the chain, I can leave them in natural English or romanization. I'll skip transliterating initials, like "ح. ح. ع".

Using ALA-LC and romanization for names
I need to stick to using ALA-LC for names of narrators in the chain, and for others, I can use standard English transliteration without diacritics. For example, "ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ʿAbd al-Khāliq" becomes "Abd al-Rahman Abd al-Khaliq." I'll also make sure to translate "Allah" as "Allah" and use "God" only when appropriate.

Translating Qur'anic verses and references in hadith
For "لا إله إلا الله", I'll translate it as "there is no ilāh but Allah" — keeping it clear and accurate. For the Qur'anic verses in brackets, I'll translate them, but I'll likely keep verse numbers and references like [البقرة] as transliterated names in English, like "[al-Baqarah]," and say "narrated by Muslim" for hadith sources. ALA-LC applies to narrators, not sources, so no need for ALA-LC on them.

Translating hadith terms carefully
For collectors, I'm going to use standard forms like "al-Bukhari" without diacritics, but I'll keep specific terms like "isnād" and "ḥasan" with diacritics since they're technical terms. Arabic characters will be avoided, but diacritics in Latin are fine. I'll ensure correct translations for things like "apostasy" ("الردة" as "ridda") as directed. I'll deliver the final version after reviewing three times.

Handling citations, Arabic characters, and translation conventions
I’ll include the citation at the end but avoid markdown as per the user’s request. Arabic characters will be limited to ﷺ. As for the supplication “صلى الله وسلم وبارك على نبينا محمد,” I'll use "Muhammad" without diacritics since it's part of the matn, not a narrator name. I'll keep the original segmentation and headings intact while translating them correctly.

Handling key translation details
In the matn, I’ll use "Muhammad" without diacritics since it's not part of the narrator chain. "Muḥammad" will appear in the chain, as advised. When translating Quranic verses or hadith, I’ll preserve meaning while being mindful of terms like taqwā and fiqh terms. Technical terms like "ḥijāmah" will have transliterations with diacritics, but no Arabic script.

Translating technical terms with clarity
I'll use transliterations with diacritics for terms like "ḥijāmah" and "istiḥāḍah," but ensure no Arabic script. When translating things like "السواك" to "siwāk" or "البخور" to "incense," I'll make sure to explain concepts clearly. For medical terms like "insulin shot," I'll use "insulin injection." Similarly, I’ll carefully translate terms like "gargling" and phrases related to pregnancy.

Summarizing fasting guidelines and key issues
For fasting during Ramadan, there are a few important points: intention must be made at night unless there’s a break for illness or travel. Breaking fast should ideally be with dates or water. Fasting is invalidated by smoking, and prayer abandonment invalidates fast as well. Important hadith cites should be included.

Translating key points about fasting and prayer customs
Fasting in Ramadan is a duty for faith and reward, not for show. If someone deliberately breaks their fast, they must repent and cannot substitute it with past fasting or expenditures. Regarding intercourse during the day, expiation is required. Also, the phrase “صلى الله عليه وسلم” translates as "and may Allah send prayers and blessings upon him ﷺ."

Translating key elements and respecting guidelines
I'll translate the newspaper name and date and keep them as they are. For things like "naṣūḥan", it's allowed to use Latin letters with diacritics, as it's not Arabic script. For the initials "Dr. H. ʿ.", I'll stick to "Dr. H. A." to avoid violating the no-Arabic-letter rule, making sure it respects the anonymity. I'll also translate quotes and include the Quran verse (4:59) in parentheses.

P215b - الله اكبر، تأمل اخي القارئ هذا الهجوم الشرس الذي شنه الدكتور على العلماء! فلقد صبَّ جامَ غضبه على العلماء دون ان يستثني منهم احدا وحمّلهم كل بليّة في الأمة وهذا كما لا يخفى يؤدي إلى إسقاطهم من أعين الناس، كما لا يخفى على من له مسحة من عقل بأنه تنفير وتشكيك وطعن ظاهر، بل لا نبعد عن الحقيقة إذا قلنا إنه تكفير لهم - والعياذ بالله - وفي الوقت الذي يصف فيه نفسه ومن معه بأنهم علماء! فأين هؤلاء من قوله صلى الله عليه وسلم: «لَيْسَ مِنْ أُمَّتِي مَنْ لَمْ يُجِلَّ كَبِيرَنَا وَيَرْحَمْ صَغِيرَنَا وَيَعْرِفْ لِعَالِمِنَا حَقَّهُ «[رواه أحمد عن عبادة بن الصامت- حديث: ‏22164‏، وقال الهيثمي في مجمع الزوائد (8/ص 14) رواه أحمد والطبراني وإسناده حسن]، وفي رواية كما وردت عند الحاكم [حديث: ‏381‏]: «ليس منا من لم يبجل كبيرنا، ويرحم صغيرنا ويعرف لعالمنا حقه»، فإن قال لا اقصد علماء السنة فأقول: هذا ما نرجوه لكن يجب عليك بيان ذلك بيانا شافيا حتى لا تتهم بأنك طعنت بالعلماء الربانيين المعروفين بالفضل والاستقامة.
وهكذا لم تستثن أحدا عندما واصلت قولك بالحرف الواحد: (إن هؤلاء العلماء لا يحفظون من كتاب الله إلا قوله تعالى (يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آَمَنُوا أَطِيعُوا اللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُوا الرَّسُولَ وَأُولِي الْأَمْرِ مِنْكُمْ) وخالطوهم في مجالسهم وركنوا إليهم ولبسوا الحق بالباطل فأحلوا لهم الدخول في دين الكفار والسير في ركاب اليهود والنصارى والمجوس والمنافقين تحت رايات وشعارات متنوعة وأخرى تحت شعار مكافحة الإرهاب وثالثة تحت شعار سماحة الإسلام حتى أصبحت الأمة بلا هوية توالي أعداءها وتسير على خطاهم وتتبنى مناهجهم) انتهى كلامه.

Handling ellipses in translation
The ellipses represent omitted text in the original, so I’ll preserve them in the translation to show the truncation. For example, “الد...” becomes "Dr. ...," and “إن هؤلاء ال...” can be translated as "these schol..." to match the ellipsis. I'll keep the translation aligned while respecting the original format.

Considering ellipses and accuracy
Since the user wants high accuracy, I should preserve the ellipses to reflect the truncation but not infer what’s missing. I’ll translate the visible parts and include the ellipses in the same spots as in the original. I’ll also check P215a to see if there are any ellipses to account for.

Counting ellipses in translation segments
import re
segments=[]
for seg in ["P215a","P215b"]:
    s=text.find(seg)
    e=text.find("\nP215b", s) if seg=="P215a" else len(text)
    print(seg, text[s:e].count("..."))

P215a 0
P215b 0
Double-checking ellipsis handling
I’m thinking that P215b counts as 0 because the ellipsis might be represented differently ("...") or encoded differently ("…"). When I saw "الد..." with Arabic letters, it might have been truncated by Python’s print, causing issues. I’ll check for hidden characters like '\u2026' to confirm.

Checking for ellipsis character presence
# Check for ellipsis char
print("u2026 count", text.count("\u2026"))
print("three dots count", text.count("..."))

u2026 count 0
three dots count 0
Investigating terminus truncation
I’m trying to figure out why the console printed "..." instead of the full ellipsis. It looks like Python might truncate overly long outputs, replacing the middle with "...". Let me search and slice around "الد" to see the actual characters and confirm if there's just a long line being collapsed.

'الدكتور على العلماء! فلقد صبَّ جامَ غضبه على العلماء دون ان يستثني منهم احدا وحمّلهم كل بليّة في الأمة وهذا كما لا يخفى '
Identifying truncation points
Okay, no ellipsis in the actual content. The "الد...ا" earlier was likely caused by output truncation from the system. The same thing happened with "إن هؤلاء ال...". I should find the full text by locating "إن هؤلاء العلماء" and checking the exact content in the longer sequence.

Inspecting truncation with repr
The system has truncated the output again with "…". To see the actual substring, I'll inspect the surrounding text by slicing and using repr for a limited length. By printing 250 characters, I should be able to view the full content without any truncation, since this length likely avoids the issue.

Inspecting truncated output with repr method
print(repr(seg[idx2:idx2+450]))

'إن هؤلاء العلماء لا يحفظون من كتاب الله إلا قوله تعالى (يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آَمَنُوا أَطِيعُوا اللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُوا الرَّسُولَ وَأُولِي الْأَمْرِ مِنْكُمْ) وخالطوهم في مجالسهم وركنوا إليهم ولبسوا الحق بالباطل فأحلوا لهم الدخول في دين الكفار والسير في ركاب اليهود والنصارى والمجوس والمنافقين تحت رايات وشعارات متنوعة وأخرى تحت شعار مكافحة الإرهاب وثالثة تحت شعار سماحة الإسلام حتى أصبحت الأمة بلا هوية توالي أعداءها وتسير على خطاهم وتتبنى مناهجهم) ا'
Exploring truncation and alternatives
The system is still truncating the output with ellipses. To get the exact content, I'll consider splitting around known markers or printing by encoding. Alternatively, I could write the content to a file and read it in smaller chunks. I’ll start by printing smaller segments to avoid truncation.

Extracting exact substring without truncation
chunk=seg[idx2:idx2+220]
print(chunk)

إن هؤلاء العلماء لا يحفظون من كتاب الله إلا قوله تعالى (يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آَمَنُوا أَطِيعُوا اللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُوا الرَّسُولَ وَأُولِي الْأَمْرِ مِنْكُمْ) وخالطوهم في مجالسهم وركنوا إليهم ولبسوا الحق بالباطل فأحلوا له
Investigating Arabic truncation in file
The truncation issue within parentheses might be due to the display handling of Arabic text. I'll investigate by checking the raw file and its bytes directly. If there are ellipses within the file, these may indicate omitted parts. I'll focus on extracting the substring between the parentheses to confirm.

Extracting text between parentheses in chunk
import re
m=re.search(r"\(([^)]*)\)", chunk)
m.group(1)[:100], len(m.group(1))

('يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آَمَنُوا أَطِيعُوا اللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُوا الرَّسُولَ وَأُولِي الْأَمْرِ مِنْكُمْ',
 100)
Fixing truncation with regex extraction
It looks like the truncation happened because the chunk I worked with ended before the closing parenthesis. Since the verse might be longer, I’ll use regex to capture everything up to the closing parenthesis from the original segment. That should give a more complete view of the verse.

Extracting verse from Arabic text using regex
m=re.search(r"قوله تعالى \(([^)]*)\)", seg)
print(m is not None)
verse=m.group(1)

It looks like the verse in the file is truncated intentionally, with the ellipsis "..." acting as a placeholder after "يَا أَيُ...". The actual verse continues beyond that, but the file might have replaced part of it. I’ll check if the verse contains those ellipses as part of the deleted content.

Checking for ellipses in verse string
"." in verse, verse.find(".")

(False, -1)
Understanding output truncation and extracting verse
It looks like there was no ellipsis in the file itself—just a truncation issue when output tools try to display text longer than a certain length. The proper verse is intact and accessible programmatically, even if the visual output shortened it. I can extract and display it per line to avoid further truncation.

Preparing translation and formatting text
I have the full content now, which is great! I’ll translate accurately and reference the file properly using a citation. Since there shouldn't be any Arabic characters, I’ll replace the guillemets with standard English quotes for clarity and follow the agreed formatting rules. This should keep things clear and consistent.

Ensuring proper translation formatting
I'll make sure to convert all Arabic references into their English transliterations, like [البقرة] to [al-Baqarah]. For Quranic verses, I'll replace Arabic script with their English translation while preserving surah names and verse numbers in brackets. I’ll also ensure that no Arabic letters remain in the final output and translate hadiths.

Considering hadith translation and transliteration
I’ll translate phrases like "يا باغي الخير أقبل، ويا باغي الشر أقصر" to English, including the footnotes like "[narrated by Muslim—hadith no. 21]." In P215b, I’ll translate and reproduce the Arabic quotes, while maintaining the admonitions and corrections. For narrators, I’ll use proper transliterations with diacritics, such as Ibn ʿUmar and Abū Hurayrah. I’ll apply this consistently across hadith references.

Translating and applying chain style
When translating hadith, phrases like "may Allah be pleased with him" should be used following the name of the narrator, such as Abū Hurayrah or Ibn ʿUmar. Similarly, "From Abū Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, from the Prophet ﷺ..." will be used for proper narration format. I'll consistently apply transliteration for narrator names, ensuring clarity and respect for the tradition. I’ll avoid Arabic script in non-chain contexts.

Ensuring consistency in formatting and translation
I'll make sure to keep narrator names consistent in citations, even if not part of the chain. For terms like Qur'an, Ramadan, and Islam, I'll apply diacritics. Numeric markers like "P214e" need to remain, and I'll preserve segment headings and enumerations. Plain text will include line breaks, but no markdown—lists will be separated by new lines or semicolons. Keeping it simple and formatted correctly!

Ensuring accurate translation of religious terms
I need to include the citation at the end of the translation. For terms like "المفطرات المتفق عليها," I'll translate carefully, making sure not to use direct transliterations when possible. I'll ensure key terms like "adhān" and specific phrases like "Tarek al-Salat Kafir" are translated correctly while maintaining their religious significance.

Finalizing translation conventions
To maintain consistency, I’ll translate phrases like "صلى الله عليه وسلم" as "Muhammad ﷺ" and "Messenger of Allah ﷺ.” I’ll also replace Arabic script with transliterated terms like “Ramaḍān" and “Ṣaḥīḥ," using diacritics. "Iman" will be transliterated or translated directly as “faith.” I'll apply these conventions urgently for accuracy.

Balancing transliteration and translation preferences
I am trying to balance literal translations with technical terms, so I'll use English for most, but add transliterations in parentheses for certain terms like "īmān" or "iḥtisāban." For book titles like "Majmaʿ al-Zawāʾid," I'll likely avoid ALA-LC and go for "Majma' al-Zawa'id" without diacritics. I'll stay consistent with "Ramaḍān" but may adjust to avoid overusing diacritics elsewhere.

Handling transliteration and names
I’ll write “Ramadan” instead of “Ramaḍān” and use “Qur’an” with an apostrophe, but avoid diacritics outside of narrator names. While some technical terms might lose accuracy, I’ll follow the instruction to avoid ALA-LC except for narrator names like “Abū Hurayrah” or “ʿAbd Allāh”. For other terms, I'll use common transliterations without diacritics.

Proceeding with accurate translation choices
I’ll use Latin macrons like "ū" for transliterations. For phrases like "the hadith of Ibn ʿUmar" or "حديث أبي هريرة," I’ll avoid Arabic letters and ensure all numeric prefixes remain as references like "(183)." When translating "الحمد لله أولاً وآخراً وظاهراً وباطناً," I’ll write the literal meaning: "All praise is for Allah, at the beginning and at the end, outwardly and inwardly."

User wants me to translate Arabic text into English, following a few detailed guidelines. The translation should honor names with ALA-LC transliteration, especially when it comes to narrators. There are specific phrases, like “أتدرون من المفلس؟,” I’ll translate, and also regular Arabic characters like "ﷺ" for صلى الله عليه وسلم should stay intact. Other references like poetry and Quranic verses will also translate with care, and I'll keep consistent ID references like P238. Lastly, I'll cite the file with (website).

Ensuring proper translation and formatting
User wants plain text with no formatting, which is clear. I'll ensure I don't use any markdown. Regarding citations, they're necessary but I'll place them at the very end, on their own line, while keeping the text clean. As for "الله" I'll use "Allah" unless it refers to "ilāh," in which case I'll use "ilāh" as a common noun, transliterated with the macron.

Clarifying translation rules for references
The instruction specifies using ALA-LC transliteration for narrators in chains, but not for other textual content. So, names like "ilāh" should be transliterated for generic deities. For Quranic citations, I'll translate the verse into English while retaining parentheses for verse numbers, and transliterate Surah names like "al-Taghābun."

Clarifying transliteration for non-narrator names
The user wants ALA-LC transliteration for narrators in chains, but didn't specify for other names. Based on this, I'll stick to ALA-LC for narrators and use common English transliterations (like "Saddam Hussein") for proper nouns and non-narrator names. This should help maintain clarity while following the guidelines.

Clarifying transliteration rules for non-narrators
The instructions specify ALA-LC transliteration for narrator names in chains, but they didn’t clearly address non-narrators. For names like "Juhaymān" or "Shaykh al-Islām Ibn Taymiyyah," I'll use standard transliteration without diacritics to avoid confusion. For narrations, I’ll apply ALA-LC where applicable for clarity. I'll also follow the request to translate verses and poetry properly while using plain straight quotes. Arabic characters beyond ﷺ will be excluded.

Translating Arabic terms accurately with consistency
I’ll stick to using Latin transliteration for surah names like "al-Taghābun" without diacritics to avoid confusion. For technical terms like "aqeedah," I’ll use the transliterations 'aqidah and manhaj as instructed, keeping them consistent. Translation of phrases like "Tawbah Nasuh" will remain literal, and I'll ensure proper disclaimers and contextual translations, like "sincere repentance" or "Allah is sufficient for us." It's important to maintain clarity and consistency across all text elements.

Consistent translation and formatting guidelines
I'll ensure to keep segment IDs like "P238 -" in the translation exactly as in the Arabic text. Honorifics like "رحمه الله تعالى" will be translated as "may Allah have mercy on him", and I'll use "Messenger of Allah ﷺ" for "رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم". For names like "Muhammad", I'll use the simpler "Muhammad" without extra diacritics, observing the rules for transliteration only on narrators.

Translating quotes and book titles
The translation of the quote will be: "For every person, his statement may be accepted or rejected, except the Messenger of Allah ﷺ." The transliteration for "al-Khallāl" is correct. I'll also keep transliterated titles like "al-Istighāthah: Refuting al-Bakri" while ensuring accuracy in volume details, and using English for page numbers.

Translating terms and maintaining accuracy
For segment P238k, I'll translate terms like "الحرم المكي" as "the Sacred Mosque in Makkah" and keep phrases like "faction" and "misguided." I'll ensure concepts like "iman" are preserved as "faith," and clarify "their blood and honor" with "life and chastity" for accuracy. The citation will be at the end, and Arabic names will be transliterated correctly.

Translating Quranic phrases and preserving clarification
I’ll translate the Quranic verses and maintain the references with the corresponding surah names in English transliteration, like al-Taghabun, al-Nisa, etc., and include verse numbers just as in the original text. I'll also keep translation of idiomatic phrases like "warts and all" for accuracy and direct meaning.

The user wants me to translate Arabic text with segment IDs preserved. I'll ensure only the names of narrators follow ALA-LC transliteration, such as Abū Mūsā and ʿAbd Allāh ibn ʿAmr, including diacritics for accuracy. I must also refrain from translating the Prophet’s name in the chain.

Clarifying transliteration for hadith chain
It looks like "to the Prophet ﷺ" is part of the chain, but the instruction specifies that we only transliterate narrator names. So, I'll stick with naming narrators like Abū Mūsā and ʿAbd Allāh ibn ʿAmr in ALA-LC format. For other names, like well-known scholars, I’ll use common Latin transliteration without diacritics.

Transliteration for names and instructions
I need to transliterate all Arabic words into English, as there cannot be Arabic characters. For narrators’ names, I’ll use ALA-LC with diacritics. For other proper names like Muhammad ibn Salih al-Uthaymin, I'll use simpler transliteration without diacritics to follow the instructions, though diacritics might seem more accurate.

Handling translation of Arabic content
I'll avoid diacritics except for the names of narrators and follow instructions to keep other names without diacritics. No Arabic letters except ﷺ, and I’ll translate "أولا:" and similar phrases like "First:" or "Important notices:" as required. Quran verses will be translated, but we'll retain references like [al-Tawbah]. I'll keep transliterations for well-known book names like "Sahih al-Bukhari."

Final translation considerations and formatting
I’ll transliterate surah names without diacritics like al-Tawbah, al-Saff, etc., and use common forms. I'll translate "الله" as "Allah" and "الله تعالى" as "Allah, Exalted is He" for reverence. For "رضي الله عنه," I’ll translate as “may Allah be pleased with him.” I'll avoid Arabic punctuation, preserve segment IDs, and ensure proper translations for technical terms like "fitnah." I'll add citations as required at the end, maintaining plain-text format.

Translating Islamic terms and context
For terms like "fitnah," I'll likely preserve the transliteration but add an explanation in parentheses, such as "fitnah (persecution/temptation)." Similarly, I'll keep terms like "jihad," "Shari'ah," and "wali al-amr" as transliterated with minimal explanation where necessary. Certain terms might be translated, like "خليفة" as "caliph" or "شرع" as "law/legislation of Allah."

Translating the blessings on the Prophet
When mentioning the Prophet Muhammad, I’ll translate "ṣallā Allāh wa-sallam..." as "and may Allah send prayers, peace, and blessings upon our Prophet Muhammad ﷺ," even though it's not the same phrase as "صلى الله عليه وسلم." The use of ﷺ should still apply as mentioned in the instructions. Additionally, I’ll ensure no Arabic verse titles appear, using transliteration instead.

Translating references and Quran verses
For bracketed references like book names, I should transliterate proper nouns and avoid Arabic. For example, "Sahih al-Bukhari—Book of Tawhid" would stay transliterated. For "لقاء الباب المفتوح رقم 150," I’ll go with “Open Meeting no. 150.” For Quran references like at-Tawbah 9:111, I’ll translate the verse while keeping the numbers and surah references as specified.

Translating Quranic verses and hadiths
For verses like al-Saff 61:10-11, al-Hajj 22:40-41, and others, I’ll provide translations, ensuring they convey the meaning accurately. For example, "Monstrous is the word..." for al-Kahf 18:5, and "Allah does not burden any soul except with its capacity" for Quran 2:286. I'll handle the translation of hadiths similarly.

Translating hadith and preserving specific terms
The hadith about fighting for the right cause will be translated to reflect its essence: "A man fights out of tribal zeal, bravery, or to be seen—who fights for the path of Allah?" The response is clear—only fighting for the sake of elevating Allah’s word counts. I'll translate specific terms like "manhaj" accurately and look after preserving them in technical contexts.

Translating fatawa with Islamic terms carefully
I’m going to deliver a plain-text translation, ensuring no Arabic characters except for ﷺ. I'll mention key terms like "jihad," "Shari'ah," and "wali al-amr" while preserving references. I'll avoid Arabic numerals and punctuation. The translation will follow the fatawa structure, keeping hadith and Quran verses intact within brackets when mentioned.

Translating fatwas with attention to detail
I’m translating while ensuring accuracy in terms like "jihad," "Shari'ah," and "imam." I’ll avoid Arabic numerals but use Latin diacritics like ḥ for clarity. I'll carefully preserve page markers (P239a, etc.) and maintain transliteration for narrators like Abū Mūsā. The translation will focus on clarity and avoiding the Arabic script entirely while still delivering key concepts.

I'm now zeroing in on the request, parsing out the key requirements for this translation task. My focus is on understanding the nuances and challenges of the source material. I've pinpointed the relevant aspects: the role of the translator, the source format, and the specific author. My aim is to define a strategy that maximizes accuracy and clarity.

Detailing the Constraints

I'm solidifying the constraints now. English is the target, with high accuracy favored, unless context indicates otherwise. The Aqeedah, Manhaj, Hadith disciplines, and Jarh wa Ta'dil are paramount. Preserving full Isnad chains is crucial. I'll employ ALA-LC for narrator names only, translating the Matn. I'm hard-coding key translations like "Allah" and ﷺ, and ensuring no other Arabic characters are present. IDs and a plain text format are essential, with no markdown or all-caps. I'll use a three-pass revision process to confirm structure, context, and transliteration are accurate.

Unpacking the Hypocrisy

I'm presently examining the author's argument on selective criticism. I'm noting the apparent double standard in expectations of public figures. The author's point is that Brotherhood figures are not being held to account for their stances as harshly as some others. I'm focusing on concrete examples: al-Suwaydān and Bahraini Shias, al-Qaraḍāwī and UAE rulers, al-Ghannūshī's predictions, al-Būṭī and the Syrian regime. I'm also considering the author's question about their students' revolutionary statements. Finally, I'm analyzing the quote from Ḥāmid al-‘Alī and its inflammatory rhetoric.

Analyzing Partisanship's Warnings

I'm now diving into the latest segments. I'm noting the closing teaser for upcoming articles and the standard doxology. I'm focusing on the warning against "preachers of destruction" and their ties to the Safavids and Muslim Brotherhood, using specific examples of seemingly contradictory statements. The author's critique of "martyrdom operations" terminology is also a key point, especially the challenge directed at specific individuals to address al-Qaraḍāwī's praise of the Iranian Revolution.

Evaluating Qaraḍāwī's Stance

I'm now deeply engaged with al-Qaraḍāwī's praise for Khomeini, focusing on its implications. I've noted the call for academic scrutiny of the Islamic aspects Khomeini established and the contradictions it exposes. I'm considering the timing of al-Qaraḍāwī's statements, made long after the revolution, and the regional repercussions. I am particularly surprised by his positive view and am now analyzing the context in the wake of Ṣāliḥ al-Luḥaydān's prayer against the Muslim Brotherhood. I've corrected a prior error, recognizing my misinterpretation of a quote by Ḥāmid al-‘Alī.

Clarifying the Critique

I'm now fully immersed in the "Letter Not Carried by Mail" context. I'm noting the specific details concerning Shaykh ‘Abd al-Raḥmān ‘Abd al-Khāliq and his student Ḥāmid al-‘Alī. The focus is on al-‘Alī's inflammatory article, "Eyes Watch the Emirates...", and the call for protests in Saudi Arabia. I'm exploring the seven pointed questions posed to Shaykh ‘Abd al-Raḥmān, especially regarding foreign involvement and comparisons to other regional unrest. I'm also considering the implications of the contrasting views held by his students, especially in light of a recent meeting with the Grand Mufti.

Adjusting Translation Choices

I'm presently refining the translation of key terms within this piece. I'm focusing on "the activist" as a more accurate translation of "pejorative" in this context. Rebellion, revolting, and uprising are now my options for Khārijah/Khurūj. I'm choosing "disbeliever" for Tāghūt/Kāfir. I'm aware that Jarḥ wa Ta‘dīl is not in the classical sense but I am aware how it is used here. I'm also double-checking transliterations of all names to ensure consistency and precision for these key figures. Finally, I've started drafting the segment "Brother reader, do not be surprised..." focusing on Safavid agreement.

Finalizing the Analysis

I'm now pulling together the final pieces of this complex critique. I'm focusing on the Manhaj differences and historical context within these groups, particularly tracing the connections from Al-Bannā to Al-Suwaydān. I'm carefully translating the impassioned quotes of Ḥāmid al-‘Alī, including the powerful metaphors. Finally, I'm constructing the final paragraphs with the necessary religious formulas.

Analyzing Final Arguments

I'm now diving into the finer points of the author's closing arguments. I'm carefully translating the metaphors and passionate language used by Hamid al-Alī, focusing on the nuances. I'm also reviewing the religious formulas and ensuring they are correctly translated to accurately reflect the author's intent. Finally, I'm working to integrate the critique of the term "martyrdom operations" with other arguments to make a cohesive final analysis.

Revising Terminology

I'm now zeroing in on fine-tuning specific word choices, focusing on clarity and accuracy. I'm prioritizing the context of terms like "Safavids," "Nusayri," and "Hadasī," ensuring the translation aligns with the author's intended meaning. After evaluating, I will render those terms as "the Iranian regime/proxies", "the disbelieving Ba'athist Alawite regime", and "Hadas member", respectively, for increased clarity, whilst keeping the original "Hadasī" if needed to be literal. The overall goal is to convey the intended message effectively while preserving the source's meaning, so as to avoid misinterpretation.

Adjusting Specific Translations

My focus is shifting to clarifying the author's meaning with greater precision. I'm choosing "Hadas member Dr. Jam‘ān al-Ḥarbash" to identify him clearly. I've noted "Jūdiyy" refers to Mount Judi. I'm confirming terms like "Shāhīn" and "‘Arānīn" align with the intended metaphors: "Shāhīn" for peregrine falcons, and "'Arānīn" to describe pride or leaders. I'm also ensuring correct cultural references, for example, "Bouazizi of Saudi", and I've now correctly transliterated all names in preparation for the final revision.

I need to translate Arabic into English with accuracy while only using ALA-LC transliteration for names of narrators in the chain, like Ibn ʿAbbās. Since Jibrīl is an angel and not a narrator, I won't transliterate him here. For names in the matn or those outside the chain, I don’t need to transliterate.

Clarifying transliteration for non-narrator names
The instructions specify that only the names of narrators in the chain should be transliterated using ALA-LC with diacritics. For other Arabic names, I think it's safer to use standard English transliteration without diacritics to avoid confusion and ensure clarity. This helps maintain consistency with the rules provided.

Transliteration and translation guidelines for Islamic content
User may expect transliteration for scholars, so I’ll stick to plain English transliteration without diacritics for non-narrator names. For Qur'anic verses, I’ll translate them and include verse numbers, but no Arabic characters. I'll use "Allah" for God, except when the text refers to "ilāh" (e.g., "a god besides Allah").

Translation details for Islamic content
I need to keep segment IDs like P246a intact and ensure alignment markers are correct. For "صلى الله عليه وسلم," I’ll use ﷺ. For terms like "عليه السلام," I’ll translate as "peace be upon him" to avoid transliteration. I’ll also translate terms like aqeedah and manhaj accordingly, while avoiding unnecessary Arabic characters.

Transliteration for technical terms and hadith references
For terms like "Salafiyyah," I'll transliterate it as "Salafiyyah" with double y to reflect the technical term. For "الحركة الدستورية الاسلامية," I'll use "Islamic Constitutional Movement (Hadas)." In terms of books, such as "السنن الكبرى للبيهقي," I’ll go with "al-Sunan al-Kubra of al-Bayhaqi" without diacritics since it's not a narrator name. For hadith, I'll translate and keep the chain with correct transliterations like Ibn ʿAbbās.

Transliteration choices and citation handling
For names like "ʿUkashah," since it's not in the chain, I’ll opt for "Ukashah ibn Mihsan" without diacritics to stay consistent. For translations, I’ll use "do not seek ruqyah" and translate actions like "do not cauterize" without adding Arabic characters except ﷺ as per the instructions. Regarding the file citation, I'll add it in plain text at the end to comply.

Handling citations and translation of terms
I’ll reference the file content and provide a citation at the end of the translation—like "(website)"—since that’s what the system requires. I’ll avoid Arabic letters except ﷺ. In terms of terms like "iman" and "kufr," I’ll keep them as they’re technical terms. For "Ikhwani Salafiyyah," I’ll use the translation "Salafi-Ikhwani" as needed.

Translating terms and verses correctly
When translating terms, I’ll use "takfiri" for التكفيري, keeping the context intact. For quotes, like "the lover of freedom", I'll preserve the quotes as they are. For phrases like "compound ignorance" and "calamities," I’ll go with standard translations. Explanations in the Qur'anic verses will include Surah names without Arabic, ensuring proper formatting and citations. For Salat phrases, I'll follow the instruction, keeping things in English and using ﷺ when needed.

Ensuring proper translation and consistency
For phrases like "النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم," I'll use "Prophet ﷺ," and for "رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم," I'll say "Messenger of Allah ﷺ." Likewise, "رضي الله عنهما" will be "may Allah be pleased with him," and I’ll follow ALA-LC rules for transliteration. I'll ensure everything is clear without markup.

Translating key terms and phrases accurately
For idioms like "لا تسمن ولا تغني من جوع," I’ll translate it literally as “that neither fattens nor satisfies hunger.” I'll also ensure accurate translations of verses and hadith, such as: "The verses on that are very many…" and continue with the required linguistic thoroughness. Handling all segments with attention to meaning, especially when dealing with proper names or sensitive topics like freedom of expression.

Carefully translating sensitive religious content
I need to translate multiple sections of the text, keeping the meaning intact while respecting the specific language nuances. I'll handle quotes, verses, and hadith with accuracy — such as "pardon" for "العفو", and phrases like "the hypocrites' bad words mentioned in the Qur'an" with caution. I’ll also include Latin transliterations for key terms and ensure consistency across the translation. By adding correct reference numbers and providing a structured translation, I’ll maintain clarity for the reader.

Translating Quranic verses and hadith
I need to carefully translate key verses from the Qur’an, ensuring each concept is represented accurately. I'll handle specific terms like "zina" (adultery) and "Athan" (sin) carefully. I'll also maintain consistency when translating hadith, such as the account of the Prophet ﷺ and various prophets. Each verse and hadith requires precision.

It seems that I need to translate Arabic segments, making sure to preserve IDs and output plain text. I only need to apply ALA-LC transliteration to names of narrators in the chain, not other text. If there’s no chain of narration, I shouldn’t worry about transliterating any other names.

Clarifying transliteration for names
The instruction says to use ALA-LC transliteration only for names of narrators in the chain and not for the textual content. This suggests that names like Prophet Muḥammad ﷺ should likely remain in their common English forms. For narrators within a chain, I should use diacritics, but not for non-narrator names.

Determining when to apply ALA-LC transliteration
It seems the instruction clarifies that ALA-LC transliteration is only required for names of narrators in chains. For non-chain Arabic names, it’s best to use standard transliterations like "Tariq al-Suwaidan" without diacritics unless it’s contextually necessary. Diacritics are allowed as part of Latin extended characters, like "Ṭāriq".

Handling Quranic verses and transliteration
For names, I’ll stick to common English forms with no diacritics, like "Tariq al-Suwaidan" and "Muhammad Abd al-Ghaffar." For Quranic verses, I’ll translate entirely into English, respecting the no-Arabic rule but include surah and verse numbers in English. Surah names may use diacritics but remain common, like "[al-Nisa']." I’ll maintain curly braces but replace Arabic content with English.

Translating Arabic text and context
I need to translate each segment carefully, ensuring I keep the marker IDs like "P248 -". For Arabic terms like "حدس" or "الربع", I'll translate them without including Arabic letters, using common terms like "Hadas" or "the crew." Specific phrases like "لا اله الا الله" will also be translated, and I've got to maintain the quotes like "the deceased Ba'athist" carefully. I'll also include references like "Dr. Tariq al-Suwaidan—may Allah guide him."

Addressing translation request and citation inclusion
The user asked for plain text, but the system instructions require citations. I'll add the citation at the end, without violating the plain-text rule. The citation will be inline as required: "P249i - ... (website)". For the translation, I'll start with the introduction about Sunnah, explaining the permissibility of denouncing wrongdoers by name.

Clarifying the discourse regarding Dr. Tariq al-Suwaidan
Dr. Tariq al-Suwaidan’s statement that objections to Allah, His Messenger, and Islam's rulings were permissible in the name of “freedom of expression” sparked reactions. Dr. Ajil al-Nashmi strongly disagreed, calling for Dr. Suwaidan to retract his statement and publicly seek forgiveness. He questioned the mild response citing the Prophet's anger toward violations of Allah's sanctities.

Addressing the actions and beliefs of Tariq al-Suwaidan
The author emphasizes clarifying the truth and not fearing blame for following Allah’s teachings. They challenge the loyalty to one’s group over zeal for Allah's rulings, inviting sincere repentance. Additionally, they question someone's praise of Tariq al-Suwaidan, highlighting his public promotion of controversial beliefs, and points to a troubling statement about the fate of non-believers, referencing statements made by others like Salah al-Rashid.

Critiquing ideological stances and calls for denouncement
The author continues by discussing verses from Qur’an mentioning the eternity of the Fire’s inhabitants and questioning views on Iblis’s fate. They criticize followings of certain ideologies, calling on scholars to denounce falsehoods and reconsider their beliefs. The author also condemns the Ikhwan group for its deceptive tactics and historical shifts in allegiance.

Clarifying manhaj and organization affiliations
The author discusses how some individuals, like Shaykh Abd al-Rahman Abd al-Khaliq, though not officially part of the Ikhwan organization, still follow its methodology (manhaj). They note that real affiliation is defined by thought and methods, not just formal membership or title. Finally, they ask for protection from tribulations, invoking blessings on Prophet Muhammad.

Clarifying Salafi and Ikhwani affiliations
The text discusses the historical development of Salafi groups in Kuwait, noting their initial scholarly activities and eventual political involvement. It explains how certain groups, originally Salafi, became closely aligned with or even indistinguishable from the Ikhwan, adopting similar methodologies. The writer emphasizes the importance of maintaining a clear religious stance without succumbing to political manipulation.


I need to translate Arabic segments accurately but preserve the IDs at the start. For names like Abu Hurayrah and Umm Salamah, I'll use ALA-LC transliteration. Al-Bukhārī is a book, not a narrator, so it shouldn't be transliterated. I’m thinking that when personal names aren’t narrators, they should probably be translated directly into English.

Clarifying transliteration guidelines
The instructions are clear: I should only apply ALA-LC transliteration to the names of narrators in the chain, like Abū Hurayrah. For others, like Umar al-Ashqar or Tariq al-Suwaidan, I can use common transliteration. However, I’ll maintain the standard "Prophet ﷺ" without transliterating titles.

Transliteration and formatting guidelines
I'll use ALA-LC for narrators in the chain like Abū Hurayrah and Umm Salamah, but for others like Tariq al-Suwaidan, I'll stick to common transliterations without diacritics. Qur'anic verses will be translated with the Arabic in braces, but no Arabic in the final response. I've also noted not to use diacritics for book names like Sahih al-Bukhari.

Finalizing translation format and terms
Each segment will start with the ID, like "P253d - ", followed by the translation in plain text. For Qur'anic names, I’ll use standard English with transliteration but without diacritics, like "al-Isra’." For technical terms like "ḥadd al-riddah," I’ll translate it as "the ḥadd punishment for apostasy" with diacritics, but the instructions don’t specify unique rules for technical terms like this.

Transliteration, quotes, and formatting choices
We'll use simplified transliteration for technical terms like "ʿaqidah" but leave out diacritics for non-narrators, sticking to ALA-LC for narrators. For terms like "Salafiyyah," we’ll go with "Salafiyyah" without diacritics. I’ll also translate poetry and hadith like "…and whoever believes in Allah..." while keeping citations, ellipses, and Qur'anic numbering intact.

Finalizing transliteration, citation, and translation approach
I’ll follow the user’s instruction for plain text, including only necessary citations in text. The citations will be added at the end. I won't include Arabic text, but translations will use curly braces and numbers for Qur'anic verses like "{And the covenant of Allah...} (15) [al-Ahzab]." I'll transliterate names like Umm Salamah without diacritics, and include Bukhari hadith chain correctly.

Translating segment details and preserving meaning
I’ll start by translating phrases and terms accurately, like "Revival of Islamic Heritage Society" for "جمعية احياء التراث" and "desires" for "الاهواء." I’ll translate the specific quotes carefully, respecting punctuation and providing literal interpretations, including references for hadith. I'll maintain structure, ensuring each segment begins with its ID, and handle terms like "bid’ah" appropriately. I'll translate each of the segments—P253d, P253e, and P253f—while ensuring accuracy and maintaining the original meaning.

Translating remaining segments and terms
I'll tackle segment P253g, providing translations for phrases like "كاد المريب يقول خذوني" and praise for Tahriq al-Suwaidan. I'll make sure the translation uses "Allah" instead of "God" and maintain accuracy, especially for Qur'anic verses and hadith. I’ll take care in ensuring Arabic numerals are converted and include citations at the end as required. The goal is to keep the meaning intact with literal translation while respecting the specifics given.

The task specifies using ALA-LC transliteration only for narrator names in the chain, which suggests I should avoid transliterating modern scholars' names in this way. However, I’m a bit unsure whether I should also apply the same convention to transliterate other names without diacritics. The tricky part is balancing consistent transliteration with diacritics.

Clarifying transliteration rules and translations
I'll apply ALA-LC only for full chains, and for non-chain names, standard transliteration without diacritics works best. For names like "Ibn Taymiyyah" or "Abdulrahman bin Mahdi," they can follow this convention. When translating "Allah," I'll stick to "Allah" except for "ilah," where I'll use "deity” for clarity, like in "There is no ilah except Allah."

Choosing translations and technical terms
For "لا إله إلا الله", I'll go with "There is no deity except Allah" as "deity" captures the meaning better than "ilah." For technical terms like "aqeedah," "ʿaqidah" with the 'ayn seems correct, as they're meant to preserve the terminology. I'll use "ʿaqidah" and "al-jarḥ wa al-taʿdil" to stay consistent with the required transliterations.

Following translation and formatting instructions
I’ll use the specified terms like "detailed jarḥ takes precedence over general taʿdil" and translate the hadith quote as needed. I'll avoid any Arabic characters except ﷺ, and for titles like “اقتضاء الصراط,” I’ll transliterate it as "Iqtidaʾ al-Ṣirāṭ.” No Arabic numerals, just Western digits. For dates, I’ll be careful to follow the safest format like "21/7 (Gregorian) 1965."

Translating terms and formatting names
For the user’s preference for literal translations, I'll use phrases like “the 21st of the 7th month, Gregorian, year 1965.” I'll translate “جمعية احياء التراث الاسلامي” to "Revival of Islamic Heritage Society" but provide a literal transliteration as "Ihya' al-Turath Society," and for "الدكتور خالد السلطان", I'll keep "Dr. Khalid al-Sultan." I'll avoid diacritics where not needed and ensure consistency with names like “Muhammad al-Humoud al-Najdi.”

Translating and ensuring consistency
I'll translate key phrases like "and Allah's blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad ﷺ" correctly, using the ﷺ symbol and keeping the honorific for Muhammad intact. For titles, I’ll transliterate "al-Usul al-Ilmiyyah li-l-Da’wah al-Salafiyyah" and "fiqh al-waqi' (jurisprudence of reality)"—using plain transliterations and ensuring no Arabic script. I’ll preserve quotes and dialogue, particularly in referenced segments.

Maintaining IDs and consistency
I’ll be careful to keep the segment IDs like "P254b - " exactly as they are to maintain order. Since there’s no isnad chain with quotes by Abd al-Rahman ibn Mahdi, we don’t need ALA-LC transliteration for this. For other names, I’ll use common transliterations where applicable. Words like "tazkiyahs" will be translated as "commendations," and phrases like "طَعَّان سَبَّاب شَتَّام" will be rendered as "one who is constantly stabbing (with words), abusive, insulting."

Translating key phrases carefully
For the translation, I'll be literal with phrases like "a defamer, foul-mouthed, reviler" and use "a slanderer, abusive, one who insults." Phrases like "لا يسلم مني أحد…" translate to "no one is safe from me... etc." I'll also use "people of the Qur'an" for "أهل القرآن" and "may Allah guide him to iman" for "هداه الله للايمان."

I'll maintain clarity and consistency in translating each segment.

Translating and structuring phrases
For "ثِقْ تماماً," I'll use "Be fully certain." "أجزم وأكاد أقسم" becomes "I assert—and I almost swear." "أثبت في الجماعة" translates to "more firmly rooted in the group," implying a stronger position. For "تحولها الصريح الى طريق الاخوان المسلمين," I'll say "its clear shift to the path of the Muslim Brotherhood," keeping things as literal as possible.

I’ll lay them out as separate lines for clarity.

Translating and structuring phrases clearly
For "قبل صلاة الظهر," I'll use "before Dhuhr prayer." "الحرم" will be translated as "al-Haram" or "the Haram" for consistency.

"رابطة العالم الاسلامي" is "Muslim World League," with no need for Arabic characters in quotes. "رئيس مركز «أبو الكلام»" will be "head of the ‘Abu al-Kalam’ Center" in English.

I'll mention Imam Muhammad ibn Saud University and other details. Closing: "ما ظهر منها وما بطن" translates to "what is apparent of them and what is hidden." The prayer is "praise be to Allah..." with ﷺ.

Translating and structuring phrases clearly
For "الحمد لله وحده," I'll use "Praise be to Allah alone." "أما بعد" translates to "To proceed." "غفر الله له ولوالديه" means "May Allah forgive him and his parents."

Noting phrases like "I sought...in support of truth," and "perhaps good in the matter" for clarity. Special terms will remain intact like "fiqh al-waqiʿ" as "the look."

I’ll mention quotes and specific references, maintaining authenticity in detailed expressions.

The user wants a translation of Arabic text. I'll make sure to preserve the IDs and apply proper ALA-LC transliteration to the names of narrators only in the hadith chain, not the content. For example, names like ʿUrwah ibn al-Zubayr, Zaynab bint Abī Salamah, etc., should be transliterated. The Prophet ﷺ is part of the matn, not the chain, so no transliteration needed there.

Translating names with specific formatting rules
The user wants me to follow the instruction to only apply ALA-LC transliteration to the narrators' names in the chain: ʿUrwah ibn al-Zubayr, Zaynab bint Abī Salamah, Umm Ḥabībah bint Abī Sufyān, and Zaynab bint Jaḥsh. For references to scholars, it seems I should use standard Anglicization (e.g., Shaykh Rabīʿ...) instead of transliteration, since it's outside the chain.

Choosing convention for transliteration and translation
For names outside the chain, it seems safer to use conventional English spellings without diacritics (e.g., "Shaykh Rabi' ibn Hadi al-Madkhali") to avoid violating instructions. For the term "ilah" in "لا اله الا الله", it should be translated as “There is no deity except Allah,” since "ilah" refers to a generic deity here.

Translating with specific rules for names and phrases
I need to avoid using "God" and instead use "Allah" or "a god/deity" unless referring to "ilah". For the shahadah, "There is no deity except Allah" seems best. I'll also translate Quran verses and hadiths in English without Arabic, maintain numeric markers like P279a, and accurately follow ALA-LC for transliterations of names, with the correct diacritics.

Converting Arabic references and transliterating correctly
For citations, I'll convert Arabic surah names to English without diacritics, like "Qaf" or "al-Ma'idah", and use Qur'an numbering (e.g., 50:18). For hadith references, I'll simply use the transliterations "al-Bukhari" and "Muslim" without Arabic symbols. For terms like "سلفيون," I'll likely go with "Salafis" or "al-Jamiyyah," depending on context.

Translating Islamic terms and ensuring consistency
For terms like "المدخلية," I'll use "al-Madkhaliyyah," and for "العقيدة," I'll use "aqeedah," which is common for "creed." I'll follow specific instructions to transliterate "aqeedah," "manhaj," "hadith," "jarh," and "ta'dil" correctly. For "jarh," it's narrator criticism, but here it's about criticizing scholars, so I’ll clarify. Punctuation and formatting will be plain text, no Arabic except ﷺ. Citations will be standard without using markdown.

Translating full text segments and citing accurately
I’m working with mclick output, which includes all the necessary segments with line numbers. I’ll cite using ranges like "turn4file0" and include segments from P279a to P281d. I'll translate chapter headings such as "ملاحظة مهمة" to "Important note" and "شكر وتقدير" to "Thanks and appreciation." Quran verses are also included, like "ما يلفظ من قول إلا لديه رقيب عتيد (18)", which I'll translate as, "He does not utter a word except that with him is an observer prepared."

Translating and citing Quranic verses
For the verse "قل هاتوا برهانكم إن كنتم صادقين (111)", I'll translate it as "Say, 'Bring your proof, if you are truthful.'" (al-Baqarah 2:111). For "ولا تلبسوا الحق بالباطل...", it becomes "And do not mix the truth with falsehood and conceal the truth while you know." (al-Baqarah 2:42). I'll ensure to include the corresponding references for each verse, like "al-Isra 17:16" and "al-Ra'd 13:11".

Translating hadith and special terminology
I need to translate the verse from al-Talaq (65:8-10), and provide the relevant hadith with respect to riba and other topics. I'll use ALA-LC for narrators in the chain, but avoid diacritics for matn or other names, except for "Allah". I'll ensure to translate terms like "riba" for الربا, "'inah" for العينة, and "jihad" for الجهاد. I'll use ﷺ for the Messenger of Allah where appropriate.

Translating key terms and preserving style
I’ll translate terms like "الأمر بالمعروف والنهي عن المنكر" as "commanding the good and forbidding the evil", "التبرج والسفور" as "tabarruj and uncovering", and "الكتاب والسنة" as "the Book and the Sunnah". Also, "توحيد" will be translated as "tawhid". I'll preserve rhetorical style and use specific terms like "kufr" and "Allah" without Arabic characters, keeping the flow natural.

Clarifying transliteration, citations, and formatting
I need to ensure no diacritics beyond Latin diacritics for transliterations. For narrator names, I'll use ALA-LC with diacritics, but for everything else, no diacritics. I’ll also keep segment IDs, format citations inline, and include line ranges. Citations should go at the end of each translation, avoiding special characters and Arabic numbers.

Translating with attention to consistency
I’ll make sure to translate with cohesive language while respecting punctuation and quotes. "لا إله إلا الله" will be translated consistently as "There is no deity except Allah," and "كلا والذي نفسي بيده" as "No, by the One in Whose Hand is my soul." For place names like "غزة" and "سورية", I'll keep "Gaza" and "Syria" without diacritics, and apply title case for headings. Formatting will reflect these preferences. I'll keep the terms "aqeedah" and "jarh" without direct substitution.

Finalizing precise translation choices
In translating technical terms, I'll keep "jarh" as "the principle of jarh of the senior scholars" for accuracy. For P281c, I'll clarify "jarh" as "a technical term in hadith sciences." I'll also translate "بالمعنى الدارج" as "in the common sense" and "حاشاهما" as "far be it from them." I'll continue with the adjustments to phrases like "your reckoning is with Allah" and "still in the first chapter" based on context.

Clarifying translation choices and diacritic use
For P279f, I’ll keep the translation as “when they are weak and their enemy is strong” as it’s clear. I’ll also use “fighting not obligatory upon them.” On the names, I'll maintain transliteration with diacritics for narrators like “ʿUrwah ibn al-Zubayr.” Also, for "Gog and Magog," that's fine. For other phrases like "Madinah," no diacritics needed.

Translating hadiths and verses accurately
For the hadith on riba, I’ll translate: “The Messenger of Allah ﷺ cursed the one who consumes riba, the one who gives it, its scribe, and its two witnesses.” For the second hadith, I’ll use “Heads like humps of leaning Bactrian camels.” The hadith on 'inah and the verses from al-Talaq will be translated as requested, including "Indeed we belong to Allah..." and "al-Jamiyyah is a dangerous sect, so beware of it."

Translating key Islamic terms and phrases
In P281a: translating "al-Harari al-Habashi" as part of the name for clarity, and translating "the first specializes in aqeedah" and "the second specializes in hadith." The term "jarh" will stay as "jarh of the senior scholars." Also, for takfir: "pronounced takfir on Qadhdhafi" and "kufr buwah" for clear kufr. I'll be careful with nuances during translation.

I’m tasked with translating some Arabic text, but I need to remove any Arabic characters except for ﷺ. I can’t include Arabic quotations, and the citation syntax has some special symbols, which might be allowed—though it’s not in Arabic. I’ll ensure proper transcription of names using ALA-LC, such as Abū Saʿīd al-Khudrī, Zayd ibn Thābit, and al-Jurayrī.

Translation and formatting considerations
I need to transliterate narrator names using ALA-LC (like Ḥudhayfah ibn al-Yamān, Abū Hurayrah) but modern leaders like Ben Ali and Mubārak don’t follow this rule, so I’ll keep their usual English names. For Quranic terms, I’ll translate "الله" as Allah and "صلى الله عليه وسلم" as ﷺ. I must translate verses and headings but avoid Arabic characters otherwise. I'll make sure to revise three times and maintain numerical markers as specified.

Translating hadith references and chapter headings
I need to ensure that chapter headings aren’t in all caps. For hadith references like "Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim" and "Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī," I can use standard English spellings without diacritics (e.g., Sahih al-Bukhari, Sunan Abi Dawud) since transliteration instructions only apply to names in the chain. Diacritics aren't necessary in this case.

Translation and formatting approach
I’ll translate bracketed references like [المائدة:3] into [al-Ma'idah: 3] using English spelling and diacritics, which should be fine. I’ll include a file citation at the end of the translation, as plain text without markdown. I’ll also break the translation into segments, starting with "Praise be to Allah..." followed by the hadith chain from Abū Saʿīd al-Khudrī and Zayd ibn Thābit.

Translating and formatting hadith discussions
For the hadith, I’ll begin by translating terms like “حائط لبني النجار” as "an enclosure belonging to Banū al-Najjār," and "على بغلة له" as "on his mule." I’ll transliterate names such as Abū Saʿīd, Zayd ibn Thābit, and Ḥudhayfah ibn al-Yamān, translating related phrases carefully. I'll translate the verse "فَاعْتَبِرُوا يَا أُولِي الْأَبْصَارِ" as "So take admonition, O people of insight" and follow the hadith chain with context, ensuring consistency across the entire translation.

Translating terms and preserving context
I’ll make sure to translate Quran verses accurately, like al-Anfal 46: "Obey Allah and His Messenger and do not dispute..." and provide clear translations for the corresponding hadith from Abū Hurayrah. For sect terms, I'll carefully translate “Alawites of al-Sham” and “Rāfiḍah of Iran,” with possible transliterations but aiming for clarity. I'll be mindful of complex terminology like “Party of Satan” and people like "Ben Ali" or "Hosni Mubarak" while adhering to guidelines on diacritics.

Ensuring proper translation and formatting
I need to make sure no Arabic characters like punctuation or curly quotes appear, so I’ll replace Arabic verse tags with standard parentheses. For terms like "Allah, majestic and exalted," and the phrase for sending blessings upon the Prophet Muḥammad, I’ll follow the user's preference to use “ ﷺ” only when the exact phrase “صلى الله عليه وسلم” is used, and avoid it otherwise.

Translating and formatting hadith content
I'll use ﷺ for any blessing on the Prophet Muḥammad ﷺ, even when the phrase isn't exactly "صلى الله عليه وسلم" but still refers to blessings. For "رضي الله عنهما," I'll translate it as "may Allah be pleased with them both" without using Arabic. Hadith numbers will stay as-is, and I'll translate technical terms like "al-ʿinah" to "'inah transactions" with an explanation. I'll maintain proper convention throughout.

Translating terms and formatting text
For "ʿinah," I’ll translate it as "al-'inah (a buyback sale)" to clarify its meaning. I'll avoid diacritics as the original instruction preferred that approach. For terms like "أذناب البقر" ("tails of cattle"), I’ll keep it literal, and "رضيتم بالزرع" I’ll translate as "became content with farming" without altering the essence. The headings will be translated as "Benefit One" and so on, and citations will be formatted in plain text at the end.

Translating idioms and terms carefully
For "وذهبت ريحهم," I’ll go with "their strength departed" to keep the meaning. "يضربون الأخماس بالأسداس," which means talking nonsense, will be translated by meaning, not literally. I’ll also preserve disclaimers like "والله أعلم” as "and Allah knows best." I'll keep references to grave-related details for accuracy, and translate "ماتوا في الاشراك" as "died in polytheism." I'll ensure that the political expression "علوية الشام و رافضة إيران بعضهم أولياء بعض" reflects its meaning properly.

I've been meticulously analyzing the user's request, focusing on identifying the critical elements. My expertise in Islamic content translation and the specific source (Fatawa/articles from Salim al-Tawil's website) is taking shape as I delve deeper into the core requirements. I'm starting to anticipate the nuances that will be most critical in ensuring an accurate and appropriate translation.

Developing the Translation Strategy

I'm now fully immersed in developing the translation approach. Accuracy is paramount; I lean towards a literal translation unless context requires semantic interpretation. I'm focusing on preserving isnads, using ALA-LC for narrator names, and translating all content, including chapter headings, poetry, and verses, while adhering to precise conventions like using "Allah" and ﷺ, and excluding Arabic characters other than ﷺ. Plain text output is the goal, with necessary revisions for ID verification, contextual accuracy, and transliteration. I've also noted a very important point about not fully capitalizing chapter headings.

Formulating a Response

I'm presently translating P266a, which addresses the Syrian crisis and incorporates key terms such as fitnah. The draft is taking shape, focusing on prayer for those impacted and seeking guidance. I'm prioritizing accurate and respectful translation of the Arabic terms and phrasing while maintaining the intended tone of the original text. I'm focusing on conveying the author's prayerful tone while preserving the essence of the message. I also will need to address the prayer and supplication within the text to remain consistent with Islamic conventions.

Analyzing the Narrative

I am now carefully working on the translation of the obituary for Maryam. I am making sure to capture the nuances of the introduction, including the formal opening phrase. Preserving the exact narrator names (Maryam bint Aḥmad ibn Ṣāliḥ al-Nahhām) is critical, using ALA-LC for accuracy. I'm focusing on translating key phrases accurately and respectfully. My focus is conveying the emotional tone while remaining faithful to the original.

Recalling Her Life

I'm translating the section about Maryam and her daughter. I'm capturing details like her illiteracy and remarkable memory. I'm carefully translating the verses from Surah Al-Imran. I'm focusing on the author's prayer and sentiments. I'm starting the translation of P268, including the hadith from Sahih Muslim about repentance.

Reflecting on Divine Decree

I'm now grappling with the concept of human fallibility in light of divine decree, as expressed in the hadith. I'm translating the verses from Al-Imran about the Muttaqin, keeping in mind the discussion about religious stances. Also I'm preparing to address the open letter to Faris al-T.

Examining Partisan Ideas

I'm now diving into the discussion regarding liberalism, hizbiyyah, and the different types of parties. I'm focusing on the advice to remain independent and the challenge of identifying the individual "M. A." I'm carefully analyzing the nuances, including the distinctions between partisanship and broader blocs. My task involves understanding the rulings on non-religious parties and the role of innovation within religious ones.

Assessing the Article's Core

I'm now fully immersed in translating the article that criticizes the "Western Spring," delving into its strong condemnation of the uprisings. I'm carefully translating verses from Furqan, Nisa, Baqarah, An'am, and Fatir. My work encompasses conveying the author's critique of the revolutions and the associated fitnah, including the specific wording. I'm focusing on the detailed description of destruction and the criticism of those who supported them. The article is challenging as it names specific groups. I'm focusing on aligning the correct IDs.

Reviewing Structure

I've confirmed the matching structure of the P268 series with the source, ensuring accuracy. I've also verified several key translations including "fawa'id istahdartuha," "ammiyyah," and "rabi' al-gharbi." I'm also ensuring correct rendering of specific Arabic terms to their correct technical term, paying close attention to nuanced terms.

Analyzing Critical Details

I'm now focusing on a final review, ensuring all constraints are met. I've corrected minor transliteration issues. Specifically, I've checked for plain text formatting, appropriate use of "Allah" and ﷺ, and correct rendering of Arabic terms. I'm also confirming proper handling of identifiers and non-capitalized chapter headings. I've corrected some plural terms as needed. Finally, I confirmed the correct rendering of the author's intended initials.

I'm currently focused on the specific background and expertise of Salim al-T. Understanding his specialization in Islamic content is key. This helps narrow down possible translations by providing valuable clues in terms of the style, tone, and level of formality. I'm taking notes on potential areas of focus.

Pinpointing Key Translation Elements

I've been drilling down on the specific translation elements to use. Accuracy is paramount; I will use literal translations unless meaning requires otherwise. I'm prioritizing precise Islamic terminology, like aqeedah and manhaj, and also plan to retain full isnads and use ALA-LC transliteration. I've also clarified the translation for "God" and the use of the ﷺ abbreviation.

Detailing Translation Guidelines

I've got the process in motion, clarifying important formatting rules. I'm focusing on consistency: no uppercase for chapter headings and no corrections to numeric prefixes. I'll maintain Arabic script only for ﷺ and will triple-check each segment. I've begun working through page 293, segmenting and refining translations of the Arabic text into literal and more natural English.

Assessing Theological Nuances

I'm now grappling with the theological context, particularly concerning deviations from Tawhid. I'm focusing on shrines, amulets, and innovations, noting that some may misunderstand Tawhid. I'm also considering the implications of cursing Allah and mocking His laws. I'm prioritizing accuracy in conveying these delicate concepts. I'm also working on p293, and refining translations from Arabic.

Reflecting on Syrian Conflict

I'm now contemplating the ramifications of unregulated arms funding in Syria. It's a complex issue, and I'm wrestling with the potential consequences. My immediate concern lies in the indiscriminate use of weapons, with civilians as the primary victims. I'm focusing on the tactical misuse of resources and the tragic outcome of such actions. I'm particularly interested in this new passage on page 293, regarding who bears arms.

Evaluating Potential Blowback

I'm now analyzing the implications of weapons training, particularly the risk of these weapons being turned against Muslims. I'm focusing on the potential for fighters to turn against their initial supporters. I've drafted a segment exploring this blowback, referencing Sheikh Ibn 'Uthaymin's concerns. I'm also working on translating another passage on page 293.

Addressing Regional Instability

I'm now contemplating the impact of regional instability and the potential for infighting among extremist groups, drawing parallels to Afghanistan. I'm focusing on potential disputes over funding and control, particularly in light of the fall of the Ba'athist regime. I'm considering the potential for this current advice and insight to be relevant in the days ahead. I'm translating the passage on fundraising fraud on page 293, and noting the accusations against the author.

Discerning Fundraising Misuse

I'm now zeroing in on the author's strong condemnation of deceptive fundraising. I find the examples of funds intended for Syria being diverted to Iraq, Yemen, Somalia, and even Saudi Arabia quite telling. I'm focusing on the ethical implications of this, particularly in the context of Jihad, and considering how such actions could be used to justify terrorist acts. I'm working through the specifics on page 293.

Condemning Deceptive Tactics

I'm now grappling with the author's personal experience of defamation and slander after exposing fundraising fraud and political manipulation, including accusations of being a heretic and pro-regime. I'm focusing on the ethical implications of these ad hominem attacks and their impact on the dissemination of vital information. I'm translating details from page 293.

Debunking Fabricated Claims

I'm now focusing on the author's refutation of accusations, specifically the claim about fighters in Syria being hashish addicts, and the associated slander. I find the author's outrage and use of oaths quite compelling. I'm prioritizing accuracy in conveying his impassioned defense and the incredulity he expresses. I'm working through the specifics on page 293.

Summarizing Accusations

I'm now diving into the author's response to the fabricated accusations. His outrage is palpable, especially the claim that he said all Mujahidin are hashish addicts. He recounts a specific incident where a potential suicide bomber refused, but a hashish-addicted individual was then manipulated. He firmly refutes the slander and I'm focusing on conveying his conviction and detail from page 293, regarding the incident described.

Refining Weapon Donation Stance

I'm now clarifying the author's nuanced position on weapon donations. He doesn't prohibit donations, but personally abstains, emphasizing relief aid and official channels if absolutely necessary. He acknowledges the existence of moderate Sunni organizations, but expresses caution and hesitancy regarding weapon donations. I am working to translate the Arabic text from page 293 and conveying the essence of his stance on weapon donations.

Analyzing Accusations' Implications

I'm now focusing on the author's strong denial of the accusations regarding knowledge of the unseen. He clearly refutes the claims and reiterates his aqeedah, emphasizing the serious implications. He shows concern that he is being labeled a disbeliever. I am translating the Arabic text from page 293, and conveying the author's conviction and concern, in the translation.

Asserting Knowledge Limits

I'm now clarifying the author's statement on knowledge of the unseen. He firmly denies possessing such knowledge, asserting his reliance on observation and historical patterns. He links this denial to his analysis of the Syrian conflict, predicting a political resolution based on global intervention. I'm focusing on his assertion that international powers prioritize "Israel's security" in their decision-making, which is based on historical patterns he has observed, and translating page 293.

Analyzing Political Alignments

I'm now focusing on the evolving political landscape and shifts in alliances. The author criticizes previous respect for Hezbollah, exposing contradictions in alliances, particularly with the Syrian Ba'athist regime and figures like Al-Qaradawi. I'm now translating the passage detailing this, including the strong criticism of the support for Hezbollah by the Muslim Brotherhood. This is all from page 293.

Concluding Critical Reflections

My thoughts now center on the author's final reflections and call for divine protection. I find it insightful that he questions the shift in attitudes towards the Ba'athist regime, Iran, and Hezbollah. He's also now offering prayers for Muslims facing trials and offering forgiveness to those who have wronged him. I'm focusing on translating these reflections and prayers from page 293 accurately.

Conveying Final Thoughts

I'm now focused on the conclusion, including the author's final prayers and salutations. He mentions the shift in attitudes towards the Ba'athist regime, Iran, and Hezbollah. I am translating his final words, ensuring to accurately convey his sentiments and his call for divine protection. I will complete this final section and end by translating the salutation and conclusion.

Analyzing Critical Exchanges

I am now focusing on the final exchanges from the text. I'm prioritizing accuracy in translating the dialogue where the author, Salim, addresses accusations directly and requests clarity from those who had slandered him. I'm translating the text, including the request for retraction of slanderous statements, and Salim's strong condemnation of being accused of not supporting Syrians, and any insinuations of it.

Reiterating Defense of Honesty

I am now focusing on the author's personal defense against allegations of dishonesty, and lack of patience. He denies any wrongdoing and reaffirms his commitment to accuracy, highlighting the challenges he faced during his defense. I am translating his firm rejection of the accusations and insistence on his commitment to the Salafi Manhaj, all from page 293.

Emphasizing Solidarity Defense

I'm now zeroing in on the heartfelt defense from the author's student. I'm focusing on the student's unwavering support and the personal sacrifice involved in defending the Salafi da'wah, especially Salim. This includes the student's condemnation of slander and his commitment to the truth, and the student's insistence on defending him for his guidance. I'm translating details from page 293 accurately, particularly the student's dedication and pain, and Salim's response.

Projecting Conflict's Future

I'm now focusing on the author's prediction of a bloody conflict between Syrians and Jabhat al-Nusra. He predicts foreign-backed forces will dictate terms that will involve "security for Israel." This reveals potential for future clashes and contradictions with groups seeking an Islamic caliphate, and a clear parallel to Afghan war. I'm working on the translation now.

Anticipating Further Developments

My current focus is on the author's prediction of future conflict, drawing on historical patterns from Afghanistan and Kuwait. He forecasts a bloody conflict and anticipates an imposed outcome potentially prioritizing "security for Israel." I'm now completing the translation of this prediction, which underscores the author's grounded analysis and highlights his concerns about geopolitical dynamics. The final exchange from page 293 is nearing completion.

Comparing Methodologies

I'm now comparing the methodologies of Ahl al-Sunnah wa al-Jama'ah with Ahl al-Ahwa, as detailed in the text. I'm focusing on the emphasis placed on adhering to the Book, the Sunnah, and the practices of the Salaf. The warning against the Manhaj of the People of Desires is also an important element I will focus on, as this passage opens on page 294.

Delineating Core Principles

I'm now diving into the fundamental principles, distinguishing the methodology of Ahl al-Sunnah wa al-Jama'ah from that of Ahl al-Ahwa. I'm prioritizing the importance of adhering to the Book, Sunnah, and the practices of the Salaf, and translating the warnings against following the path of desires, as it opens on page 294.

Prioritizing Core Doctrines

I'm now focusing on the fundamental principles distinguishing Ahl al-Sunnah wa al-Jama'ah from Ahl al-Ahwa. The text emphasizes adhering to the Book, Sunnah, and the practices of the Salaf, underscoring the importance of Istiqamah (steadfastness) even without worldly gains. I'm translating warnings against the path of desires, referencing verses and Hadiths.

Clarifying Methodological Distinctions

I'm now focusing on distinguishing the methodologies of Ahl al-Sunnah wa al-Jama'ah and Ahl al-Ahwa. The former emphasizes unwavering adherence to the Book, Sunnah, and Salaf's practices, not worldly gains. Conversely, Ahl al-Ahwa prioritizes achieving goals regardless of means, even if forbidden. I'm translating this key passage from page 294, highlighting contrasting principles.

Distinguishing Core Methodologies

I'm now focusing on contrasting methodologies, translating how Ahl al-Sunnah prioritize adherence to scripture and tradition, even without worldly benefits. I'm focusing on translating the warning against seeking power via corrupt means, even at the expense of human life, and highlighting how democracy and alliances with non-Muslims are condemned as detours from the correct path. This is all from page 294.

Summarizing Core Principles

I'm now focusing on the distinction between the methodologies of Ahl al-Sunnah and Ahl al-Ahwa. I'm translating the text's emphasis on uprightness, even without worldly success. The warning against those who prioritize their goals, even through forbidden means, is now my key focus. The translation on page 294 is progressing, with attention to the specific condemnation of "hurling the ugliest words" as a means of achieving a goal.

Clarifying Terminology Usage

I'm now clarifying the use of specific terms. For "shrines" and "amulets" I'll use those translations directly, and "Taghut" will remain as is. I have also decided that "Hizb al-Lat (Hezbollah)" is the best way to keep the tone, as the insults are against the author. I'm maintaining accuracy, ensuring that Istiqamah translates to steadfastness. I am working on translating the passage.

Refining Methodological Nuances

I'm now refining the translation of contrasting methodologies, specifically Ahl al-Sunnah's steadfast adherence to scripture, even without worldly benefits. The translation on page 294 is nearly complete, and I'm ensuring accuracy and consistency in terminology, including "Taghut" and "Hizb al-Lat (Hezbollah)". I've also incorporated the author's condemnation of seeking goals through forbidden means and hurtful words.

Refining Contextual Translation

I've been re-reading and analyzing "yabnuna" vs "yubayyinuna" on page 294. "Clarify" aligns best with the author's intent, and the warning against the methodology of "Ahl al-Ahwa". Maintaining accuracy is key, and context validates the choice. The original "build" made no sense. I've re-examined and confirmed. I am now working on translating the Arabic from page 294.

I’m focusing on translating the Arabic text. It’s in a file noted as "/mnt/data/pasted.txt." There’s a real emphasis on preserving the chain of narration with correct transliteration, and we need to respect specific translations, like keeping "Allah" instead of "God." I'll also account for the correct salutation formatting.

Preparing the translation and formatting details
I need to make sure the output includes no Arabic characters except for ﷺ, while preserving IDs like "P316a" and numeric markers. The Qur'anic verse will be translated without Arabic script, and I’ll include the filecite token in plain text. I’ll revise it three times internally. Integration will be precise and follow instructions strictly.

Preparing translation and transliteration approach
I'm translating the verse, "And the evil plot encompasses none but its own people," and I’ll include the Surah name, "Fāṭir: 43" with ALA-LC transliteration. Arabic letters won't be used, so I’ll stick to transliterating all content, including names like "Sālim al-Ṭawīl," where appropriate.

Deciding on transliteration approach for names
The instruction seems to focus on using ALA-LC transliteration only for narrators in the isnad, not for the textual content. While I could transliterate other Arabic proper nouns, it might be clearer and safer to use standard English spellings for those. I could include diacritics for specific names where needed, though.

Transliteration and terminology approach
The instructions specify using ALA-LC transliteration for narrator names in the chain, so I’ll follow that. For other Arabic names or terms, I could use standard transliterations, but I’ll stick with ALA-LC for consistency and professionalism. For specific Islamic terms like "manhaj" or "ʿaqīdah," I'll keep them as is, ensuring accuracy without adding extra commentary.

Translating terms and maintaining consistency
We'll use "manhaj" for "methodology" and make sure to keep technical terms like "tazkiyah" and "ʿaqīdah" transliterated as needed, while prioritizing their meaning. For terms like "al-Turāth" and "Qarmaṭians," we’ll stick with transliterations as per the guidelines. Arabic-Indic digits should be translated to Western digits like 250. I'll include citations correctly at the end.

Handling citation placement in the response
The instructions specify citing the file, but the user prefers only the translation, no extra details. The citation needs to be placed within the text itself, likely at the end of the first sentence or segment, as it's derived from the file. I'll ensure this fits seamlessly with the translation.

Considering citation placement and translation details
To avoid clutter, I think it’s best to add the citation to the end of the first segment, keeping it inline rather than on a separate line. I'll stick to the user's request for translation only. I'll ensure each segment begins with its proper ID, and there will be no Arabic but careful attention to rhetorical aspects in translation.

Translating Arabic phrases and maintaining clarity
I'm translating the phrase "وإني- والحمد لله رب العالمين- أستفدت كثيراً من ردوده" as "And I—praise be to Allah, Lord of the worlds—have benefited greatly...". Regarding terms like "mukhālifīn," I think I can either keep it as is for its technical meaning or translate as “those in opposition.” I’ll stick to clear, readable translations where possible while keeping the technical terms intact.

Translating and considering familiar terms
The quote could be translated as: "One notices with many of the مخالفين their eagerness for tazkiyāt, as they seek to attract attention by actions like visiting the mashāyikh (scholars) or praising the shaykh. This isn't a valid tazkiyah until it comes from a scholar or their actions and speech support it." I'll use "shaykhs" for "mashāyikh."

Breaking down religious terminology and clarity
The message discusses the issue of declaring someone a kāfir (disbeliever) or not, using well-known Islamic terms like kufr (disbelief) and takfīr (declaring someone a disbeliever). It suggests that declaring a specific person as a kāfir is not always obligatory, unless the situation clearly aligns with established Islamic principles. It goes into depth about Bashshār al-Asad and the Nusayrī beliefs.

Clarifying religious and political views
The discussion surrounds the issue of whether Bashshār is a kāfir (disbeliever) or not and how to approach declaring someone as such. There's an emphasis on the Nusayrī beliefs and the actions of certain groups, with critiques of those who are hesitant to label them as innovators. The challenge lies in understanding differing stances and whether scholars explicitly declared these individuals as innovators or not.

Translating Segments with Attention to Detail
I'll translate as clearly as possible, especially considering the user's specific instructions. For example, "Glory be to Allah" instead of "Subḥān." I'll use "I ask Allah for well-being" for "أسأل الله العافية" and "and Allah knows best" for "والله أعلم." I'll write each segment in plain text, keeping prior instructions in mind and including filecite only when necessary. I'll stay mindful of Salafi-specific terms like "madrasah" for "مدرسة."

Translating terms and context carefully
I'll translate "madrasah" as "the school" to capture its meaning, along with "manhaj of refutation" and other phrases like "his knowledge is spread." For "أشرطته," "tapes" works for audio recordings. I'll also use "the ilzāmāt (obligations)" for "إلزامات," opting for "objections" to keep it clear. The translation will reflect the intended context while staying as literal as possible.

Translating Islamic terms with clarity
For "أسقطه من الصراط المستقيم," I'll translate it as “deemed him fallen from the Straight Path.” "المذبذب" works as "vacillator," and "المخذل" as "discourager." For "التبديع," I’ll decide to use "declaring someone an innovator" with some context. Also, I'll include Arabic terms like "manhaj" and "takfīr" in parentheses when needed.

Translating Arabic with attention to context and terminology
I need to translate the Arabic text, maintaining accuracy and using the correct Islamic terms like manhaj instead of just "God" for Allah. I'll keep the IDs at the beginning, and for names of narrators in the hadith chain, I'll use ALA-LC transliteration. Since this text lacks a chain, I may transliterate the proper names.

Translating names and adhering to rules
The instruction specifies using ALA-LC only for narrators in a hadith chain, but it doesn't clarify for other names. To be safe, I'll use established English forms without diacritics for non-narrator names. However, for scholars, using ALA-LC transliteration—even outside the chain—seems acceptable. Maintaining consistency is key.

Handling transliteration and translation per instructions
The instructions specify ALA-LC only for narrators in the chain, so other names can use standard English forms without diacritics, though this may affect accuracy. We must also avoid Arabic characters in the text, so Quranic verses and hadith must be translated, including references to Surahs and verses. I'll adjust as needed.

Consistency with honorifics and names
The instructions say to use ﷺ for "صلى الله عليه وسلم". For similar phrases like "عليه الصلاة والسلام", I should likely use ﷺ too, even though it's not explicitly required. For consistency, I'll keep placeholders like "the Prophet ﷺ". I'll also transliterate "lā ilāha illā Allāh" as needed.

Translating technical terms and quotes
I need to translate "إله" as "ilāh" and keep "Allah" for religious context. Terms like "manhaj," "ḥizbī,” "mubtadiʿ" (innovator), and "tazkiyah" should stay transliterated for technical accuracy. I'll translate hadith quotes like "From the excellence of a person's Islam is his leaving that which does not concern him" as required.

Translating Arabic terms and phrases
I need to adjust Arabic references like "لقاء الباب المفتوح" to "Liqaʾ al-Bāb al-Maftūḥ," using Western digits when needed, like [67]. I'll keep transliterations for surah and personal names as required. For terms like "tazkiyah" or "tabdīʿ," a balance of transliteration and literal translation will help preserve meaning clearly.

Translating honorifics and keeping accuracy
For the phrase "صلى الله عليه وعلى آله وسلم", I will keep the standardized "ﷺ" for the honorific but need to balance accuracy. While "the Messenger ﷺ" seems best in most cases, I could opt for "the Messenger ﷺ and his family" for a bit more clarity. I'll follow guidelines and avoid adding unnecessary formatting.

Translating terms and ensuring accuracy
I'll keep "ﷺ" for the Messenger of Allah and include "and upon his family" for clarity when necessary. For term consistency, I'll use "Muḥammad" with diacritics and keep technical terms like "iḥsān" transliterated while giving the translation for clarity. I'll stick to clear, concise choices to avoid confusion.

Translating teachings on fairness and criticism
The quote stresses that while no one is free from making mistakes, we should focus on a person’s accomplishments instead of dwelling on their flaws. Criticism should be about the action, not the individual. It's wise to avoid partisanship and instead guide others toward truth.

Addressing divisions and the importance of knowledge
Many people are unaware of the core principles of Islam, like the meaning of "lā ilāha illā Allāh," its conditions, and what can nullify it. This lack of knowledge has led to division and harm, especially due to partisanship. It's crucial for scholars to advise seeking knowledge in key Islamic disciplines and focus efforts on constructive goals.

Addressing the Syrian conflict and guiding principles
The speaker reflects on the Syrian conflict, opposing revolutions and the Arab Spring, emphasizing the need for guidance from scholars who avoid fitnah. They refused involvement in fighting, citing advice from scholars to avoid the conflict. Questions follow about stances on factions like ISIS vs. al-Nuṣrah.

Clarifying views on Jabhat al-Nuṣrah and ISIS
The speaker asks for clarity on whether Jabhat al-Nuṣrah is considered a Sunni faction and the difference between ISIS and al-Nuṣrah, asking about the classification of both groups. The discussion includes whether they are considered Khawārij, how to handle those supporting these groups, and guidance on repentance from deviation.

Translating key phrases and statements
The focus here is translating specific Arabic phrases and quotes accurately, keeping consistency and delicacy in the translation. Key elements include the proper use of terms like "tawḥīd", "Ahl al-Sunnah", "ḥadīth", and "fāsiq", while ensuring clarity without adding interpretive language. The translation should remain literal in contexts related to Islamic terminology, letting the meaning come through clearly.

Deciding on transliteration and translation choices
Okay, so I need to follow the guidelines: I should preserve ALA-LC transliteration for narrator names, but use common English spellings elsewhere. Arabic should only be transliterated when referring to narrators and kept for specific symbols like ﷺ. For Quranic phrases, I'll translate "الله تعالى" as Allah Most High, and "لا إله إلا هو" as "none has the right to be worshipped but Him." I'll include diacritics when necessary.

Clarifying transliteration for technical terms
Okay, I need to follow the rule not using Arabic characters, but Latin with diacritics is fine. For "ilāh", I’ll use the transliteration without italics, since it’s a technical term, not a narrator. As for terms like "ʿaqīdah" and "manhaj", I'll transliterate them with diacritics because it's required to maintain the correct Islamic technical terminology. Let’s stick to ALA-LC rules here.

Following transliteration guidelines
Okay, ALA-LC transliteration uses diacritics like ʿ, ḥ, which is fine for terms like ʿaqīdah and manhaj. For "الخوارج," we'll use "Khawārij," and "النصيري" could be "Nusayrī" or "Nuṣayrī" with diacritics. However, the guidelines strictly say only transliterate narrator names in the chain, so I’ll stick to that approach for consistency.

Deciding on transliteration for names and terms
The guidelines are clear for names in chains, so no diacritics on personal names. For Islamic technical terms like ʿaqīdah and manhaj, I’ll likely keep them in transliteration, since they expect accuracy with such terminology. However, since they specifically mention transliterating narrator names only, I’ll stay cautious and limit the usage of transliteration to those names only.

Balancing translation and citation requirements
I’ll transliterate names in chains, like "Salim al-Tawil," using standard spellings, and avoid diacritics for technical terms like "Khawarij" or "aqeedah." For citations, I’ll include them, but in a discreet way at the end, following system instructions, while adhering to the user's request for only the translation. I'll place them at the end, without "Source.”

Translating and maintaining structure
For the translation, I'll preserve the ID structure for each segment and translate accordingly. Since lines 21-25 are not labeled but seem like a continuation of P349g, I'll treat them as part of that segment without adding a new ID. I'll keep the formatting consistent, translating the content while respecting the original structure.

Translating the Islamic phrase accurately
For the phrase "صلى الله وسلم وبارك على نبيه محمد," the translation would generally be "may Allah send prayers, peace, and blessings upon His Prophet Muhammad." Since the instructions specify using ﷺ only for "صلى الله عليه وسلم," I'll avoid adding ﷺ here, despite the similar meaning.

Deciding on using ﷺ in translation
The phrase "صلى الله وسلم وبارك على نبيه محمد" translates as "May Allah send prayers, peace, and blessings upon His Prophet Muhammad," without needing to include ﷺ. While the instructions specify using ﷺ only when "صلى الله عليه وسلم" appears, I might add it when explicitly referring to Prophet Muhammad to maintain respect, but only in that context.

Maintaining translation guidelines and structure
For "نبيه محمد," we'll write "Muhammad ﷺ" since we’re referring to the Prophet. The translation of Quranic verses is literal, so we'll translate the verse in braces (Quran 6:129), ensuring no Arabic characters are included. We'll preserve the formatting, keeping the braces around the English translation. We'll also translate terms like "Sykes-Picot" and "بلاد الحرمين" while maintaining their original structures.

Translating technical terms and names
For the Arabic technical terms like "أهل السنة," I'll use "Ahl al-Sunnah" without transliterating it. Other common groups like "داعش" will be "Daesh," and "القاعدة" will be "al-Qa'idah." I'll translate "الجيش الحر" as "the Free Syrian Army." For names like "بشار," I'll translate it as "Bashar the Nusayri." I'll keep the translations consistent for clarity.

Crafting translation for clarity and punctuation
The translation should maintain clarity with appropriate punctuation. For example, “al-Sham” should be translated as "Greater Syria." In the passage, a question is asked about supporting Sunni factions in al-Sham, referencing the Free Syrian Army and Jabhat al-Nusrah after regime changes. Proper flow and punctuation will be important for understanding. I'll review the sections to ensure clarity and consistency in message.

Clarifying terms and translating technical wording
This passage needs technical terms to be properly translated. For example, "عقيدة الخوارج" can be best translated as "the aqeedah of the Khawarij," maintaining its contextual meaning. In the discussion, it’s important to keep phrases like "aqeedah and manhaj" consistent. The main focus is translating questions about support for factions in Syria and their alignment with various beliefs.

Clarifying and translating the conflict questions
This passage discusses real conflicts in Saudi Arabia, Libya, Egypt, Tunisia, and Yemen, detailing wars between various factions and state armies. The author poses questions about alignment with these factions, especially regarding ongoing skirmishes. It’s important to ensure the translated terms remain neutral and respectful, as the text presents sensitive topics.

Maintaining respect and addressing conflict
The author writes to defend their stance, stating they will publish their article but will refrain from including exact words of insult for the sake of respect. They emphasize not having insulted the recipient and claim insults are a sign of lacking evidence. They also contrast the recipient’s behavior with others who would retaliate directly.

Addressing disappointment and seeking guidance
The writer expresses confusion and disappointment, questioning how an imam and khatib could behave this way despite leading people in prayer. They mention sending the imam's behavior to another religious figure for advice, without knowing if the imam benefited from it. The writer also prays for guidance.

Questioning support for Syrian groups and accountability
The writer recounts questioning Shaykh Nasir about his support for a group in Syria, as he was involved in collecting donations for them. The response was evasive. The writer argues that donors' contributions should not support terrorist groups like Daesh or al-Qa'idah and stresses the importance of transparency about where the money goes.

Examining support for Jabhat al-Nusrah and related groups
The writer questions the stance on Jabhat al-Nusrah, al-Qa'idah, and Daesh, comparing them to past arguments about seeking help from America against Iraq. They argue that these groups, which threaten Muslims, should not be supported under any circumstances, warning against the dangers they pose to Muslim communities.

Opposing extremist groups and clarifying views
The writer condemns support for extremist groups like Daesh, Jabhat al-Nusrah, and al-Qa'idah, highlighting the importance of denouncing all forms of support for them. They cite Islamic scholars, emphasizing that cooperating with non-believers to stop corruption or repel aggression is acceptable, but supporting extremists is not.

Verifying translation details and formatting
The translation involves ensuring proper punctuation, quote marks, and conversion of Arabic-Indic digits to Western ones. I'll keep technical terms like "wilayah" and "kufr" while ensuring translations remain accessible. Complex terms like "mظاهرة" are translated as "aid and support." I'll also convert page references and handle Arabic terms consistently, translating where needed and maintaining plain text.

I'm currently honing my translation strategy. Analyzing the request, I'm taking into account my role as a specialist in Islamic content and the nature of the source material. I'm focusing on accurately representing the nuances of Salim al-Tawil's Fatawa/articles. The goal is a faithful and expert English translation.

Defining Translation Parameters

I've established key translation parameters for this project. My focus is on achieving a high degree of accuracy for English-speaking audiences. This includes preserving technical Islamic terms and ensuring that the formatting aligns perfectly with provided guidelines. I'm also implementing a three-pass review process, starting with aligning IDs and ending with a final transliteration check.

Approaching Specific Content

I'm now fully immersed in the specific content. I've begun working with the provided Du'a. I've translated it and am now focusing on refining the English. Also I have started the Arabic text translation, and focusing on accuracy and preservation of meaning and nuances. I'm prioritizing accuracy in representing the original. This involves careful consideration of the context and the key terms provided in the prompt.

Analyzing the Accusation

I'm currently dissecting the rumors about my alleged warning against Abu 'Uthman's classes. I find this news incredibly perplexing, primarily because I have no recollection of such warnings, and, more significantly, I'm unaware of any scholarly classes he conducts to begin with. The focus now is to detail my astonishment at the situation and to establish my perspective on his relative level of knowledge.

Dissecting the Allegation

I'm now fully dissecting the accusation of warning against Abu 'Uthman's classes. My analysis continues to highlight the absurdity, as his lectures are minimal and often involve merely introductions. He seemingly struggles to teach, even bringing in others. It's a truly baffling claim, especially considering some of his followers avoid my mosque. This suggests the accusation may be a projection of his own actions, a deflection of his actual position.

Clarifying My Stance

My current focus is clarifying my position on the 'Anjari matter. I'm categorically stating I don't warn against his classes, assuming they exist, or against attending them. Anyone who wishes to participate is free to do so. Any previous statements that contradict this are now nullified. I also wish to stress that I do not engage in behind-the-scenes actions.

Evaluating the Source

I'm now analyzing the Hadith from Ibn Abi Mulaykah. The focus is on contextualizing the text "How ugly it is for a person to be eager for praise and commendation." I'm evaluating its potential for use in a broader theological discussion. It seems relevant to discussions around humility and self-perception, especially within the context of Islamic scholarship and leadership.

Contemplating Deeper Implications

I'm now fully engaged in the implications of loving praise for what one hasn't earned. I'm considering the verses and the companions' concern with hypocrisy, the hadith from Ibn Abi Mulaykah, and the related hadith from Hanzalah and Abu Bakr. This is crucial for my understanding of how such motivations might manifest in real-world scenarios. It's becoming evident how important it is to be aware of the internal and external threats to sincerity.

Examining Hanzalah's Experience

I'm now contemplating Hanzalah's statement and the Prophet's ﷺ response. This hadith presents a profound exploration of human nature's inconsistency. The core dilemma: How does one maintain spiritual focus amidst daily distractions? The Prophet's ﷺ compassion resonates powerfully, acknowledging this inherent struggle. I find myself further examining the interplay between these two states to understand the path to consistency.

Addressing Self-Proclaimed Purity

I am now thoroughly examining the concept of self-proclaimed 'pure' Salafism. The thought that certain individuals confidently label themselves and their group as such, seemingly without hesitation, is concerning. The irony is that their ignorance may be the source of their certainty. I'm focusing on why a complete understanding of Salafism is missing in these individuals.

Contrasting Self-Perception

I am now thoroughly wrestling with the dangers of self-deception and the love of praise. I'm focusing on the stark contrast between outward righteousness and inner reality, particularly concerning the anecdote about the 'Salaf' who humbly accepted a woman's rebuke. This contrasts sharply with those today who bristle at even the slightest criticism. It underscores the critical need for Muslims to be deeply wary of seeking praise and commendation.

Delving Deeper into Praise

I'm now completely engaged in the implications of seeking praise, a theme threaded through the teachings of Islam. The emphasis is on understanding how praise corrupts intentions. I'm focused on the destructive power of excessive praise, how it fosters a sense of self-importance and the potential idolatry of the self. I'm examining the Hadith from Abu Bakrah, emphasizing the Prophet's ﷺ strong warning against flattery. This reinforces the need for humility and the inherent dangers of unchecked ego.

Defining Praise Parameters

I'm now clarifying the parameters of permitted praise and its potential pitfalls. I'm focusing on the necessity of praise in certain contexts. I must avoid certainty in praising others, because I don't know if the person deserves it or not. I'm also examining the implications of praise in Islamic contexts and how to maintain sincerity.

Defining the Obligation

I'm presently focusing on the Muslim's obligation to act solely for Allah, not seeking validation from others. Examining the verse from An-Nisa, I'm analyzing the dangers of relying on external commendations. These are fallible, and cannot truly gauge the inner state. It underscores the importance of sincere action, independent of any external praise or recognition.

Assessing Self-Proclaimed Salafis

I'm now grappling with the disconcerting trend of self-proclamations of Salafi identity and evaluating their implications. Examining their conduct, I observe a disparity between outward presentations and internal realities, especially manifested in their speech and gatherings. The focus is on the crucial need for consistent action aligned with genuine knowledge, dedication, and moral principles.

Reviewing Current Trends

I am now closely examining the current trend of self-proclaimed Salafis who focus on gossip and classification, prioritizing external commendation over true adherence to Salafi principles. I'm focusing on the importance of genuine knowledge and consistent action, not just the superficial aspects. This involves introspecting on my own intentions and actions to ensure they align with the core values of Salafism.

Examining Praise Exploitation

I'm now deeply analyzing the manipulation of commendations by certain individuals, including those claiming a Salafi identity. I'm focusing on the hypocrisy of using praise to deflect criticism while concealing problematic views. The specific example of the person who followed his self-praise with the phrase "and I do not purify myself" highlights the contradiction.

Contrasting Self-Justification

I am now thoroughly analyzing the contradictions in praise and self-justification. Considering the individual's closing statement, "And I do not purify myself," alongside their prior self-commendation, I am struck by the hypocrisy. This echoes the sentiment from the Hadith of Al-Bukhari, where a person claims not to backbite even while doing so. My focus is on the blatant disconnect between words and actions. I'm moving on to analyzing the remaining text.

Analyzing Textual Nuances

I'm now diving deep into the complexities of the provided questions and text. Analyzing the questions, the focus is on the nuances of "Ya lal-Muhajirin," "Ya lal-Ansar," and their potential relation to partisanship. It's crucial to understand how the companions' statements relate to Quranic concepts. Also, I'm examining the inquiry about attending courses by organizations that the sheikh advises against.

Addressing Misinterpretations

I'm presently refuting the accusations of partisanship. The use of the Companions' falling into partisanship, as mentioned in the text, is not an attack. Sheikh 'Abd al-'Aziz al-Rajhi endorsed it as valid. Furthermore, the scholar Muqbil al-Wadi'i also used the same Hadith to condemn partisanship. I'm focusing on clarifying that my statement aligns with accepted scholarly views.

Exposing Partisan Accusations

My thoughts are now firmly focused on refuting the false claims of partisanship. They used the same Hadith as evidence for disparaging partisanship, and I quoted his speech to them, but they persisted that I am attacking the Companions!! The matter is very clear that they only wanted revenge because I criticized them regarding their statement about Bashar al-Assad being a (Sunni Muslim)!!

Addressing Partisan Misunderstandings

I'm now fully engaged in dispelling the unfounded accusations of attacking the Companions. It's beyond comprehension to suggest such a thing. My stance aligns with established scholarly consensus. Anyone accusing me of attacking the Companions is either a heretic or a Rafidi. I'm focusing on clarifying that I condemn the call of Jahiliyyah, just as the Prophet ﷺ did. The focus now is on explaining that simply referencing the Companions' words does not constitute an attack, and I am waiting for their answer.

Analyzing Nuanced Disagreement

I am now thoroughly analyzing the question regarding attending courses from organizations I warn against, focusing on the potential for misinterpretation. My response clearly acknowledges the question and clarifies my stance: while I may warn against these organizations, I do not necessarily forbid attending their courses. My emphasis is on the individual's freedom of choice and my role as an advisor, not a dictatorial authority.

Processing Remaining Content

I am now thoroughly processing all remaining content, focusing on accuracy. My goal is to ensure a cohesive and expert presentation of the subject matter. The focus is now on refining specific terms and phrases. I'm also ensuring a consistent tone and style throughout the summary. I'm prioritizing accuracy and clarity.

Defining Precise Translations

I am now carefully working on providing a precise translation for key terms. I'm focusing on consistency, particularly around "Tazkiyah," understanding its nuances and context. I'll translate the Hadith as "I do not sanctify anyone above Allah." The translation of "yuzakki" will be "commend." The goal is accurate and easily understandable content.

Finalizing Terminology Refinements

I am now fine-tuning the selected translations, aiming for consistency. I've chosen to use "sanctify" for the root "z-k-y" when referring to divine actions in the Hadith and verse, and "commend" for its broader application in human contexts, like seeking praise (Tazkiyah). The goal is to convey the intended meaning and preserve nuance effectively.

Defining Consistent Translation

I am now striving for the perfect translation of "Tazkiyah," avoiding inconsistency and preserving context. I am leaning toward "commend/vindicate" for its broader applications, while keeping "purify" for Allah's actions. The interplay between these translations is vital in this analysis. I will finalize this definition, focusing on the connection between praise and self-purification.

Clarifying Terminology Usage

I'm now fully immersed in ensuring semantic precision. I've chosen to employ "commend" for human actions and interactions, particularly within the context of "Tazkiyah," and "purify" for divine actions. This distinction aids in accurately conveying the intended meaning across various sections, including Hadith and verse. I am confident that these distinctions will prevent misinterpretations.

I need to translate Arabic to English, ensuring no Arabic characters except ﷺ, and apply ALA-LC transliteration only to narrator names. Since there is a Qur'anic verse, I'll translate that and convert Arabic-Indic digits to Western ones. I’ll keep references in transliteration, like [al-Nisāʾ: 142], but not for sura names.

Translating Arabic names beyond narrators
The instruction seems to apply ALA-LC transliteration only to narrators in chains, but doesn’t mention other Arabic names. While it’s likely that Arabic names like Rabīʿ, Ṣaddām Ḥusayn, and others might be transliterated using ALA-LC for consistency, the directive specifically addresses narrators in chains, so this might clarify the approach.

Translating with consistency and caution
Since there are no isnad segments, I can transliterate Arabic names using ALA-LC, but I’ll be sure to avoid Arabic letters and keep consistency. Diacritics are important for titles like Shaykh. For terms like takfīr or tawḥīd, I'll provide literal translations. I'll also convert references, like [al-Nisāʾ: 142], into English while keeping transliteration for book titles.

Consistent translation and phrasing choices
For quoting al-Albānī, I'll make sure to keep punctuation and exclamation marks while translating phrases like "سلطة عمان" as "Sultanate of Oman". "الإخوة" translates to "brothers," and "حفظهما الله تعالى" should be "may Allah Most High preserve them." I'll use terms like "Allah, Mighty and Majestic" and "Allah forbid" consistently, while translating "Rāfiḍī Bāṭinī" as "Rāfiḍī esoteric (Shiʿite)", with diacritics where applicable.

Consistent translation of technical and cultural terms
For terms like "Rāfiḍī", I’ll use the transliteration with an explanatory note (e.g., "Rāfiḍī esoteric"). Words like "Nāṣirī" will be translated as "Nuṣayriyyah" for accuracy. I’ll use "Sunnī" for "سنّي" and "People of the Book" for "الكتابي", ensuring cultural context is respected. For exclamations like "الله أكبر," I’ll translate it as "Allah is the Greatest." I'll stick to the instructions about Arabic characters, preserving ﷺ as a symbol where appropriate.

Translating consistent terms and names
For phrases like "السمع والطاعة" it's best to keep "to hear and obey," as it's a technical term. I'll make sure to unify translations like "سلطة عمان" and "سلطنة عمان," translating both as "Sultanate of Oman." I’ll adjust Arabic digits to Western ones and ensure consistency with names like "Rabīʿ," "ʿUbayd," and "Bashshār al-Asad" using ALA-LC transliteration. I'll likewise translate Qur'anic quotes, and ensure consistency throughout.

Finalizing transliteration and translation consistency
For terms like "Ḥizb Allāh," I'll use "Hizbullah (the Lebanese) Bāṭinī" for clarity. Transliteration for names like "al-Naṣīriyyah" and "Sunnī" will be consistent, and I’ll use diacritics where needed. I'll ensure that technical terms like "tawḥīd" and "Dāʿish" are accurately translated without Arabic characters. Punctuation and formatting will match the original.

I'm currently focused on the specific request details. My initial analysis is underway, ensuring I grasp the scope of the task. The role is defined, as is the source material. I need to understand the nuances of the Fatawa/articles to ensure accurate translation.

Clarifying Translation Goals

I've refined my translation objectives based on the provided details. Accuracy is paramount, especially regarding Islamic terminology and preservation of isnads. I've noted specific guidelines for transliteration, capitalization of chapter headings, and the treatment of Arabic characters (only keeping ﷺ). I'll adhere to the three-pass revision process and the requirement for plain text output, keeping the identifiers intact. My aim is a faithful and precise translation.

Analyzing Key Concepts Further

I'm now diving deeper into the core concepts. The contradictions within these viewpoints are significant and require careful handling. Salafiyyah and the nuances of declaring someone an innovator are central themes. I'm exploring the referenced figures, particularly Dr. Tariq al-Subay'i's role, in relation to Manhaj. The upcoming article's content regarding conflicts is noted, which will need very careful context.

Deconstructing Zayd's Viewpoint

I'm now examining Zayd's claims about innovation, specifically its impact on accepted deeds. His pronouncements on rejecting deeds due to bid'ah are concerning, particularly the potential for Takfir implied in his statements. I'm carefully comparing his views to the established Ahl al-Sunnah perspective on this matter, which distinguishes between minor and major forms of innovation. I see clear contradictions. The overall group's resistance to criticism also stands out, and I'm noting the comparisons made by Al-Tawil to other figures.

Refuting Al-Haddad's Claims

I'm now grappling with the Haddadiyyah sect and their problematic view that bid'ah invalidates righteous deeds like Jihad and prayer. Shaykh Rabi' al-Madkhali's refutation is central, clarifying that only Kufr invalidates all deeds. I'm noting the parallel to Khawarij methodology and their misapplication of verses. I've also identified their inconsistency regarding Bashar al-Assad. Next, I am reviewing a letter to Bin Ramzan al-Hajiri, focusing on Al-Tawil's response to his criticisms of those who criticized Zayd. Al-Tawil is defending the duty to critique falsehood.

Examining Contradictions

I'm now analyzing the contradiction inherent in Dr. Khalid al-Zafiri's actions: dining with Ihya' al-Turath members, whom he typically labels as innovators. The historical context, particularly the split within Kuwaiti Salafism due to Ihya' al-Turath's political involvement, is critical. I'm noting key figures and the evolution of Salafi thought in Kuwait over the past 40 years. This involves examining the "new crop" of less-educated Salafis, who cause division. I've also noted a direct question to Dr. Zafiri about this matter.

Translating with Precision

Currently, I'm meticulously refining my translation draft. I'm focusing on the ALA-LC transliteration, specifically for names like Zayd bin Ḥalīs al-Dawsarī and Khālid bin Ḍaḥwī al-Ẓafīrī. I'm carefully selecting the most accurate English equivalents for key terms. I've opted for "Revival of Heritage" to capture both the concept and the organization's name, a more specific detail than "Heritage Revival." I've corrected "Ma'sum" to "Infallible" to maintain the accurate theological context within the document.

Clarifying the Translation

I'm now grappling with the term "Al-Khawaj" in the provided text. After checking the source and considering context, I'm confident it's a typo for "Al-Khawarij" (Seceders). I've decided to translate it as such, but I'll also add a clarifying note to explain the discrepancy between the original text and the likely intended meaning. This is to ensure absolute accuracy and maintain fidelity to the source, even in the event of an error. I am now proceeding with this translation.

Revising Terminology

I've carefully considered the translated terms, focusing on Arabic names, and their rendering in English. I've double-checked the transliteration of names. I am finalizing the treatment of the term "Bataliyah". I've decided to choose "thugs/good-for-nothings" as it reflects the original meaning best in this context. I will also incorporate clarifying notes where necessary. This will ensure that accuracy is achieved while maintaining the proper flow of the text.

Defining Core Translation

I'm now focusing on specific terminologies and completing the plain text block. I've chosen "thugs/good-for-nothings" to translate "Bataliyah" to reflect the intended insult in Bin Ramzan's text. I've also verified the verse citations, and checked all occurrences of Salawat. Finally, I'm performing the first pass verification of all sections, ensuring accuracy across the entire piece.

Confirming Terminology Choices

I'm now solidifying my word choices and ensuring consistency. I've re-confirmed "Revival of Heritage" and "Partisan". I'm also ensuring the ALA-LC transliteration is correct and that the "Nusayri" designation is accurate. I've checked the sections again and made sure that headings are present and correctly capitalized. I'm focusing on the term "Bataliyah" and will check the translation of "thugs/good-for-nothings" to confirm that it accurately reflects the context.

I'm currently focused on the specific requirements, given I'm an Arabic-to-English translator with a specialty in Islamic content. The source is from Salim al-Tawil's website, and I'm ensuring I accurately capture the nuances of his fatawa and articles. Accuracy and appropriateness are paramount, and I'm considering cultural context to ensure an excellent translation.

Prioritizing Technical Accuracy

I've been meticulously analyzing the constraints, especially concerning technical terminology and the preservation of Isnad. Using ALA-LC for transliteration of narrator names is crucial, and I'm ensuring all the textual content is fully translated. I'm focusing on "Allah" instead of "God" (in specific cases), and keeping track of the plain-text output requirement, with IDs and prefixes intact. The chapter headings will be formatted correctly, and the three revision steps are locked in. I'm now moving to the first source text segment, P391f, to refine the process further.

Analyzing Contextual Implications

I'm presently dissecting the nuances of Sheikh al-Badr's visit, grappling with the implications of the "Mubham," "Inkar," and "Hizbiyyin" terms. The relationship between "Jarh" and association is central to this. I'm actively drafting, considering appropriate word choices. I'm focusing on accurately representing the critique while capturing the complexities of differing views on the "Turath" society. I'm looking at potential sources of the abbreviation "B.B." now. I also started the review of P391g: comparing the hosting of Sunnis versus innovators.

Discerning Nuances and Debate

I'm now grappling with the contentious terms and associated debates found in section P392. I'm carefully navigating the complexities of "Tabdi'," "Jarh wa Ta'dil," and "Hamil Liwa'," as well as their implications on differing views. I'm working through the specific example involving an Egyptian Sheikh's advice and its refutation, striving to accurately convey the essence of the arguments and context surrounding the concepts of innovation within a broader context. I'm focusing on preserving the original intent while carefully translating the subtleties of the exchange.

Synthesizing Complex Concepts

I'm now integrating the verses, hadith, and metaphors into the drafting process for P392b and P393. I'm focusing on crafting sentences that appropriately convey the nuanced arguments. I'm considering the interplay of "Tabdi'," infallibility, and boycotting. I'm carefully translating and structuring quotes from Ibn Taymiyyah and considering the context of the hadith about belief in Allah. Also, I'm integrating the relevant verses and hadith mentioned to strengthen the reasoning of the text.

Unpacking the Accusations

I'm presently unpacking the accusations within the open letter to Dr. Khalid, focusing on P393a-c. I'm focusing on the author's prior attempts at private communication, the abrupt "Hazr," and the content of the letter, specifically the complaints of backbiting. I'm carefully translating the phrase "They are being punished..." which references a hadith on grave punishment for backbiters. The author's strong criticism of Dr. Khalid's actions and the potential implications of the accusations require nuanced word choices. I'm grappling with the significance of terms like "Fasiq," "Ghibah," and the mention of extremist figures' association with Bashar al-Assad, to accurately represent the criticism.

Analyzing Final Sections

I'm now focusing on the final portions of the text. I'm carefully translating the sarcastic usage of "Aqhah" and the critical phrasing about verifying information. I'm focusing on the conclusion, "Follow me in upcoming articles," and the context of the interaction regarding 'Uthman al-Khamis and the trip to Yemen. I'm also grappling with the key term "Tafarras" and drafting sentences about the author's background and intentions, including a discussion of the author's potential links to the Jam'iyyat Ihya al-Turath organization.

Dissecting Accusations Further

I'm now carefully working through P394, analyzing the author's argument. I'm focusing on the Yemeni speech, the Hadith of Mu'adh, and the context of the Masjid of Sheikh Muqbil. I'm scrutinizing the inquiry to the "Sahab" forum and translating the concept of "Tazkiyah." I'm carefully translating the author's criticisms of Khalid, especially regarding his prior requests and the apparent "Talawwun." I'm also carefully handling the criticisms of Khalid's students.

Evaluating Philosophical Justification

I'm currently engaged with the philosophical justification, the "Caution is broader than warning" statement, and crafting the rebuttal. I'm focusing on Khalid's reaction to my arrival and his "yellow smile." The upcoming article teaser about Khalid's "Turathis" relationship is drafted. I'm also preparing for the new article, which will recap a past favor to establish a connection. I'm focusing on the term "Mann" and what it suggests about Khalid's stance.

Implementing Philosophical Nuance

I'm presently focused on the explicit verses and crafting the statements about the Quran and Sunnah. I'm carefully incorporating verse 21:26, 5:64, and 37:36-37 to support the argument. I'm drafting phrases like "Refraining from clarification is not from the methodology," and "I seek refuge in Allah for you to be from these categories." I'm also preparing for the three passes for refinement and technical checks.

Verifying Terminology Accuracy

I'm now implementing the ALA-LC transliterations for the scholars, especially Dahwi, Zafiri, Rabi, Baz, Uthman, Falah, Mandakar, and Wadi'i. I'm also confirming the revisions to text segment P391f and rephrasing the sentence involving Sheikh Abd al-Razzaq's visit. I'm ensuring all the changes are incorporated accurately. I have also corrected the translation involving Rabee' and al-Jarh wa Ta'dil. Moreover, the translation and formatting of the Ibn Taymiyyah quote, and especially the terms muwalah and mu'adah, are checked. The term "Tafarras" is checked and properly defined.

I’m translating Arabic text and need to follow the requirements carefully. The instruction is to use ALA-LC transliteration for names of narrators in a chain but not for authors or contemporaries. Here, I see names like سيد قطب and عبد الرحمن عبد الخالق, but they aren't part of a chain of narration, so I shouldn’t transliterate them.

Deciding on transliterating names in the translation
Okay, so the rule is to preserve ALA-LC transliteration for names in the isnad (narration chain). But for other names, it's unclear. Since the instruction doesn’t fully restrict transliterations outside the isnad, I think I’ll stick with transliterating all Arabic personal names, using ALA-LC for consistency. However, for common names, I might opt for standard romanization.

Clarifying transliteration and translation choices
It seems the instructions are asking for transliteration with ALA-LC for names in the isnad, but for other names, I could use the commonly known English versions. This might mean names like Abdullah can stay transliterated without excessive detail. For terms like "Allah" and "Ilah", I’ll translate the terms as instructed.

Deciding on translating salutation phrases
The instruction asks for translating "صلى الله عليه وسلم" with "ﷺ", but the phrase here is "وصلى الله وسلم", not exactly the same. It likely makes sense to keep it as “sent prayers and peace,” as it's not the formal salutation. However, I might still use "ﷺ" after Muḥammad to align with expectations.

Clarifying translation and citation rules
The instruction allows for using ﷺ when "صلى الله عليه وسلم” is present, so I’ll apply it after "our Prophet Muḥammad" where needed. For chapter headings, I’ll avoid Arabic characters and translate Qur'anic verses with the proper references like [al-Raʿd: 41]. I’ll also include the required citation string in plain text at the end.

Translating technical terms and maintaining accuracy
For terms like 'tawḥīd', 'ʿaqīdah', and others, I’ll transliterate them with diacritics (e.g., 'tawḥīd', 'ḥākimiyyah'). While keeping transliterations for technical terms seems right, I'll aim to balance literal translations for clarity. For phrases like "tawḥīd al-ḥākimiyyah", I'll keep the term transliterated and explain its meaning to maintain accuracy.

Translating phrases and maintaining accuracy
I'll translate phrases for meaning, e.g., "Whatever you can win with, play with it." The term "لعاب منافق" seems to refer to "the spittle of a hypocrite," so I'll keep it as that. For Islamic salutations, I’ll translate “al-salāmu ʿalaykum wa-raḥmatullāhi wa-barakātuh” as a literal greeting, respecting the request for meaning and accuracy. Also, I’ll ensure verse translations stay precise.

Translating verses and names with accuracy
For verse [al-Baqarah: 118], I'll translate "tashābahat qulūbuhum" as "Their hearts are alike." There’s a mix-up with the verse numbering, as [al-Anʿām: 158] should be 159, but since no corrections were requested, I’ll keep it as is. I'll translate other terms accordingly, like "Shaykh (ʿAbd Allāh)" and "Russia," while ensuring no Arabic characters, but maintaining diacritics on Latin letters.

Translating and ensuring ALA-LC consistency
I need to make sure I properly transliterate the names and terms provided. For example, names like Sālim ibn Saʿd al-Ṭawīl and Ṭāriq al-ʿĪsā will follow ALA-LC, while terms like Khawārij (for "الخوارج") or Ṣūfiyyah (for "Sufis") need attention, though the name "Erdoğan" may be kept as is for recognition over strict ALA-LC.

Translating P407a segment and letter content
I’ll start by translating the P407a segment: "I ask Allah Most High to guide them, and to spare us, and to spare them." After that, I’ll correctly translate "ملاحظة" as "Note:" and continue with the rest. I'll ensure I maintain proper formatting. The letter part discusses a request for information about a statement by Shaykh ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ʿAbd al-Khāliq. I'll include the closing prayers reverently in the translation as well.

Translating P408 and letter content
I’ll begin translating P408’s opening: starting with "Praise be to Allah alone..." and describing the fourth category of tawḥīd, tawḥīd al-ḥākimiyyah. The note follows that discusses Zayd ibn Rājiḥ al-Muṭayrī’s thoughts on the subject. The letter from Sālim ibn Saʿd al-Ṭawīl will be translated with attention to preserving the quotes and meaning. I’ll continue with the detailed sections that follow, covering rulings, democracy, and the critique of various political viewpoints.

Translating P409 sections and addressing key points
The phrase "It's clear to any observer..." will be translated carefully, preserving the quote. Moving forward to P409, I’ll translate an introduction praising Allah and discussing Shaykh Fayṣal’s letter on his treatise. I’ll then address his responses to Shaykh (ʿAbd Allāh)’s statements. The passage continues with discussions on ijtihād, denouncing errors, and advice for further reading. I’ll preserve verse quotes as translations where needed.

Translating and summarizing letter contents
The translator will keep important dates and phrases like "2-12-2013" and "29 Muḥarram 1435." Closing phrases will be translated with respect, using "our Prophet Muḥammad ﷺ." The letter continues with a description of Salafī brothers’ hardships in Russia, their daʿwah work, and criticisms they face. It emphasizes supporting them, providing advice, and refraining from harshness, despite disagreements. It recounts an intense critique against a brother based on his political stance, emphasizing the need for measured, respectful discussion.

I need to translate this content while keeping the segment IDs intact, but only using ALA-LC transliteration for narrators' names in the chain. The mentioned scholars aren't narrators, so no transliteration is needed for them. However, to stay accurate, I should probably use common English transliterations like Ibn al-Qayyim, Ibn Bāz, etc. for clarity.

Clarifying translation guidelines for text
I need to follow the guideline of using ALA-LC for narrators in the chain, but other names can use common English transliterations without diacritics. The Arabic script must be excluded, except for ﷺ, and Quranic verses must be translated. For numbering, I should convert Arabic-Indic digits to standard numbers, but I'll keep segment IDs in their original format.

Handling translation and formatting details
I need to convert numbers to Western digits (1-10) and use Latin letters for surah references like "Ṣād 38:5" but avoid Arabic characters. Translation for verses like "Indeed, this is an astonishing thing" should be in plain text. Similar treatment for hadiths, translating "Glad tidings to whoever kills them" while avoiding Arabic script.

Translating and handling technical terms
The instructions say to transliterate narrators' names in the chain, but not the textual content. However, for technical terms like "ʿaqīdah," "manhaj," and "al-jarḥ wa al-taʿdīl," transliterating them is acceptable since they are terms, not names of narrators. I'll avoid Arabic script and use "al-Madākhilah" or "the Madkhalīs" for "المدخلة."

Translating and handling names with accuracy
For names like "al-Ḥalabiyyah" or "ʿAlī al-Ḥalabī," I'm opting for common transliterations without diacritics. The instructions specify ALA-LC for narrators only, so I’ll avoid diacritics for non-narrator names like Ibn al-Qayyim or Ibn Taymiyyah. I'll also translate or render commonly known terms, keeping "ibn" and omitting markdown.

Handling citations and translations accurately
In the quoted text, I plan to translate Arabic phrases like "رحمه الله تعالى" to "may Allah have mercy on him," ensuring accuracy while avoiding violations of the no-Arabic rule. I'll also convert Arabic numbers to Western numerals (35/69), sticking to acceptable formats for sources. I'll avoid Arabic characters like "٣".

Handling citations and translating phrases
For the citation, I'll use "Majmu' al-Fatawa (35/69)" to maintain clarity. I'll include the quote on the siddiqs and martyrs, ensuring it’s properly translated. For the phrase "السلام عليكم", I'll say "Peace be upon you, and the mercy of Allah, and His blessings." I'll proceed with translating the letter in segments.

Translating sensitive details with care
I’ll ensure to translate names clearly, like "Ajdabiya" for مدينة إجدابيا and "the orphaned children" as "the orphaned children he departed and left behind in a rented residence." For terms like "المداخلة," I’ll use "Madkhalees" for consistency. "Operation al-Karama" will be kept as "Operation al-Karama (Dignity)", and provide accurate translations throughout.

Translating sensitive phrases carefully
I need to ensure the translation is precise. For example, "We shall litigate against you—there is no ilah except Allah—soon" would be better rendered as "we will take you to task, by Allah." I will also make sure to carefully handle phrases like "Ahl al-Sunnah wa al-Jama'ah" to maintain their meaning.

Clarifying misconceptions about innovation in Islam
I’m considering how, when one shaykh makes a strong statement about an individual’s innovation, some young followers might misunderstand. These followers could view the individual as the greatest threat to the Sunnah, overshadowing even others like Jews or atheists. They might overzealously scrutinize everything this person says or writes, often misinterpreting their words.

Describing misguided actions and misguided groups
Some individuals focus on attacking others, spreading reports—sometimes wrongly—to create harm, believing it will "purify" the land. Meanwhile, some others, even when observing acts of faith, might wrongly label individuals as "innovators" based on limited judgment. The letter reflects concerns about misguided attitudes and frustrations with the destructive direction of such practices.

I need to translate Arabic segments into English, making sure to avoid Arabic characters except for ﷺ. Since there's no isnad (chain of narration), I don’t think I need to transliterate the textual content. Only names of narrators should follow ALA-LC rules. For other names, should I default to conventional English or stick to ALA-LC?

Deciding on transliteration for Arabic names
The instructions say ALA-LC transliteration should apply only to narrator names in the chain, not the other text. So, should I use regular English forms for other names, or stick with transliteration? ALA-LC might be preferred, but it only uses diacritics for narrators. Keeping consistency seems important, though.

Handling names and translations for Islamic content
The instructions limit transliteration to narrators in the chain, likely to avoid clutter from diacritics. For other names, I should probably use standard forms like "Salim ibn Sa'd al-Tawil" or plain English. I’ll translate "Allah" as "Allah" and use ﷺ for صلى الله عليه وسلم without Arabic text, including Qur’an citations.

Translating "Bayt al-Maqdis" and related terms
For the term "بيت المقدس," I'll translate it as "Bayt al-Maqdis" or "Jerusalem." Since it’s not in a narrator's chain, I'll avoid diacritics. "Al-Quds" refers to Jerusalem, so I’ll use "Jerusalem" for that term. I'll keep references like P435 and P436a intact for consistency.

Considering citation and formatting for plain text
The user requested no headers, formatting, or Arabic characters, but the system asks for citations. I'll include the citation at the end, in plain text, without markdown. The special characters in the citation should be fine. I’ll also need to maintain numeric markers but will adjust them to English numerals (e.g., ١ to 1).

Handling numerals and technical terms in translation
For Arabic-Indic digits like ١, I should convert them to Latin digits (1, 2, etc.), since the user asks for no Arabic characters other than ﷺ. I’ll similarly translate Arabic script verses and technical terms, such as “Rāfiḍī” and “Batini,” into English without diacritics, staying consistent with the user’s instructions.

Deciding between translation and transliteration for Islamic terms
For terms like "tawhid" and "muwahhid," I need to balance clarity and precision. Though translation like "oneness of lordship" feels clearer, some terms are best left transliterated for technical accuracy. "Muwahhid" seems acceptable as transliteration, but I’ll avoid it where possible, leaning toward English for clarity.

Deciding on translation choices for terms and structure
The user prefers literal translations unless meaning is clearer with an alternative. For terms like "tawhid" or "kufr," I'll go with "one who affirms tawhid" or "committed kufr." I'll stay consistent with segment format by matching IDs and line breaks. I’ll write the translations clearly while avoiding Arabic script, keeping the formatting neat and plain-text.

Deciding on translating verses literally and handling terms
I'll go with a literal translation approach for these verses. For example, translating "لا يسأل عما يفعل وهم يسألون" as "He is not questioned about what He does, and they will be questioned." I'd use "ilah" in place of "God" for accuracy, but will consider whether "ilah" conflicts with using transliteration as it's a technical term.

Finalizing the translation approach
For translation, I'll use "deity" in place of "ilah" to stay clear of untranslated terms, sticking with plain English. I'll proceed with literal translations for verses like "أفنجعل المسلمين كالمجرمين" ("Then shall We make the Muslims like the criminals?"). I'll also make sure to handle specific Hadith and Hebrew names like "Isa" correctly. I'll preserve formatting changes as needed, like line breaks, before completing the final review.

Translating specific phrases and statements
For translation, I’ll keep certain terms like “millah” translated as “religion” instead of leaving the transliteration. I’ll use "Deity" when referring to "ilah" to keep it clear, and retain phrases like "the supplication must be directed by Allah the Exalted." I'll ensure I capture the context of each segment, explaining each important phrase as needed, like "friend of the Most Merciful" for "خليل الرحمن."

Translating key concepts and clarifying terms
I’ll focus on translating key phrases clearly, like “la ilaha illa Allah” as "There is no deity worthy of worship except Allah alone, with no partner." I'll also explain theological terms and correct misconceptions, such as distinguishing true tawhid from shirk (associating partners). Additionally, I’ll explain that acts like slaughtering should be for Allah alone, not for idols.

I’m thinking that names like "Aḥmad," "al-Ṭabarānī," and "al-Ḥākim" refer to collectors, not narrators in the chain. The phrase "رواه أحمد عن عبادة" suggests a chain from Aḥmad to ʿUbādah, so I’ll transliterate those two. For the Prophet, I’ll use "the Prophet ﷺ" without transliteration. Other names should be translated into common English.

Transliteration considerations for non-narrator names
I should only apply ALA-LC transliteration to the names of narrators in the chain, not textual content or non-chain names. For other names, it's better to use conventional English spellings (like Ibn Baz, al-Albani) without diacritics but retaining apostrophes, as diacritics are only for narrators in the chain.

Choosing English for non-chain names and technical terms
I’ll use simpler, anglicized names without diacritics for non-chain names like Shaykh al-Albani, Ibn Baz, and others. For technical terms like 'tawhid', 'aqeedah', and 'manhaj', I’ll translate or keep them in English transliteration as requested. The instruction specifies using Arabic terminology in English form, so I'll follow that approach.

Translating Quranic terms and verse references
I’ll use "the correct manhaj" and "tawhid" while preserving their meanings. For 'بدعة', I’ll transliterate as 'bid‘ah'. I'll also keep Quranic references in English transliteration for surah names (e.g., Surah al-Zumar) and use English numbers for Arabic numerals. When delivering verse references, I'll translate the verse meaning into English while retaining the reference style.

Translating and formatting text, hadith, and Quranic verses
For Quranic verses, I'll translate passages into plain English and keep the reference in transliterated format, such as [al-Zumar: 9]. I'll avoid Arabic characters and use English names for countries like Qatar, Saudi Arabia, etc. Hadith is translated literally but with preserved meaning. I'll keep specific punctuation like normal commas and avoid Arabic commas or script, using ﷺ as the only allowed Arabic character. I'll also translate chapter headings normally, avoiding all-uppercase formatting.

Translating and formatting hadith narrators
For hadith narrators, I’ll use ALA-LC transliteration with diacritics. This applies to narrators like ʿĀʾishah and ʿUbādah ibn al-Ṣāmit. Since ALA-LC doesn’t want Arabic script, I’ll keep the brackets for references without Arabic inside. For names like al-Bukhārī and Muslim, I'll transliterate them as they’re part of the transmission chain.

Translating and refining key phrases
For Prophet’s companions, I'll use ALA-LC for names like ʿĀʾishah. When translating verses like [Taha 114], I’ll keep the Surah names intact, such as Taha, al-Zumar, and Maryam, and provide standard translations. For terms like “إماماً متبعاً,” I’ll use "an imam to be followed" with nuance, translating idiomatic phrases like "ليخلو له الجو" as “so the field becomes clear for him.”

Translating terms and concepts carefully
The term "bid‘ah" isn’t applicable here, and I’ll clarify it’s not analogous to the Christian trinity. For phrases like "جهل مركب" (compound ignorance), I’ll translate it clearly, along with the hadith, and include the necessary isnād: “Narrated by Aḥmad from ʿUbādah...” For the oath formula, I'll explain the different particles used without including Arabic letters and describe the three-part oath properly in context, avoiding over-complication.

Translating and maintaining clarity on terms
I need to ensure that "Allah knows what is in my heart" is translated properly in the context, and Abu Arafah’s rhetorical question about bid‘ah is clear too. I'll keep the summary of Sufis and Rawafid’s bid‘ahs, and translate verses like "[Taha: 114]" smoothly. For the letter to Tariq al-Eisa and topics like Kuwait and the Muslim Brotherhood, I'll adhere to clear language, translating terms carefully and maintaining necessary emphasis. Time to ensure everything makes sense without Arabic numerals or punctuation.

I've initiated the analysis by dissecting the request. My focus is on the source, Arabic, specifically Islamic content (Fatawa of Salim al-Tawil). The target language is English, and the style must be professional, accurate, and literal. This information serves as the foundation upon which I will begin to formulate my approach.

Developing Translation Strategy

I've established key rules for the translation, including literal accuracy over stylistic preference, adherence to technical Islamic terminology, and specific formatting guidelines. I'm focusing on meticulous transliteration (ALA-LC for narrators) and the accurate rendering of religious terms. I'm working through a multi-pass revision strategy (Alignment, Context/Accuracy, Transliteration) to ensure a high-quality final product. I'm actively translating segment P443e, analyzing the source context.

Unpacking Brotherhood Link

I'm now diving into the implications of the brotherhood connection, specifically through Abd al-Rahman Abd al-Khaliq. I see how this link might be used to incite fear of future repercussions. I'm focusing on the potential impact on the Kuwaiti society, examining how this network is portrayed and the warnings being issued against boycotting Kuwait.

Analyzing New Content

I'm now focusing on a new piece of content (P445), examining its introduction. It praises Kuwait's neutral policy in contrast to some expats, and contrasts that with two dangerous sects. I'm carefully rendering the source, starting with the invocation to Allah and then the description of the sects, one pro-Iran, the other Qutbis, in the Kuwaiti context. My work on the source of the Fatawa continues, ensuring to keep the message clear.

Discerning the Sects

I'm now grappling with the identities of the "dangerous sects" and their perceived threat within the Kuwaiti context. The Muslim Brotherhood's influence, along with its offshoots, is clearly highlighted. I'm focusing on the contrast drawn between Kuwait's neutral policy and the potentially destabilizing presence of these groups, particularly expatriates. This comparison to Oman is crucial, highlighting Kuwait's commitment to non-interference.

Evaluating Sectarian Threats

I'm now zeroing in on the identities and actions of the second sect. They are actively interfering in Egypt and promoting revolution, with one member explicitly calling for Sisi's execution. Their dangerous influence extends to calls for a "Gulf Spring." I'm carefully translating and considering the implications of this group and its specific statements, ensuring accurate rendering of these inflammatory claims.

Examining the Summary

I'm translating the section about the "Gulf Spring" and the call for governmental overthrow, carefully conveying the inflammatory nature of the rhetoric. I've successfully rendered the speaker's demand to search the internet for specific phrases and names, ensuring the user can verify the claims. Now, I am in the midst of analyzing the summary of the danger, focused on the contradictions to the Quran and Sunnah, the disobedient nature of this discourse, and the risks of boycott that this implies.

Rendering the Recommendations

I'm now rendering the specific recommendations in P445c-h. The source begins with a call for sincere repentance from "false methodologies" and warns against those who persist in deviation. It then advocates for expelling those who corrupt Kuwaiti youth and for denouncing these acts. Finally, it stresses solidarity with the authorities.

Analyzing Reactions

I am now translating a response from the author, reaffirming that Abd al-Rahman Abd al-Khaliq follows the Muslim Brotherhood's methodology. I'm carefully rendering the geopolitical context, highlighting the contrasting stances of Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the UAE, and Bahrain against Iran, Turkey, and Qatar, and how Kuwait navigates this complex landscape.

Translating Geopolitical Context

I am currently translating the response, which restates Abd al-Rahman Abd al-Khaliq's adherence to the Muslim Brotherhood's methodology. I'm focusing on the geopolitical divisions within the region, specifically the contrasting stances of Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the UAE, and Bahrain versus Iran, Turkey, and Qatar. I'm analyzing the implications for Kuwait, particularly its potential alignment within this complex landscape and the specific religious and worldly considerations driving these affiliations.

Predicting the Future

I am now rendering the author's prediction of Kuwait's future role, considering the ongoing regional tensions, namely the pressure Kuwait might face to choose sides between opposing factions. I'm focusing on the implied threat of exposure for those involved in potentially destabilizing activities. The source suggests potential consequences for activists and organizations, a critical aspect of this translation. The implications for Kuwait's relationship with Saudi Arabia are becoming clearer.

Evaluating Final Statements

I'm now translating the final remarks in P445k, which offer supplication for guidance and protection from Iranian influence and related groups, ending with traditional salutations to the Prophet. Following this, I'm commencing the translation of P446, which is a message from Abd al-Aziz b. Khalil al-Sa'i defending Tariq al-Isa and demanding proof. I'm focusing on the context that Tariq's link to Abd al-Rahman Abd al-Khaliq is in question.

Translating Defense of al-Isa

I am now translating the defense from Abd al-Aziz b. Khalil al-Sa'i regarding Tariq al-Isa. I'm carefully rendering the initial salutations and the summarized phone messages received. My focus is on conveying the direct request for evidence and the implication that any accusations against al-Isa are based on conjecture. I'm focusing on the tone of urgency and emphasis on providing concrete proof, as well as the implied potential damage to al-Isa's reputation, and the potential consequence of not having proof.

Addressing the Demand

I'm now focusing on a response to the demand for proof regarding Tariq al-Isa's connection to Abd al-Rahman Abd al-Khaliq. The author, Abd al-Aziz b. Khalil al-Sa'i, begins with salutations and a humble plea to Allah for assistance. I'm focusing on the tone, which shifts towards firmness, and also emphasizing the request for substantial evidence with a "high chain of narration" within 24 hours. The source conveys urgency and a potential end to the discussion if the accusers fail to provide adequate proof. My work now is to ensure the message remains clear and precise, with all implications well rendered.

Addressing Accusations

I'm translating the author's response, now focused on the initial response, which expresses amazement at the accuser's style and questions the apparent lack of knowledge regarding Tariq al-Isa and Abd al-Rahman Abd al-Khaliq's long-standing agreement and shared methodology within the same organization. I'm carefully rendering the implicit challenge and emphasizing the perceived unity and harmony between the two figures, as well as their common goals. I am now beginning the translation of the second part of the response.

Formulating Questions

I'm now formulating questions that respond to the earlier requests for clarification. The initial response confirms an understanding that Abd al-Rahman Abd al-Khaliq has errors. It also requests specifics on those errors and the rationale for any differences. My focus is on ensuring a clear and precise translation that preserves the original intent, which seeks to clarify the nature of these supposed discrepancies and the reasoning behind them. The goal is to obtain details, or the lack thereof, regarding al-Isa's position in this matter.

Rendering a Reminder

I'm now translating a strong reminder from the author, highlighting a perceived unanswered question and a persistent lack of response. The author repeats the question, emphasizing a direct request for clarification regarding a potential disagreement between Tariq al-Isa and Abd al-Rahman Abd al-Khaliq. I am conveying the urgency and frustration in the message, as well as the implied potential consequences of failing to provide the requested information. This includes the offer to announce the answer and the author's eagerness to receive it.

Asserting a Challenge

I'm now translating the author's clear challenge, extending a year for clarification from Tariq al-Isa. I am rendering the direct inquiry on any disagreement between al-Isa and Abd al-Khaliq, and a reward for proof of divergence. Finally, I am now starting translation of the final part of this section.

Analyzing Continued Dialogue

My focus is now on the conclusion, which addresses the act of extending greetings versus endorsing ideological errors. I note a distinction between giving "salam" (a Muslim right) and approving "manhaj" (methodological) errors. I'm translating the author's statement, emphasizing that extending a greeting doesn't imply agreement with a person's ideas or methodologies, drawing on Sunni scholarly tradition. I'm now transitioning to an advisory statement emphasizing the importance of seeking truth impartially.

Clarifying Ideological Concerns

I'm now rendering the conclusion which emphasizes avoiding partisanship and its consequences, drawing from Quranic verses. I'm focusing on the warning about the greatest punishments from Allah, including rejoicing in disobedience. The section highlights the dangers of forming factions and disobeying Allah, drawing on scholarly interpretations. Finally, I'm translating a supplication for guidance and forgiveness.

Evaluating Meeting Request

I'm now translating a communication from Tariq al-Isa via a mediator, inviting Salim for a visit. The initial translation is complete, starting with the traditional invocations. I'm carefully rendering Salim's response, which expresses skepticism and a specific question about Tariq's stance on differences with Shaykh Abd al-Rahman, focusing on methodological alignment. My focus is conveying Salim's clear doubt regarding a potential ideological difference, which he previously noted.

Reflecting on Rejection

I'm now rendering the section where Salim recalls his past exclusion from a meeting with Tariq al-Isa and his group at the Ihya' al-Turath Society. He references a specific incident where he was denied entry, even though he was with prominent scholars like Rabee al-Madkhali. This denial, followed by his insistence on attending, which led to his eventual removal, highlights a past and personal challenge to the ideological differences. I’m focusing on conveying this rejection.

Examining the Rejection

I am now translating Salim's response, which contrasts the recent request for a visit with his past exclusion from a meeting with Tariq and his group. The exclusion, even when accompanied by esteemed scholars, raises doubts about a genuine ideological shift. The source references past communications where Salim pointed out criticisms and insults from Tariq's follower, N. Shams, including articles supporting extremist groups. The lack of response from Tariq deepens the skepticism, which drives the skepticism regarding the request.

Evaluating Unanswered Criticisms

I am now translating Salim's continuing response, which expresses his frustration regarding the unanswered critiques and insults. He recounts sending messages and photos detailing the insults and accusations from Tariq's follower, N. Shams, including extremist support. Salim highlights that Tariq ignored his communications, suggesting a deepening commitment to Abd al-Rahman Abd al-Khaliq, and a strong defense of the Muslim Brotherhood. This is now rendering in full.

I've finished translating Salim's response, rendering his frustration with Tariq al-Isa's continued support for Abd al-Rahman Abd al-Khaliq despite the unanswered criticisms. I've re-reviewed all segment IDs, and chosen the most appropriate English terms. I'm focusing on the implied ideological alignment and the implications within the text. Now, I am ready to begin a final revision for accuracy and fluency.

Clarifying Terminology Usage

I'm now thoroughly examining the specific terms used, especially those that have potential for multiple interpretations like "network" or phrases from Islamic legal discourse such as "Tabdi'" (declaring innovator), and "Sanad 'ali" (High chain). I am also paying close attention to nuances in rendering the names and terms, especially when they are outside the traditional "chain of narrators" which are usually associated with the ALA-LC transliteration. I've re-examined the source content regarding the usage and proper translation of common terms like "the Internet" to ensure consistency throughout the text.

Standardizing Name Transliteration

My focus has shifted to the names and transliterations within the text, and I've decided to establish a consistent approach for modern figures, favoring standard English spellings (Tariq al-Isa, Abd al-Rahman Abd al-Khaliq) and clean transliteration (Rabī' al-Madkhalī, Falāḥ Mandakār) for scholarly figures to maintain clarity while respecting scholarly style. I will also ensure "Allah" is used consistently for "God".

Revising for Fluency

I'm now in a final revision pass to ensure the translation is accurate and flows naturally in English. I'm focusing on ensuring consistency in terminology, particularly religious and legal terms. I have successfully rendered the proverb "kād al-murīb an yaqūl khudhūnī" as "The suspicious one is about to say: Take me". Also, I've rechecked segment IDs to prepare for final rendering, ensuring no markdown is present. I've re-examined the source content regarding the usage and proper translation of common terms like "the Internet" to ensure consistency throughout the text, including consistent capitalization of "Allah" and the use of the "Sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam" abbreviation after the name of the Prophet.

I need to translate Arabic text, making sure to strip out Arabic characters except for ﷺ. For narrators, I’ll use the ALA-LC transliteration system in chains only. The text includes references to hadith, which I’ll translate properly while avoiding Arabic characters and replacing "God" with "Allah" where necessary.

Handling Arabic text, numerals, and chapter references
I need to keep chapter headings and IDs intact, ensuring they maintain their original numbering. Arabic-Indic digits must be converted to Western numerals, so "١٤/" becomes "14/". Additionally, Qur'an references like "النساء/34" should be translated to "(al-Nisa' 4:34)" without including Arabic letters. I’ll take care to follow all these guidelines.

Handling names and references in hadith
For hadith references like "البقرة/228", I'll translate to "(al-Baqarah 2:228)" with Western numerals. Arabic-Indic digits like "٣٠٤" will become "304". Regarding names, I’ll transliterate narrators' names only when they appear in full chains, following the ALA-LC system. Outside of chains, I'll use standard English spellings without diacritics. No transliteration necessary for other names.

Translating names in hadith references
While the instruction suggests transliterating only the names of narrators in full isnad chains, mentioning a narrator like "from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri" could be treated like a chain. It seems safest to transliterate these names with diacritics, like "Abū Saʿīd al-Khuḍrī'', but I'll avoid transliterating non-narrator names, sticking to the guidelines.

Translating technical terms and narrator names
The instruction specifies transliterating only the names of narrators with ALA-LC diacritics, so I'll use "Abū Bakrah" and "Abū Saʿīd al-Khuḍrī" with diacritics. Non-narrator names and terms like 'aqidah or manhaj are technical and should be left in their transliterated form, as per the instruction on using correct terminology.

Handling transliteration and citations
Given the guidelines, I'll stick to using "aqidah" and "manhaj" without diacritics, as this keeps it simple and aligns with the instruction to avoid ALA-LC diacritics for textual content. For citations, I'll also cite the material inline in plain text and avoid altering special characters while adhering to the user's formatting preference.

Confirming missing file content
It seems like lines P514j, k, l, and P514m are missing or truncated. I will revisit the file using mclick to open additional lines and confirm if any content was cut off. If necessary, I'll search again for specific parts like "P514j -" to retrieve the earlier lines.

Finding missing lines in the file
It seems like the file might start at P514m, with no earlier lines included in the snippet. Although the initial preview showed P514j-k-l plus P514m, they could be from a different portion of the file. To locate P514j, I’ll try searching for "المدة إذا طالت" within the chunk and recheck.

Locating missing chunks and translation segments
I’ve got segments P514j through P517 and P515a through P515o, but I still need to locate missing parts like P514 and P515c, d. The translation request asks for all Arabic text in the file to be translated, so I’ll need to ensure I gather these missing pieces and cover everything. Time to search again.

Expanding segment P516
I’ve got P515i and a partial of P515a, but now I need the full P516, which is a long segment with hadith quotes. We already have part of it up to line 6, so I’ll expand it by clicking around the 2:1 pointer to get more lines and capture the rest. Let's try that.

Reading documents

Managing citations and formatting in translation
The mclick opened a large section with useful line numbers, so we’ll use this for citations (e.g., (website) following translation). Since the user doesn’t want formatting, I’ll keep IDs at the beginning and include citations at the end of each segment line. I'll ensure that no Arabic characters other than ﷺ and avoid Arabic quotes or letters in citations. Translating "620هـ" to "620 AH" as well.

Translation approach and instructions
The Arabic numerals from 19-24 will be translated as "nineteen" to "twenty-four." The user wants a literal translation, but idioms might need adjusting for clarity. We’ll translate across all segments from P514j to P517, up to the incomplete section starting with "First: that the presence of the recording...". We'll follow the user's instructions for revisions and avoid bullet points, but enumerations and chapter headings will stay as "Ninth:", "Tenth:", etc.

Translation of phrases and verses
The phrase "والله المستعان" will be translated as "And Allah is the One sought for help." In P514j, “اعلموا أن المدة إذا طالت…” translates to discussing timing. The Qur'an verses to translate include al-Mujadilah 58:6, al-Isra' 17:36, al-Kahf 18:49, and al-Qamar 54:53. Proper citations will be included for clarity. Additionally, P515 mentions a statement about people not identifying with the Muslim Brotherhood.

Translating phrases and context
The term "الإخوان المسلمين" translates to "the Muslim Brotherhood", which I’ll keep in parentheses. For P515a, the translation of "Shari'ah" can stay as is, though I’ll avoid using ALA-LC. "يحكمون بما أنزل الله" becomes "rule by what Allah has revealed." Other phrases like "martyred Muslims" and "mujāhidūn" will also be translated carefully.

Translating and clarifying details
For P515f, the text refers to the idea that lacking sympathy means opposing Islam, which is inculcated. Moving on to P515g, it discusses people following Ikhwan ideology without being directly involved in the organization. I'll list names without diacritics and ensure consistent transliterations like Abdulrahman Abdulkhaliq, Hakim al-Mutayri, and others. P515i and onwards detail the rejection of affiliations for political reasons, such as after Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait.

Translating perspectives on women in judiciary roles
P515n discusses loyalty to specific parties, emphasizing alignment with either the General Guide or Supreme Guide. P515o praises this notion. P516 addresses women becoming judges, referencing historical and scholarly opinions, the Quran, and Hadith to argue for male leadership in such roles. I’ll translate with respect for context and details like ﷺ for the Prophet.

Translating discussion on women and public authority in Islam
He argues that since a woman’s testimony is considered half of a man’s, she cannot be a judge. Referencing various scholars, he notes the Shari'ah’s preference for men in roles like inheritance and judgments. He stresses that the Prophet ﷺ and caliphs never appointed women as judges, and it’s an established Ummah consensus.

Translating thoughts on women in leadership and education
The Shaykh says a key condition for a leader is that they be male—this has no scholarly dispute. He argues women aren’t fit for public roles like judges, citing history and the practice of men assuming leadership roles. The author advises women to avoid such positions. Then, he reflects on a situation involving a teacher at Kuwait University, influencing students with revolutionary ideas and how this impacts young minds.

Reflecting on accountability in teaching
It’s concerning that individuals with a history of disruptive actions, like storming the National Assembly, are allowed to teach. Shouldn't there be official recordings of all lectures for both security and educational reasons? This would help ensure that neither professors nor students deviate from course material or bring inappropriate ideas into the classroom, safeguarding both educational integrity and discipline.

Transliterating and translating book titles and phrases
For terms like "إرواء الغليل", I will transliterate them into Latin letters as "Irwa' al-Ghalil" (without diacritics). Book titles such as "Adwa' al-Bayan", "Sharh al-Sunnah", and others will follow the same approach. Additionally, I'll translate terms like "المرشد العام" as "the General Guide" and "السرورية" as "the Sururiyyah" while keeping consistency in transliteration. For phrases like "سبحان الله تطابقة!!" I'll translate as "Subhan Allah, they were identical!!"

Deciding on translation and transliteration for consistency
I’ll focus on translating phrases like Qur'anic verses and du'a, while using transliteration for names and technical terms where required. For example, the phrase "صلى الله عليه وسلم" will include "ﷺ" as directed, but I’ll check context to ensure consistency. Book titles and references will be translated and properly cited, without using Arabic script. The goal is clear: keep translations accurate while maintaining clarity and consistency in transliteration where necessary.

Starting translation while maintaining clarity
For the Arabic phrases, I’ll avoid interpreting any verse as a direct quote in Arabic but will translate the meanings carefully. I’ll use "Allah, Exalted is He" along with verse references. In the text, I’ll focus on maintaining the essence of the message, like translating the salawat properly with ﷺ and ensuring clarity in each segment. I'll also avoid markdown and maintain consistency throughout.

Analyzing and preparing translation of texts
I’m reflecting on a lot here, especially regarding the testimony of women, with references to both the Qur’an and Hadith. For the translation, I’ll make sure to capture certain concepts with accuracy, like the notion of "deficiency in intellect and religion," without introducing restatements. Some elements, like the phrases relating to Shaytan's temptations, should be carefully worded so they sound literal yet understandable. I'll avoid including Arabic bracket text and ensure the translation is clear.

I'm currently focused on the analytical aspect. I'm carefully examining the source material, Salim al-Tawil's Fatawa, to determine the necessary translation considerations. My aim is to define the ideal approach for an accurate and relevant translation, with sensitivity to the original content. I want to make sure I grasp the key aspects of the original before I begin the translation.

Implementing the Translation

I've moved into the practical translation phase. My methodology prioritizes accuracy, favoring a literal approach unless the context necessitates a meaning-based translation. I'm being meticulous with Islamic terminology, paying close attention to words like Aqeedah and Manhaj. I'm also carefully handling the formatting: preserving narration chains, using ALA-LC for narrator names, rendering "God" as "Allah", and adhering to plain text. I'm currently working on P521f. I am paying close attention to maintaining the integrity of the source text, which is the hadith by Abu Talha. I will revise the translation three times.

Examining Nuances in Detail

I'm now focusing on a specific section, P521g, delving into the nuances of neighborly harm. I'm carefully analyzing the Arabic text and its implications. I am trying to translate this and I have already translated the section P521g. I'm working to capture the essence of the original, including the implications for the implications of harming neighbors. I am working to translate the concepts of a major sin (in this context, harming neighbors). This will need several revisions to be perfect.

Clarifying the Text

I'm now in the process of translating P521h. I'm focusing on the concepts of ownership and exchange related to dogs. I'm carefully examining the prohibition on selling dogs, referencing the relevant hadith. I'm aiming to provide a clear and precise translation of this portion. I want to convey the distinction between owning a dog and the commercial aspects of dog ownership.

Exploring Supporting Hadith

I'm now diving into the supporting hadith concerning the prohibition of dog sales, focusing specifically on P521i and P521j. I'm carefully translating and cross-referencing the narrations from al-Bukhārī, Muslim, and Abu Dawud to ensure accuracy. My current focus is on capturing the nuances of the prohibition on receiving payment for dogs, which may have cultural or historic differences.

Interpreting Supporting Evidence

I'm now wrestling with the hadith from Abu Dawud (3021) and the interpretations from al-Hafiz, al-Albani, and al-Nawawi. The emphasis on the "evil earning" and the action of filling a palm with dust is something I'm unpacking, exploring how it emphasizes the absolute prohibition of the dog sale. I'm carefully contrasting the explicit prohibition with the nuanced explanations from the scholars, ensuring the translation conveys this.

Connecting Scholarly Consensus

I'm synthesizing the consensus among various scholars regarding the prohibition of dog sales. I am carefully examining the evidence presented, focusing on the views of Abū Hurayrah, al-Ḥasan al-Baṣrī, al-Shāfi'ī, and others. I'm noting the definitive stance against dog sales, irrespective of the dog's purpose or training. I am trying to translate the evidence as presented in the source text. I am also making sure to preserve the exact wording and quotes by the scholars.

Translating the Nuance

I'm now grappling with the ethical implications of dog ownership, specifically the reputation damage it can cause. I'm carefully translating the phrase "dog breeder" and its negative connotation, along with the implications for family reputation. I'm focusing on the rhetorical question "Is it permissible to befriend a dog?" in the context of Islamic ethics. This requires a nuanced understanding of cultural perceptions and religious viewpoints. I've translated the closing and I am now moving on to the opening.

Beginning a New Section

I'm starting a new section, P522a, and am focusing on the introduction. I'm translating the Arabic text, and it's about people's treatment of rulers. I need to convey both the harsh criticism and the extreme obedience, which are presented. I'm trying to translate the nuances of the text and clarify the correct stance as explained by the scholars.

Defining Extremism's Spectrum

I'm now focusing on the introduction of P522b and the delicate balance it describes. The recent update is about those who have extremist views. I'm carefully translating the contrasting views, from harsh criticism to extreme obedience. It's difficult to translate the specific tweet about Muhammad, but I'm trying to convey the overall sentiment, and the need to follow the proper stance of the scholars.

Dissecting a Dissent

I'm presently translating the critique of the speaker's words. I'm carefully rendering the distinction between the speaker's prayer for MbZ and the lack of a similar phrase for the Prophet ﷺ. My focus is on the emphasis of the Messenger's unique status and the necessary love for the Prophet, which should exceed love for oneself or family. I'm grappling with the delicate wording to convey the implied criticism effectively, reflecting the nuanced discussion.

Analyzing Complex Claims

I'm now translating the response to the claim that the Prophet ﷺ is a terrorist role model, in P522c. The source material is quite passionate, and I'm carefully rendering the strong denial of this accusation. I'm focusing on highlighting the Prophet's ﷺ role as a mercy to all worlds, which is a key element of the text. It's crucial to convey the refutation of the false accusations.

Analyzing Terminology in Context

Now, I'm focusing on the term "terrorism" and its meaning within the text. I'm carefully translating the clarification of "Irhab" as used in Quran 8:60. I want to ensure the translation accurately conveys the concept of striking fear into the enemies of Allah, and how it aligns with the broader context of the source. This demands careful attention to how the author distinguishes between this term and the modern usage of "terrorism."

Distinguishing True from False

The current focus is on the nuances of the term "terrorism" within the text. I'm exploring the context of Quran 8:60 and clarifying that true "terrorism" involves instilling fear in the enemies of Allah, a concept exemplified by the Prophet's ﷺ military campaigns against disbelievers and hypocrites. I'm carefully translating the author's argument, emphasizing the Prophet's ﷺ striving and comparing the actions against the Kharijites. I'm emphasizing the Prophet's ﷺ innocence from Kharijites.

Rebutting False Claims

My current concern is to refute the claim that the Prophet ﷺ is a role model for terrorists. I'm focusing on the refutation that his actions are for fighting, shedding blood without the right to do so. I'm carefully translating the author's argument that the Messenger ﷺ is innocent of those who shed blood among Muslims. I'm trying to translate the author's analogy between the Kharijites' claim and the claims of the Jews and Christians.

Discerning Emulation and Leadership

I'm now translating the final part of this section. I'm focusing on the refutation of the comparison between the Prophet ﷺ and MbZ, highlighting MbZ's own humility. I'm carefully translating the author's argument that no one can be compared to the Prophet, and MbZ's name Muhammad reflects his respect for the Prophet. The final aim is to convey the emphatic statement that a true Muslim cannot deny the Prophet as his role model.

Emphasizing the Prophet's ﷺ Station

I'm now focusing on a strong statement about the Messenger's ﷺ unique position. I'm carefully translating the author's rejection of any comparison, even with the rightly guided caliphs, or with prophets like Nūḥ, Ibrāhīm, Mūsá, and 'Īsá. I'm highlighting that the Messenger ﷺ is the Master of the Children of Adam and the Seal of the Prophets. I'm aiming to convey the emphatic conclusion: No Muslim could deny him as their role model, and the text I translated reinforces the unparalleled status of the Prophet ﷺ.

Asserting Prophet's ﷺ Leadership

I'm now translating the final section, P522f. I'm focusing on the bold declaration that a Muslim cannot disassociate from following the Prophet ﷺ. The text describes this action as "Khudhlan," a form of abandonment. I'm carefully translating Ibn al-Qayyim's quote to highlight the profound debt owed to the Prophet ﷺ, emphasizing that constant prayer cannot fulfill it. This part underscores the paramount importance of emulating the Messenger of Allah ﷺ.

Translating the Degradation

I'm now grappling with the statement that comparing the Prophet ﷺ to others is a diminution of his status. This thought goes beyond the earlier section. I'm carefully rendering the poetic comparison, "The sword is diminished if told it is sharper than a stick," emphasizing its seriousness. I'm focusing on the potential for "Major Kufr" and recognizing the insult embedded within this comparison. I also translated the part about the rulers.

Translating the Degradation

I'm now grappling with the statement that comparing the Prophet ﷺ to others is a diminution of his status. This thought goes beyond the earlier section. I'm carefully rendering the poetic comparison, "The sword is diminished if told it is sharper than a stick," emphasizing its seriousness. I'm focusing on the potential for "Major Kufr" and recognizing the insult embedded within this comparison. I also translated the part about the rulers.

Refuting Extremist Claims

I'm now deeply immersed in the severe criticisms and extremist views regarding rulers. I'm carefully translating the author's strong condemnation of comparing the Prophet ﷺ to others, labeling such statements as potentially leading to "Major Kufr." I'm also capturing the stark contrast between the Islamic approach to leadership, emphasizing reasonable obedience, sincere advice, and the avoidance of publicizing faults or inciting rebellion. I'm focusing on the refutation of the comparison between the Prophet ﷺ and rulers, especially those who may lead to Jahannam.

Clarifying Extremist Views

I'm now confronting the extremist view expressed in the text. I am carefully translating the strong condemnation of comparing the Prophet to others, noting it could lead to Kufr. I am capturing the stark contrast between the Islamic approach to leadership, emphasizing reasonable obedience, sincere advice, and the avoidance of publicizing faults or inciting rebellion. I am translating the quote from the common man regarding following rulers into Hell, rejecting this.

Analyzing Extremist Ideologies

I am now focusing on the text from P522h, where the author strongly condemns comparing the Prophet to rulers, suggesting it could lead to Kufr. I'm translating the shocking quote about following rulers to Hell, repudiating this extreme view. The author then moves into P522i by praying for Allah’s peace and blessing, which I have translated, as well as the opening of P523.

Justifying Silence

I'm now translating the responses to the questions about silence. I'm focusing on the author's refutation of accusations of slander and insults. The author highlights the absurdity of such questions when he hasn't been engaged in such activity. I'm carefully translating the emphasis on not engaging in any form of defamation or abuse, and the author's astonishment at the accusations.

Translating the Condemnation

I'm translating the section about avoiding insults. I'm focusing on the refutation of the accusations of slander. The author highlights the strangeness of being questioned about why he doesn't insult anyone, given the clear prohibition in the hadith. I'm focusing on the Prophet's ﷺ statement about the sinfulness of abusing a Muslim. I'm also including the hadith about a believer not being an obscene person.

Analyzing Recent Arguments

I'm now deep into translating the author's arguments concerning the criticism of the UAE and other nations. The emphasis is on refuting accusations and clarifying political motivations behind such attacks, especially those stemming from Ikhwan ideology. I'm focusing on the author's nuanced approach, which advocates against general government bashing. This involves a careful rendering of the political and methodological differences, and the accusations of those that hate the UAE. I've worked through the translation to convey the author's strong rebuttal.

Analyzing Modern Criticisms

I'm presently translating the author's nuanced response to accusations of government bashing. I'm carefully translating the Ikhwani ideology's political motivations, which advocate against such criticism. The emphasis is on refuting accusations and clarifying the author's viewpoint, which is to stay away from general attacks. I'm also addressing the current social climate where silence is interpreted as selling out, with political and personal motivations.

Rebutting the Justifications

I'm now focusing on the author's argument against the justification of insulting others. I'm carefully translating the quote from Quran 6:108. I'm translating how the author uses it to show the prohibition on insults, even towards disbelievers. I am examining his analogy. I'm also translating the author's rhetorical questions challenging those who endorse insults and the focus on the UAE's political decision. I have translated through to the beginning of P524b.

Dissecting Political Motivations

I'm translating the author's analysis of why the UAE is singled out for criticism, which focuses on historical ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. The translation must reflect their previous support from the UAE, their current resentment, and the author's explanation of Ikhwani tactics. This section requires great sensitivity to political subtleties, particularly concerning the Ikhwan's methodology.

Examining Political Enmity

I'm now clarifying the author's dissection of political motivations behind criticism of the UAE. I'm focusing on the historical animosity between the Emirates and the Muslim Brotherhood. The translation must clearly articulate the Brotherhood's resentment towards the UAE's restrictions and the author's conclusion regarding the critics' affiliations. I've translated through to the beginning of the next paragraph.

Clarifying Political Allegiances

I'm now clarifying the author's argument, showing the unfair accusations against the Emirates, including traitor labels. I'm carefully translating the dismissal of these claims and comparing the UAE to other modern countries. I'm focusing on the author's view that these nations follow self-interested policies. I am translating the quote from the source text and also conveying the historical ties and their current support.

Reiterating the Prohibition

I've translated the author's strong stance against personal attacks on rulers, governments, or citizens. The author emphasizes that these individuals should not speak against any governments. The author argues that today's enmity could be tomorrow's cooperation, leaving the people as losers to the resulting rancor. This is my perspective as an individual.

Analyzing Justification and Nuance

I'm now focusing on the author's argument against the justification of insulting others, particularly the UAE. I'm translating the quote from the Quran about not insulting other deities and how the author uses it to show the prohibition on insults. I am translating his use of rhetorical questions, addressing those who support insults, and exploring the motivation behind these insults, specifically in the context of the UAE's political decisions. I've translated through to the start of P524c.

Defining Technical Terminology

I'm presently translating the complex term "ḥulwān" (sweetener). After considering "gift," "payment," and "earnings," I've decided to use "sweetener" for this hadith. It's closest to the original meaning and captures the nuance of an illicit gain. This decision aligns with the instructions, ensuring the translation is both accurate and contextually sound.

Analyzing Complex Nuances

I'm presently translating the author's nuanced definition of "ḥulwān". After reviewing potential translations like "gift", "payment" or "sweetener", I will use "bribe", which captures the illicit gain. I'm prioritizing accuracy, and "bribe" is closer to the original concept and context. I am also making sure I am making my own judgements.

I need to translate Arabic into English, ensuring no Arabic characters other than ﷺ appear. I'll use ALA-LC for names of narrators but not for textual content. There are no hadith chains here, primarily names like "أحمد الخليلي" and "يوسف القرضاوي," which I may transliterate based on context.

Deciding on transliteration style
Okay, for names not in the chain, I think I should use standard English transliterations like "Ahmad al-Khalili" without diacritics. The user's instructions are clear: ALA-LC only for narrators in the chain. Diacritics aren't banned but shouldn’t be used unless it’s for those specific names in the chain.

Translating while following guidelines
I think I’ve got it: for names not part of a chain (like "Ahmad al-Khalili"), I should use their common English forms without diacritics. ALA-LC with macrons applies only to narrators in chains. For technical terms, I’ll use translations, like "imamate" for "إمامته" and "legal ḥadd punishment" for "حد شرعي."

Translating technical terms with diacritics
For terms like "ḥadd" and "Ahl al-ḥall wa’l-ʿaqd," I'll use transliteration with diacritics since they're technical Arabic terms. While ALA-LC is for narrators in chains, these seem like exceptions. I might try translating the latter as "those with authority to appoint and depose," though.

Translating and maintaining proper terminology
To follow the instructions, I'll translate Arabic technical terms like "ʿaqīdah" as "creed" where appropriate, but I can also use "ʿaqīdah" with a note for clarity if necessary. Names like "Khawarij" and "Ibadiyya" will be kept transliterated or translated based on context. I'll avoid ALA-LC except for narrator names and translate Quran verses, including sura names in standard English.

Translating Quranic terms and maintaining accuracy
I’ll use common English spellings for names like "al-Baqarah" and "al-Anbiya" without diacritics, following the instructions. For Quranic quotes, I'll translate everything into English, including verse content and surah names. I'll also avoid any Arabic letters and translate phrases like "صلى الله عليه وسلم" appropriately as " ﷺ."

Translating key phrases carefully
For phrases like "صلى الله وسلم وبارك," I’ll translate as "and may Allah send prayers, peace, and blessings upon our Prophet Muhammad ﷺ." For terms like "إمامته" or "جماعة المسلمين", I’ll use "imamate" and "the body of Muslims." I'll carefully translate phrases like "ilhad" as "atheism" in certain contexts, and "deviation" in others for accuracy.

Translating Quranic verses accurately
I need to translate verses clearly: For example, in Surah al-Baqarah (2:34), I’ll say “They prostrated except Iblis, who refused and was arrogant.” Also, for Taghut, I’ll keep it as "Taghut" unless I need to clarify the term. I'll ensure I don't duplicate similar verses, and maintain the original context.

Translating Quranic verses and transliterating titles
For Surah al-Hashr (59:7), "Take what the Messenger gives you, and refrain from what He forbids, and fear Allah." Similarly, in Surah Fussilat (41:40), I’ll translate "ilhad" considering context. I’m also using transliteration for book titles like Sharh Ghayat al-Murad fi Nazm al-I'tiqad, as Arabic letters are not allowed.

Translating and deciding on terminology
For the book title, I’ll use transliteration with a translation in parentheses, like Sharh Ghayat al-Murad fi Nazm al-I'tiqad (Explanation of the Ultimate Aim in the Poem on Creed). The phrase "qa'adi" I’ll keep as "quietist Kharijite" to clarify context. "Ikhwani" will likely be translated as "Brotherhood-aligned" to clarify its meaning.

Final translation adjustments and decisions
For the translation, I’ll keep "Imamate" as is but clarify with "his position as imam" for context. Translating "aqdhf" as "accusing chaste women of zina" seems good. For "ahl al-hall wa’l-‘aqd", I’ll use "those with authority to appoint and depose" to avoid ALA-LC formalities. I’ll also address line breaks and ensure pure text formatting.

Translating and refining segment details
I’m sticking with an apostrophe in transliteration for terms like "ahl al-hall wa'l-aqd" and avoiding ALA-LC by omitting diacritics. For "Jabal Nafusah" and "Al Jazeera," simple transliteration works. I'll be careful with phrases around freedom and revolution in the context of al-Khalili’s views. I’ll carry the translation and context through.

Translating key theological excerpts
The text emphasizes that Iblis, despite affirming Allah’s existence and attributes, remains a disbeliever due to arrogance and refusal to worship. The foundational point is that belief alone, without worship and avoiding shirk, does not grant salvation. Worship must align with the Sunnah of the Prophet to be valid.

Clarifying translation process and terminology
For clarity, I need to translate and explain the terms carefully while maintaining the technical accuracy. I'll use "tawhid" as a transliterated term since it's important. I'll ensure consistency with verse references and handle the special Arabic character marks (like "34»") appropriately, keeping the original context intact. Also, I'll use ﷺ after mentions of Muhammad.
