Translating and formatting Arabic text correctly
For the Arabic text translation, I’ll make sure to keep the segment IDs like P70b. Only transliterate names of narrators in the chain using ALA-LC, with no need to modify non-narrator names. I won’t touch textual content except for these names. This means keeping ﷺ and respecting citation formatting.

Deciding on transliteration for non-narrators
It seems that I only need to apply ALA-LC transliteration to the names of narrators in the chain, not to general content. For non-narrator names, I'll use English equivalents without diacritics. The goal is to prevent unnecessarily transliterating the entire text—just stick to the narrators' names.

Translating names and handling transliteration
Since there’s no chain in this case, I’ll simplify by using common English spellings without diacritics for non-narrator names (e.g., "al-Dhahabi"). For narrators in an isnad, I'll strictly follow ALA-LC with diacritics. The instruction suggests avoiding diacritics unless they're part of a chain of narration.

Translating and formatting text as required
For translation, I'll keep titles like "Shaykh al-Islam" in their original form. "Allah" will be used for God, and specific terms like "ilah" will be translated carefully. I'll handle Quran verses properly, with Segmentation IDs included as instructed. Citations will be added in the necessary format.

Translating technical terms and preserving formatting
For this task, I’ll maintain plain text without the use of any markdown, avoiding all uppercase headings as requested. When translating terms like "تنبيه" and "الروافض", I'll keep “Rāfiḍah” for clarity, including the necessary diacritics. Technical terms like "manhaj" and "bid'ah" will be transliterated, but I’ll avoid Arabic script entirely. I’ll ensure proper treatment of footnotes and ellipses too, while carefully preserving the required translation guidelines.

Translating segment by segment
I’m going to translate each segment carefully, ensuring it corresponds exactly. First, for P70b, I’ll start with the Shaykh's quote about not excusing the Rāfiḍah, pointing out their kufr. Then, I'll translate his description of someone raised in a biased environment, mentioning the importance of fairness, insight, and asking for forgiveness. The Quranic verse will be included too.

Translating terms and quotes accurately
I’ll translate terms like “bughat” as "rebellious group," “الخوارج المارقين” as "the renegade Khawarij," and “كلاب النار” as "the dogs of the Fire." For clarity, I’ll also translate quotes like "may Allah be pleased with them" for the companions and handle the Prophet's name as "Muḥammad ﷺ." I'll follow user instructions but keep some flexibility, like translating “the Prophet ﷺ” rather than transliterating religious phrases.

Translating central concepts with care
I’ll use "Muhammad ﷺ" without diacritics to avoid confusion, as it’s not part of the isnad chain. Translating the text includes explaining the severe takfir of figures like Abu Bakr, ‘Umar, and others. I'll follow user instructions while highlighting their opposition to Ahl al-Sunnah and their dangerous views about jihad and alliances.

Clarifying takfir conditions
The discussion involves two main opinions about declaring someone a disbeliever, specifically towards groups like the Khawarij, the Rāfiḍah, and others. The key point is about not declaring someone a kāfir without fulfilling conditions and presenting clear evidence—only then can they be judged accordingly, in line with Islamic principles on takfir.

Clarifying takfir rulings for specific individuals
The key distinction here is in judgment: while scholars can declare certain actions as kufr, they typically do not declare an individual kāfir until they've clarified the issue with them and given them a chance to repent. This is especially true when dealing with misunderstandings or mistakes, as seen in historical examples.

Transliteration and punctuation choices
When translating, I’m staying cautious about transliteration. For names in the chain of narration, following ALA-LC is key, as it ensures accuracy, but for general names like Ibn Taymiyyah, ALA-LC is also acceptable, unless explicitly restricted. I’ll stick with ASCII digits and respect the clarity of punctuation, avoiding Arabic characters entirely.

Maintaining consistency with transliteration and abbreviations
For transliteration, I'll stick with ALA-LC for proper names and terms, and use diacritics for accuracy, like "Rabīʿ al-Madkhalī" and "Aḥmad ibn Ḥanbal." I'll ensure no Arabic script remains, and I’ll use "Allah" instead of "God" where appropriate. Citations will be added clearly, and punctuation will follow standard formatting.

Clarifying translation and transliteration rules
Alright, so it looks like I need to only transliterate the narrators' names using ALA-LC, not the textual content itself. As for the term "God," it should be translated as "Allah" unless it's referring to a specific ilāh. Oh, and I must remember to keep numeric prefixes unchanged.

Understanding transliteration versus translation guidelines
Alright, I need to use ALA-LC transliteration only for the narrators' names in the chains but not for the textual content. It seems like non-narrator names should likely be translated into plain English instead of being transliterated. I’ll need to stick to these guidelines for accuracy.

Clarifying transliteration guidelines for Islamic terminology
It seems that I need to only use ALA-LC transliteration for narrators' names in the chains, while translating other names into regular English. Arabic diacritics (except ﷺ) shouldn't appear, so I’ll avoid using them. No chains means I should just use common English transliteration for names instead of ALA-LC for non-chain names.

Handling transliteration and common translations
The user wants ALA-LC transliteration only for narrators' names, so non-narrator names should be in common English transliteration. For Arabic phrases like حفظه الله and رحمه الله, I should translate them as “may Allah preserve him” or “may Allah have mercy on him.” I'll also use ﷺ for صلى الله عليه وسلم.

I need to translate the Arabic into English, making sure I only apply the ALA-LC transliteration to names of narrators in chains. There are no chains here, but scholarly names like Sheikh Rabi’ al-Madkhali should have transliteration. I'll preserve terms like "jarh wa ta'dil," "manhaj," and "bida’" as requested. And use "Allah" for God, and ﷺ for صلى الله عليه وسلم.

Clarifying Arabic character usage and transliteration
The developer specified there should be no Arabic characters except for one, and I think that refers to ﷺ. I’ll include this as Arabic. Also, the user wants ALA-LC transliteration for names of narrators in chains, but not for textual content. Since there are no chains here, I don’t need to apply transliteration to the scholars’ names like Ibn Taymiyya, etc.

Deciding on transliteration and terminology use
The user asked to preserve full narration chains and apply ALA-LC transliteration to narrators' names, but since there are no chains here, I don’t need to apply ALA-LC. Instead, I'll translate names (like Ibn Taymiyya) into standard English forms. I’ll also translate key technical terms like "jarh wa ta’dil" but keep terms like "manhaj" in transliteration.

Translating terms while respecting context and transliteration
The user prefers literal translations, but with context-based adjustments. So, "jarh wa ta'dil" should be translated as "criticism and validation of narrators," "manhaj" as "methodology," "bida'" as "innovation," and "'aqeedah" as "creed." I’ll also use common English forms for scholars' names (e.g., Ibn Taymiyya). Meanwhile, I'll use "Allah" for "God" and "ﷺ" for Prophet.

The user didn't request transliteration for names except for narrators, so for names like الشيخ ربيع, I'll use "Shaykh Rabīʿ" in ALA-LC format. For general names, I'll use English translations. I'll follow the user’s other rules, like using "Allah" for "God" and translating Quranic text as needed.

Translating verses content and technical terms
I need to translate the Quranic content into English, avoiding Arabic characters, but still include transliterations like (Fatir: 43), which seems to be the user's preferred format. I'll also use the correct transliteration for technical terms like "jarh wa ta'dil," "taqlīd," and "manhaj," following the user's guidelines.

Translating with accuracy and preserving technical terms
The user's request is clear: prioritize literal translations but with context for accuracy. For terms like "jarh wa ta'dil," I should use "narrator-criticism and -accreditation." I'll translate technical terms like "manhaj," "bida’," and "'aqeedah" while ensuring I use formal titles like "His Eminence the Mufti" and include citations, e.g., (Fatir: 43).

Translating Arabic text and Quranic references with accuracy
Translating and verifying Quranic verses
For the verse "But the evil plot encompasses none but its own people," I'll translate it as: "And evil plotting only backfires upon those who plot it." That seems okay. For Yunus:58, the translation is: "Say, 'In the bounty of Allah and in His mercy - in that let them rejoice; that is better than what they accumulate.'" I’ll verify that now.

I’m thinking about how to handle Rabīʿ and "المفتي" (al-Muftī). Since this is a title, I don’t need to transliterate it; only the narrators’ names in chains should be in ALA-LC. But there’s no chain for these names, so I might leave Arabic names in Arabic script, like they said.

Resolving transliteration conflict
The user mentioned no Arabic characters except for ﷺ. So, I need to transliterate names using Latin characters. They also said ALA-LC is only for narrators in chains, but didn't forbid it elsewhere. To stay safe, I’ll use ALA-LC for all names, ensuring no Arabic characters.

Clarifying transliteration and translation rules
To meet the user's request, I’ll avoid Arabic characters except for ﷺ. I’ll transliterate names using ALA-LC, like Shaykh Rabīʿ and Muftī, and translate terms like “bida’” into “innovation.” I’ll also use “Allah” for God and apply the requested translation and salutation rules. A final check will ensure everything is consistent.

Clarifying transliteration and translation guidelines
I need to avoid using Arabic characters except for ﷺ, so I’ll stick with translating technical terms like "bida’" as “innovation in the religion” and "‘aqeedah" as “creed.” I'll follow ALA-LC transliteration for all names and consider converting titles to English when appropriate. After that, I’ll go through a final revision pass and give a clean output.

Translating and transliterating as per user's specifications
Only ﷺ is allowed in Arabic script. For names, I’ll follow ALA-LC’s transliteration — e.g., Muḥammad ibn ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz ibn Mānʿ. Titles like "al-Muftī" stay in their English form. For technical terms, I'll translate concepts like 'manhaj' to "methodology" and 'maqṣid' to "creed," maintaining user preferences.

Alright, the user's instructions are clear: translate Islamic content precisely, use ALA-LC transliteration only for narrators' names in chains, and avoid using Arabic characters except when referring to ﷺ. For ‘God’, I’ll make sure to use 'Allah' unless it refers specifically to an ‘ilāh’. Keeping material ID references, like P26, is important too.

Finalizing translation guidelines
Okay, the plan here is clear: I'll perform three revision passes to ensure accuracy and avoid markdown, sticking to plain text. Arabic characters should only appear for ﷺ. I'll use correct Islamic terminology like jarh wa taʿdīl, manhaj, bidʿah, and ʿaqīdah with transliteration. I don’t need to worry about chains of narration here since they aren't present. I'll also translate chapter headings, poetry, and verses—if those appear.

Handling honorifics and translations
For "سماحة الشيخ," I’ll use "His Eminence Shaykh..." since the user didn’t specify further preferences for honorifics. For "رحمه الله," I’ll go with "may Allah have mercy on him" in parentheses, as it seems they expect this level of specialization. I'll also use "ﷺ" for the Prophet and handle the final phrase "ولله الحمد والمنة" accordingly.

Ensuring high-quality translation with revisions
The plan is clear: I’ll perform three revision passes to fine-tune this, ensuring accuracy and alignment, as instructed. I'll start by translating, keeping the numeric markers (like P26), translating Arabic quotes in each paragraph, and maintaining rhetorical questions. For the phrase, I’ll stick with the literal "Let him be ashamed" but aim for natural flow while preserving meaning.

Clarifying translation choices
For "أضف إلى ذلك," I'll translate it as "add to that." For "رسالة من سماحته؛ لها مكانتها في النفوس," it's "the letter from His Eminence has its place in people's hearts." As for names, I'll follow the instructions: use ALA-LC transliteration only for narrators’ names in the chain, and for others, I'll use common English renderings like "Ibn Baz" and "Shaykh Rabīʿ."

I need to translate the Arabic text to English, preserving the narration and applying ALA-LC transliteration only on the names of narrators. The specific names mentioned will be transliterated, and I’ll make sure to leave the textual content and religious terms like “God” and “صلى الله عليه وسلم” appropriately handled.

Ensuring accurate translation and proper formatting
I need to preserve "صلى الله عليه وسلم" as ﷺ and apply ALA-LC transliteration only to narrators' names. While there's no chain of narration here, I’ll follow the rule for transliterations carefully. I'll also do three internal passes as instructed: checking numeric markers, accuracy, and proper transliterations.

Translating Islamic terminology with precision
I need to translate specific Islamic terms accurately. For phrases like "jarh wa ta'dil," I'll use the transliteration "jarh wa taʿdīl" with a brief explanation in parentheses while maintaining the literal translations. For terms like 'aqīdah, manhaj, and bid'ah, I’ll follow the correct usage as instructed.

Translating with care and consistency
I’ll follow the guidelines closely: transliterate technical Arabic terms when necessary and provide translations in parentheses, use "Allah" instead of "God", and translate صلى الله عليه وسلم as ﷺ. I’ll apply ALA-LC for narrators’ names only, and avoid Arabic characters, except for ﷺ as instructed.

The user wants Arabic to English translation, keeping the IDs intact (like P122, P122a, etc.). I need to ensure there are no Arabic characters except ﷺ. For the names of narrators (like الشيخ عليّ, ربيع), I’ll use ALA-LC transliteration but leave other non-narrator names in common English forms if necessary, sticking to diacritics.

Translating scholarly names while preserving instructions
I’m wondering if I should transliterate scholarly names like "Shaykh ʿAlī" using ALA-LC, even if they’re not narrators in a chain. The instructions say to use ALA-LC only for narrators, but it doesn’t prohibit transliteration elsewhere. For consistency, it might be okay, but I’ll be mindful.

Translating names and terms for maximum accuracy
I think I should transliterate narrators in chains and use standard transliterations for other names. For terms like "ahl al-bidaʿ," I'll translate them as "people of innovation" or "innovators," depending on context. Terms like "manhaj" should remain as is, and I should consider parentheses for literal translations.

Translating terms to balance accuracy and clarity
For "hajr," I’ll use "hajr (shunning)" the first time, then just "hajr" after. I'll stick to the literal translation for most terms, but for clarity, the user is okay with established English terms like "boycotting/shunning" in certain contexts. I'll also ensure to translate and include references for Qur'an verses, keeping it all in plain text.

Translating carefully while preserving meaning
We’ll use three dots for ellipses and translate carefully. On P122, "تشنيع الشيخ عليّ" refers to the criticism by Shaykh ʿAlī. "اهـ" means "end quote." As for the author’s response, it discusses withdrawing from people of innovation, striking a balance between extremism and negligence. I'll ensure accuracy in translating terms like "الواجب" while maintaining clarity.

Clarifying qualifiers and principles
Subpoint b discusses a qualifier based on the understanding of the Salaf, emphasizing clear distinctions from deviants and the rash of Sunnah. Subpoint c stresses understanding the nature of disagreement. Subpoints e and d emphasize treating others with impartiality, knowledge, and forbearance. P123 clarifies misconceptions regarding deviation and presents a critical perspective on extremism.

Describing the extreme critics' behavior
The criticism describes individuals who see others as corrupting Salafi ranks and fostering schism. They focus on blaming people and labeling anyone who disagrees. They even go as far as undermining those who don't align with their views by calling them various negative terms. The phrase "Innā lillāhi wa innā ilayhi rājiʿūn" is translated as "Indeed we belong to Allah and to Him we shall return." The term "al-daʿwah al-salafiyyah" should also be mentioned.

Describing extremism and cautioning against excess or negligence
The text illustrates how extremists seek favor by attacking their opponents, including virtuous people, in order to gain closeness with Shaykh Rabīʿ. It then includes verses from the Qur'an (43:67 and 25:27-29), emphasizing that loyalty to Allah is paramount. The Shaykh warns of the dangers of both excess and negligence, urging restraint.

Reflecting on truth, perseverance, and the muwāzanāt debate
The passage emphasizes patience and trust in Allah, believing that victory comes with hardship and truth remains unaffected by noise. The phrase “kalkabn yakhruj min bayn farth wa dam” references Qur'an 16:66. It also touches on the debate about muwāzanāt, where the author denies its obligation, but the Shaykh disagrees.

Discussing blameworthy and praiseworthy muwāzanāt
The question arises whether all muwāzanāt are blameworthy or if they include both blameworthy and praiseworthy elements. There's a need for clear definitions and boundaries to avoid disputes. Some believe mentioning an innovator's good deeds leads to confusion, while others allow it for certain interests.

I'm currently focused on the source material itself, al-Difāʿ ʿan Ahl al-Ittibāʿ by Abū ʿl-Ḥasan al-Maʿribī. I'm carefully analyzing its core subject: refuting Rabī al-Madkhalī and others. The context is decidedly Islamic theology, setting the stage for a detailed examination.

Dissecting Key Theological Terms

I'm now delving into the core theological concepts underpinning the text: jarh wa ta'dil, manhaj, bida', and aqeedah. My translation prioritizes accuracy, especially for key terms. I'm ensuring proper transliteration (ALA-LC), and maintaining specific translations for 'Allah' and 'ﷺ'. A rigorous three-pass review process (Alignment, Context/Accuracy, and Transliteration) is implemented. I've begun segment-by-segment analysis. Currently, I'm focusing on P127.

Defining the Scope Further

I'm presently clarifying the meaning of "launched" and "tahāwīl" as used in the source. I'm also confirming the specific intent behind my statement concerning the need for muwāzanah. It's vital I grasp the nuances of this position regarding the People of Innovation. I'm now examining the Shaykh's critique on page 11. I'm aiming for absolute precision with these technical terms. Now, I'm working with the context of Ibn Taymiyyah's comparison of sects.

Clarifying Justice & Fairness

I've just refined my understanding of justice in this context. It appears that highlighting positive aspects is essential for fairness and isn't solely muwāzanah. I'm drawing on Ibn Taymiyyah's comparison of sects, referencing both Minhāj al-Sunnah and Siyar Aʿlām al-Nubalāʾ. Specifically, I'm examining how he balanced criticisms with acknowledgement of their followers' positive qualities. This is now focusing on examples on P130, including Aḥmad b. Ḥanbal on Ibrāhīm b. Ṭahmān (who was a Murji', but against Jahmiyyah). I'm looking at how Ibn Taymiyyah praises an innovator who refutes an even worse one, and I am noting crucial terms like Bahr al-Dam and Murji'.

Elaborating on the Analogies

I'm now diving into the "bear" analogy on P131, grasping its implications on methodology and how it relates to extremist positions. I'm noting the anecdote about the young men's rigidity concerning the term "Shaykh," even when it was used by respected scholars like Ibn Taymiyyah and Rabīʿ. The examples of Ibn Kullāb, Al-Ḥakīm al-Tirmidhī, and Rābiʿah al-ʿAdawiyyah are further illuminating the defense being presented. I'm also now processing the concluding statements on P132, where the author accuses the opposition of argumentative bankruptcy. Finally, I'm examining the statement on P133, clarifying the original intent to address both excessive and negligent groups.

Contrasting Two Scholars

I'm now fully immersed in the author's nuanced comparison of Muqbil al-Wādiʿī and Rabīʿ al-Madkhalī, carefully translating and interpreting their differing approaches. The author's strong denial of attacking Muqbil is crucial. I'm focusing on the Hadith warning of the evil of those shunned by society. The focus is on how they treat students. I am trying to grasp how the context relates to an author's previous statements.

Clarifying Nuances of Comparison

I'm now focusing on the author's responses to Rabīʿ al-Madkhalī. Specifically, I'm analyzing the context around the warning in al-Sirāj al-Wahhāj, which pertained to extremists in Yemen. I'm also carefully distinguishing between the author's stance on "justice" versus the "obligation to always mention good deeds" promoted by others. Finally, I am looking closely at his response to the accusation of insulting Salafis, which involves a contrast with Rabīʿ's harsh language.

Revising Rabīʿ's Praise

I'm now analyzing how the author turns the tables, highlighting Rabīʿ's praise of innovators. I'm noting specific examples where Rabīʿ commended the political and social contributions of certain groups, likely in the context of the Ikhwan or Tabligh. I'm carefully translating and ensuring accurate representation of this crucial point, contrasting it with the author's overall stance.

Assessing the Author's Argument

I'm now deeply engaged in dissecting the author's critique of Rabīʿ al-Madkhalī. Specifically, I'm analyzing the sections spanning pages 134-137. I'm focusing on the author's arguments, making certain I fully grasp the nuances of the author's position. This includes careful examination of the author's refutation of Rabīʿ's critiques, as well as the author's utilization of specific terminology and concepts.

I've begun by meticulously analyzing the translation request. My focus is sharpened on the role needed – a translator with specific expertise in Islamic content – and the source text itself, al-Difāʿ ʿan Ahl al-Ittibāʿ. This is essential groundwork for accurate and culturally sensitive rendering.

Detailing the Approach

I'm now fully immersed in the nuances of the task. I've defined the necessary approach: high accuracy, typically literal translation, but contextually-aware. My attention has turned toward the intricate terminology, particularly jarh wa ta'dil, manhaj, bida', and 'aqeedah. I'll adhere to the stipulated formatting (plain text) and conventions, including handling narrations and transliterations, and applying the specified Arabic usage. I'm structuring a three-stage review: Alignment, Context/Accuracy, and Transliteration. I've begun to tackle P137a, examining the source.

Evaluating the Source

I'm now deep in the process of examining the source, specifically focusing on the third group described. My draft reflects a literal interpretation, while contextual nuances begin to emerge. The author seems to quote Rabī al-Madkhalī. Key phrases like "Ḥākimiyyat Allāh" (Governance of Allah) and "Iqāmat al-Dawlah al-Islāmīyah" (Establishing the Islamic State) point to specific ideological viewpoints. I'm noting the criticism of their shortcomings in 'Aqeedah and aiming for a refined translation that balances accuracy with clarity.

Interpreting Ideologies

I'm now diving deep into the author's critique, particularly examining the Ikhwan's focus on Islamic economics and state formation. The text indicates praise for their efforts initially, but then sharply criticizes their supposed shortcomings in 'Aqeedah. This balance between acknowledgment and censure is crucial for a nuanced rendering. I'm carefully analyzing the author's use of phrases like "methods of the utmost strength" and their concern for Iqamat al-Dawlah al-Islamiyah, aiming for the right tone. I am now at the stage where I am drafting P137b.

Assessing Criticisms

I'm now grappling with the author's response to criticisms. The source text presents a direct challenge, questioning the consistency of the author's critique. I'm carefully rendering the nuances of this disagreement, particularly focusing on the use of "muwāzanah" (counter-balancing) and the implication of unfair comparison. I'm currently translating P138 and P138a, examining the author's claims and retractions.

Addressing the Objection

I'm now focused on the author's response to the original objection. The text argues against the vilification of anyone who acknowledges any good in those criticized, even minimally. I'm carefully translating P138b, which details the supposed retraction of the Shaykh's initially perceived benefit, now seen as a harm. This section is crucial for accurately conveying the nuanced debate. I'm currently working on P139, which questions the Shaykh's prior knowledge of the Salafi methodology.

Clarifying Non-Retraction

I'm now focusing on the author's argument for the Shaykh's continued stance. I'm carefully translating P139a, which cites supporting evidence from the Shaykh's other works. This confirms that the Shaykh has not retracted his position completely, but only partially. The draft delves into details within the book "Ahl al-Hadith hum al-Ta'ifah al-Mansurah al-Najiyah" (p. 41).

Assessing Conflicting Views

I'm now wrestling with the seemingly contradictory views presented. The author's positive acknowledgement of Shaykh Salmān al-ʿAwdah is intriguing, framing it as a "Salafi flash." Yet, this is juxtaposed against critiques of his stances elsewhere. This complex dynamic, alongside the discussion on Taqlīd and its consequences, requires careful handling. I'm focusing on accurately translating P140, capturing the tension between praise and criticism.

Analyzing the Criticism

I'm now examining the author's argument regarding Rabīʿ's use of Sayyid Qutb's words. I find it fascinating that the author alleges this tactic constitutes Muwāzanah, using an innovator's words selectively. This analysis extends to the author's interpretation of Rabīʿ's actions and the implied critiques within. I am at P140, focusing on the defense of his methodology and the complex relationship between affiliation to the Sunnah and judgment of methodologies.

Clarifying Methodologies

I'm presently focusing on the nuances of the author's critique, specifically the distinction between general rulings and specific judgments regarding individuals' methodologies. I'm translating P141, grappling with the assertion that defaming the Ahl al-Hadith is zandaqah if done to undermine their defense of the Prophet's Sunnah. The ongoing analysis explores the author's intent, contrasting a general critique of methodology with accusations of heresy.

Refining Interpretations

I'm now diving into the author's argument regarding the conditions for criticizing Ahl al-Hadith. I'm translating the quotes from al-Dhahabi and al-Barqani, along with Shaykh Muqbil's strong words, as the crux of the debate centers on intent and motive. It seems that the author argues that not all critics are equal; only those defaming the scholars with malicious intent are accused of Zandaqah. I'm carefully rendering the nuances of this position within the context of the source. Currently translating P142, I am at the point of translating "كل هذا مع ما ثبت في حق الأنصار...".

Analyzing Retractions

I'm now focusing on the author's response to prior criticisms and retractions. The text analyzes how the author modified specific phrases after initial critique. I'm translating P143a, P143b, and P143c. It seems Rabīʿ still perceives praise and muwāzanāt despite revisions. This raises questions about the definition of "praise" and the boundaries of critique within Salafi discourse. The debate continues regarding the intent and the impact of the author's writings. I am currently working through the last bit of P143c, focusing on the author's response to the critique of his statements.

Elaborating on Nuances

I'm now deep into the author's nuanced perspective on criticism and engagement with dissenting voices. I'm carefully translating P144, focusing on the author's assertion that adhering to established principles, such as "Repelling harms takes precedence over bringing benefits" and "Blocking the means," could have prevented many from falling into the traps of Bid'ah. I'm also grappling with the contrasting view, attributed to Rabīʿ, that the writings of the Salaf are sufficient and that the books of Bid'ah are inherently dangerous. I've begun P145.

Analyzing Restrictive Views

I'm now carefully rendering the author's nuanced perspective on the application of his judgments. The author explicitly states his intent is to clarify and place restrictions on the use of his critiques, referring to the Quranic verse Al-Furqan 25:33. I've conducted a thorough term check, particularly for Muwāzanah, and ensured accurate transliterations and formatting. I'm focusing on "different scales," implying double standards in criticism, and ensuring all IDs are preserved.

Addressing Heresies

I'm now grappling with the author's precise definition of Zindīq (heretic) and the concept of "Throwing ash in the eyes" ("ذر الرماد في العيون") as a form of deception. I'm finalizing the translation, ensuring the nuances of these terms are accurately rendered. I've now completed the initial alignment pass, and am about to conduct the contextual clarity pass, before verifying transliterations. I'm focusing on ensuring the argumentative flow against Rabīʿ's critique is clear.

For this translation, the instruction says to apply ALA-LC transliteration only to names of narrators in a chain. But there aren't any narrators specifically here—just names of scholars—which leaves me wondering if I should transliterate them anyway. I think the safest approach is to stick with conventional transliteration for those names.

Translating with attention to handling names and narration chains
The instruction is clear—it specifies transliterating only the names of narrators in a chain using ALA-LC. For non-narrator names, like Ibn Bāz, those can be rendered in their common English forms. But to avoid errors and ensure accuracy, I'm thinking it’s safest to stick to ALA-LC transliteration for all names, despite the instructions.

Choosing transliteration for Arabic names
They didn’t specify how to handle names outside of isnad, but it seems like transliterating Arabic names using ALA-LC is the standard approach. Since no other markers are provided, I’ll use ALA-LC consistently for names like Shaykh Rabīʿ and ensure to follow the diacritical rules (like macrons and dots). No Arabic characters will appear in the final text.

Handling Islamic terms and maintaining consistency
For the Islamic terms, I’ll follow the general guidance to carefully use the terminology. Terms like السلف (Salaf), منهج (manhaj), and البدعة (bidʿah) will be transliterated appropriately. When translating larger phrases, like "manhaj al-muwāzanāt," I’ll prioritize clarity and accuracy while maintaining technical terms where needed. Numeric markers like "P145a - ٢ -" will be preserved as they are.

Handling Arabic numerals and specific translation rules
I need to remove Arabic numerals like "٢", but keep Arabic text segment identifiers like "P145a". Since Arabic digits are considered Arabic characters, I’ll convert Eastern Arabic numerals to Western ones (e.g., ٢ to 2). I’ll also replace references like "ص ١٣" with "p. 13", ensuring no Arabic digits remain. "الله" will be translated as "Allah," and publisher names will be transliterated.

Translating phrases and terms consistently
When the phrase "رسول الله - صلى الله عليه وسلم -" appears, I’ll translate it as "- ﷺ -", as instructed. For "كتاب «شذرات البلاتين»", I’ll transliterate it to "Shadharāt al-Balāṭīn" while preserving the quotes. Regarding the principle about interpreting speech, "عدم تأويل كلام غير المعصوم" translates to "not making taʾwīl of the speech of someone who is not infallible".

Understanding scholarly transmission and disputes
P146 discusses how taking from opponents does not mean relying less on the Qur'an, Sunnah, or Ahl al-Sunnah, as we only accept what aligns with these sources. The Salaf didn’t avoid transmitting from opponents but valued truth over alliances. There’s mention of a Jewish scholar’s criticism regarding swearing by the Kaʿbah.

Clarifying scholarly perspectives and qualifications
P146b mentions that scholars didn’t object to a paragraph in the book, suggesting Shaykh Rabīʿ’s claim wasn’t accurate. To prevent misuse by the unqualified, a phrase was added in the printed edition stating it’s permissible to cite opposing views—but only for qualified individuals. Questions arise about whether the claim was a misjudgment or necessary clarification.

Clarifying quotes and definitions
On p. 153, the author clarifies the goal isn’t to agree with everything said by scholars like the mutakallimūn, but to mention their words when they align with the truth. Then there's a reflection from Muʿādh indicating this. Also, Ibn al-Qayyim’s quote from Madārij al-Sālikīn suggests clarity—"The Truth" refers to Allah, and his statement is highly regarded.

Translating polygamy quote
I’m translating a quote from Shaykh Ibn Bāz quoting Muḥammad Rashīd Riḍā in al-Manār. There's a phrase "لله در العالم (توس)", which refers to someone called "Tūs." I'm not sure if it's a French name "Tousse" or something else, but I’ll go with "Tūs" for clarity. The quote discusses the scholar’s perspective on polygamy as a solution to societal issues, particularly in relation to European norms.

Reflecting on Shaykh Ibn Bāz and quoted scholars’ words
Shaykh Ibn Bāz quoted sources like Riḍā and western writers, even while acknowledging potential flaws in their beliefs. He believed some may benefit more from these sources than from traditional Islamic scholars due to their view of the West. Ibn Bāz focused on accepting truth, acknowledging differences in methodology.

I've initiated the translation process, starting with a deep dive into the source text. I'm focusing on "al-Difāʿ ʿan Ahl al-Ittibāʿ" by Abū ʿl-Ḥasan al-Maʿribī. The goal is a faithful rendition.

Examining Textual Nuances

I'm now zeroing in on the text's core nature. It's a critique of Rabīʿ al-Madkhalī. My target is English speakers curious about Islamic theology and methodology. I intend to maintain a professional, precise tone, keeping the technical vocabulary intact. Literal translation is preferred, except where context necessitates a meaning-based approach. I'll maintain the full isnad and the ALA-LC transliteration. "Allah" for "God", and "ﷺ" for the Prophet (PBUH) will be used. Also, I'm working on segment P165, where it discusses cooperation with innovators for a maṣlaḥah.

Analyzing Preponderant Interests

I'm now closely examining the concept of maṣlaḥah rājiḥah and its application, particularly concerning cooperation with groups. I'm referencing the Standing Committee Fatwa, which highlights the complexities of dealing with various groups like the Muslim Brotherhood. My draft translation of the principle is complete, and I'm now comparing its stance with a Hadith and verse of the Quran in the context of cooperating with innovators. I have a reference from Ibn Baz regarding the National Islamic Front.

Exploring Cooperation Principles

I'm now delving into the author's defense of his stance on parliaments, specifically focusing on the principle of maṣlaḥah. My draft translation of the passage (P167) is underway, highlighting the author's existing, detailed views on the topic, distinct from extremism or negligence. I'm also considering Albānī's position, which cautioned against elections but mandated cooperation in righteousness. Ibn ʿUthaymīn's support for cooperation with Dawah groups, even while addressing errors, is also influencing my approach. The nuances surrounding the conditions and constraints of cooperation, are also being addressed.

Assessing Cooperation Conditions

I'm presently focusing on the precise conditions for cooperative efforts, particularly as articulated by the author, and contrasting those with the views of Muqbil ibn Hādī al-Wādiʿī. The emphasis is on safeguarding against partisan exploitation and ensuring that cooperation doesn't compromise the integrity of Ahl al-Sunnah's dawah. I'm carefully weighing these conditions, drawing upon the author's comparisons with broader principles concerning interactions with both disbelievers and innovators. The discussion is now moving toward a challenge directed at Rabīʿ al-Madkhalī.

Debating Cooperation's Boundaries

I'm now carefully examining the author's critique of Rabīʿ al-Madkhalī's stance on cooperation. Rabīʿ limits it to wartime, but I'm questioning whether the principle extends beyond this. I'm referencing Ibn Taymiyyah's perspective, which permits utilizing knowledge from innovators if neglecting it risks the Sunnah. I'm also considering Verse 5:2, which doesn't seem to restrict this general principle. Furthermore, I'm analyzing the author's refutation of Rabīʿ's claim that such cooperation is difficult or impossible, examining arguments regarding both self-imposed challenges and potential legal or real-world obstacles. I'm also exploring the argument that distortions of "righteousness" shouldn't invalidate the principle when applied within its proper boundaries and conditions.

Expanding Cooperative Scope

I'm now analyzing the author's arguments regarding cooperation, specifically focusing on rebutting Rabīʿ al-Madkhalī's limitations, particularly related to the Imams' practices and the Prophet's ﷺ precedents. The author's discussion about cooperation with groups for shared benefits forms the basis. The argument challenges the notion of absolute exclusion and highlights instances where Imams and even the Prophet ﷺ engaged in strategic partnerships. I'm carefully examining the necessity argument and weighing the author's nuanced perspective on the matter.

Clarifying Cooperative Nuances

I'm now clarifying the author's nuances on cooperation. It's not about compromise or permanent alliances. It's a needs-based measure. I'm focusing on the author's defense against Rabīʿ's critique on his "Sunnah without tashnīʿ" stance. I'm analyzing the author's prior warnings against innovations and how he distinguishes between necessary refutation and unjust insults/exaggeration, highlighting Rabīʿ's one-sided criticism. I'm noting the balance between firm refutation and preventing the "watering down" of principles, highlighting the author's critique of Rabīʿ's selective focus on opponents.

Addressing Excess Criticism

I'm now analyzing the author's critique of excessive criticism (jarḥ). I see a parallel between the Khawārij and contemporary zealotry. Rabīʿ al-Madkhalī's followers, in my view, are now overly focused on jarḥ, often neglecting core Islamic knowledge. This current situation is likened to a glimmer of fire within ashes. Also, I'm verifying the translation accuracy and checking specific page numbers against the original Arabic, confirming each phrase in the text.

Confirming Text Accuracy

I'm presently focused on the text's precise rendition. I'm verifying the accuracy of the translations and ensuring consistency throughout the document. The current stage involves cross-checking segments with the original Arabic and ensuring the correct use of technical terminology. I'm making sure that "narrated to us" is consistently used for the chains. Also, I'm ensuring all the names, including the transliterations, are accurate.

Considering translation of Arabic text without Arabic characters
The user asked to translate Arabic text but emphasized not including Arabic characters except for ﷺ. For translations, I’ll follow the ALA-LC for names in chains of narration, but since these names don’t appear in chains of narration, I’ll stick with the common English versions for names.

Deciding on transliteration approach for names
The requirement is to use ALA-LC transliteration solely for names in narration chains, not for other names. However, for consistency, I’ll use common English forms for non-narrator names, like "Shaykh al-Islām Ibn Taymiyyah" but keeping transliteration without diacritics, and avoiding Arabic characters.

Determining transliteration approach for Islamic names and IDs
The user likely expects diacritics and ALA-LC for specific names, but since they only explicitly mentioned using ALA-LC for narrators in chains, I’ll avoid using diacritics for other names. For example, I'll write "Abu al-Hasan" and "Shaykh Rabi',” while keeping numeric markers like P177 as is at the beginning of each segment.

Deciding on numeric format for IDs
The user has specified that IDs like "P177 - ٥ -" should be kept as is. But since Arabic-Indic digits might count as Arabic characters, I’m unsure whether to convert them. They asked not to correct numeric prefixes, so I'll keep the IDs intact, despite the Arabic-Indic digits, to stay compliant.

Translating and preserving terminology
To follow instructions, I'll convert Arabic-Indic numerals (e.g., ٥ to 5). For verse references like [النحل: ١٢٥], I'll transliterate names (e.g., [al-Nahl: 125]) since it's not Arabic script. I'll also include translations for Qur'anic verses and preserve terms like "Allah", "aqidah", and "manhaj" where appropriate, based on their specific meanings.

Translating terms and keeping technical language
For "Ahl al-Sunnah wa al-Jama'ah," I’ll keep it as is because it’s a technical term, even though the instruction says "no Arabic characters." I'll translate verses and couplets, preferring literal meaning over rhyming. For Arabic punctuation and footnotes, like "اهـ." or "قلت:", I'll translate and convert Arabic-Indic numbers to Western digits where necessary, ensuring accuracy.

Translating specific phrases and names
The phrase "And I call to the 'aqidah and manhaj of Ahl al-Sunnah wa al-Jama'ah" indicates a call to unity without vilification. The terms "الهلالين" can be interpreted as "the two parentheses," and I'll go with that translation. For names like "Kusayer" and "Uwayr," I'll use transliteration, as they're not part of the chain.

Translating names, principles, and quotes
For names like كُسَيْر وعُوَيْر, I'll transliterate as "Kusayr" and "Uwayr," since the diacritics aren't needed. I'll also translate phrases on righteous brothers, leniency, harshness, and issues of ijtihad. For Quranic references, including those from Ibn Taymiyyah, I'll provide translations while keeping the quotes intact, respecting context.

Translating scholarly discussions and principles
The discussion involves foundational matters, so no need for examples. I'll translate quotes from Ibn Taymiyyah while maintaining their emphasis. I'll also address key terms like "qat'i" (definitive) and "zanni" (probabilistic). The author stresses forbearance, avoiding ignorance, and clarifying differences in definitive versus probabilistic issues.

Clarifying justice, truth, and the path of Ahl al-Sunnah
The text explains that Ahl al-Sunnah are advocates of justice. It includes quotes from Ibn Taymiyyah about justice in judgment and reflects the importance of accepting truth while rejecting falsehood. The author emphasizes that following the correct path from Ahl al-Sunnah, guided by scholars, prevents falling into fitnah.

Resolving citation and translation issues
The text discusses a hadith about a lost camel, with a translation needed. The system requires a citation, yet the user asks for plain text with no formatting. I'll include the citation in plain text at

Clarifying reference markers and ensuring consistency
I need to include the relevant text from P178, right after P177. It’s important to keep the reference markers as they are, like P177 - 5, P180 - 7 etc., and correctly format the text accordingly. I’ll double-check that these align with the full text and ensure no Arabic characters, including curly braces, are kept in the translation.

Translating with consistent English terms
I need to make sure Arabic words are translated into proper English without including Arabic punctuation. For example, "عزوجل" should be "the Mighty and Majestic" and "رحمه الله" becomes "may Allah have mercy on him". I'll also translate terms like "إن شاء الله تعالى" as "if Allah Most High wills" and treat "حاشية" as "footnote".

Translating with clarity and accuracy
I'll say “What was between the two crescent brackets (i.e., parentheses) I added...” to avoid using Arabic terms. For the phrase "وأدعو إلى الاجتماع بلا تمييع", I'll translate it as “I call to unity without watering down (the religion)” or “without laxity/dilution.” For "تشنيع", I'll go with "vilification" as the translation for "denouncing" or "defamation".

Clarifying translation and maintaining context
He says, "It is not part of vilification to warn against falsehood and its people, as the Salaf of the Ummah were upon." I'll keep this phrasing. For "عمل الأحزاب العصرية، والكتل السرية", I'll translate it as "the activity of contemporary parties and secret blocs." Then, "التي فرّقت الأمة" becomes "that have split the Ummah." I'll also clarify the portion within the parentheses to prevent any misconception.

Translating the Shaykh's Criticism and Context
The Shaykh says in his "criticism" on p. 15, footnote 28: "I say now: Indeed this is a shameful insinuation...” I'll translate "غمز" as insinuation or slur and "شنيع" as vile, resulting in "vile insinuation." Other relevant translations include "support for the slanders of their opponents" and "his aim is to present himself as distinguished from Ahl al-Sunnah."

Translating Salafi-related Terms and Criticism
In their gatherings, faith strengthens, souls are purified, and dignity ascends. It's an honor to be with this blessed group, and I pray to live and be resurrected with Ahl al-Hadith, the victorious Salafi sect. Shaykh Rabi' views responses as vile insinuations and slanders against Salafi callers.

Translating Quran and Islamic Principles
The phrase refers to observing fruits in every land and finding disappointment in most, similar to the Quranic verse "ارجع البصر مرتين." This suggests the fruitlessness of seeking things twice. The writer explains exceptions: noble brothers defending the Sunnah, facing differing opinions on benefits and harms.

Affirming proper discourse with evidence
The text emphasizes that Allah commands respectful debate, even with non-Muslims, and mentions how insults are not a productive response. Citing Ibn Taymiyyah, the author stresses focusing on evidence over insult, showcasing the importance of clear arguments in debates, especially when addressing truth versus falsehood.

Emphasizing the balance of gentleness and severity
The text argues that while gentleness is important, severity also has a place, and both need to be applied appropriately. It critiques recklessness and negligence. Using a poignant metaphor, the author explains the harm of misplaced actions, like applying generosity where firmness is needed and vice versa.

Addressing differences in opinion and methodology
The shaykh emphasizes that it's not permissible to disagree without knowledge and proof, especially on matters like 'aqidah. He critiques people who push for "etiquette of disagreement" while being harsh toward Ahl al-Sunnah. The author reflects on brevity and the context of laying down principles, not offering examples, and points out how scholars endorsed the approach.

Discussing Islamic disagreements and the principle of justice
The author highlights scholarly debates, explaining that differences arise from the evidence pulling in different directions. The Companions didn't declare others misguided for differing on ijtihad. Emphasizing the importance of knowledge and justice, the author criticizes weak arguments while advocating for a balanced approach in accepting what is true and rejecting falsehood across groups.

Exploring scholarly balances, criticism, and methodology
The author stresses openness in accepting both truths and errors within different groups, advocating knowledge based on justice and not ignorance. They emphasize leaving room for beneficial knowledge without clinging blindly to obsolete principles. The quote critiques those who misinterpret criticism and disregard necessary religious methodology.

I need to translate Arabic to English with accuracy, including Islamic technical terms. I'll avoid Arabic characters except for ﷺ. The transliteration should use ALA-LC for narrators’ names in chains, but these scholars’ names like ابن تيمية aren’t narrators in a chain. Maybe I should transliterate all personal names in general?

Clarifying transliteration guidelines for names and text
The user specifies ALA-LC transliteration only for narrators in chains, not the textual content. Outside of chains, using standard English renderings might be fine, but they also want no Arabic. I’m considering using ALA-LC for all names for consistency, but it might go against their request to limit it to narrators.

Translating Quran verses and handling references
There are Quranic verses that contain Arabic, which we need to translate. The Arabic text should be removed, but references like [al-Baqarah: 286] must remain. There is also a corrupted verse in Arabic that needs to be corrected and translated for meaning, while keeping the numeric markers intact in the segments.

Handling IDs and numeral translations
For IDs like "P184" or "P184a", I'll keep them as they are. However, numeric prefixes in Arabic numerals (like ١) need to be converted to Latin digits (1). The same goes for letters in Arabic scripts, like (أ); these should be converted to (a) or (A), keeping the order intact.

Translating technical terms and handling markers
For the Arabic letter markers like (أ), I'll convert them to Latin letters like (a) or (b) to avoid Arabic characters. Transliteration for technical terms like "manhaj" could be challenging. Though the user prefers literal translations for context, I might need to translate terms like "manhaj" as "methodology" while mentioning the Arabic version for accuracy.

Translating terms and handling titles
For technical terms like "manhaj," I'll translate them as "methodology," and "bidʿah" as "innovation (in religion)". Arabic titles like "Minhāj al-Sunnah al-Nabawiyyah" will likely stay in transliteration, but I'll make sure to mention standard translations where it's applicable. “Allah” and religious terms like "ﷺ" will be handled carefully, respecting the user's preferences.

Translating Islamic names and endings
When translating Islamic quotes, I’ll use "end of quote" for "اهـ." and transliterate names like "Muḥammad ibn al-Ṭayyib al-Ḥanbalī" using ALA-LC rules. For example, "Abū Dharr" and "Ibn Taymīyah" will be romanized as per ALA-LC guidelines, aiming to balance accuracy in transliteration while avoiding Arabic characters.

Translating Arabic names and terms
I’ll transliterate Arabic names, like "Abū Naṣr al-Sijzī" and "Ibn Khuzaymah," following standard conventions. I’ll keep terms like "Jahmiyyah" and "Muʿtazilah" in Latin script without Arabic letters. For verses, I’ll retain the Arabic citation format but may mention any corrections in translation.

Translating specific Arabic terms and names
I'll convert the Arabic names and terms like "Yaḥyā ibn Yaḥyā" into the appropriate transliterations using diacritics. For Arabic phrases such as "may Allah guide him," they’ll be translated as "may Allah grant him well-being" or similar. I’ll also handle punctuation carefully, ensuring no Arabic digits or punctuation marks interfere with the translation.

Handling Arabic punctuation, references, and terms
I need to ensure I don't reproduce Arabic punctuation like commas or semicolons, using English punctuation instead. I’ll also convert Arabic digits into Western numbers. For technical terms, I'll transliterate when necessary, for example, using "muwāzanāt" (balancing) but later simplifying just as "manhaj of muwāzanāt". Some terms like "ghulāt" will be left as transliterations, while others like "the Salaf" will retain their meaning in translation.

Translating text and commentary segment by segment
I’ll handle the translation piece by piece, making sure to convert important phrases like "منهاج السنة النبوية" into a transliteration. I’ll also translate poetic lines as verses. When translating, I’ll aim for accuracy, including the nuances of the segments, such as the part about Shaykh al-Islām Ibn Taymiyyah and his views. I'll preserve footnotes and any commentary according to the provided guidelines.

Translating complex segments and ensuring accuracy
I’ll break down the translation, ensuring terms like "manhaj of muwāzanāt" are well-translated and clarified as needed. I'll need to carefully translate quotes and footnotes, including verses and specific references like al-Baqarah: 286. Also, I must maintain important context around Ibn Taymiyyah’s teachings and keep all translations accurate and in line with previously noted formatting for special terms.

For standard names, I’m considering using ALA-LC, but the instructions are specific about that. It seems best to transliterate names in chains using ALA-LC, but avoid doing so for other parts, unless asked otherwise. They might want accuracy for narrators' names while keeping the rest in conventional English without diacritics.

Balancing transliteration rules for names
The instructions say to use ALA-LC for narrators in the chain, but do not mention other names. To be safe, I’ll use non-diacritic transliterations for other names, like "Rabi' al-Madkhali," while sticking to ALA-LC for narrators. For non-isnad names, I'll avoid using diacritics and follow common English spellings for clarity.

Translating segments with citation guidelines
I’ll translate the Quran verses corresponding to the specified IDs (P220, P222, etc.) and ensure the citation is properly included at the end, as plain text with no additional formatting. I’ll use "Muḥammad ﷺ" and retain diacritics for Arabic letters, but if no diacritics are requested, I’ll opt for simpler translations.

Transliteration approach for names in text
Since the instruction is to use ALA-LC for narrators in the isnad only, I’ll avoid diacritics for names outside the chain, like "Muhammad" without diacritics. For names like "Rabiʿ," I’ll use an apostrophe for the ayn (ʿ) and keep transliterations simple, such as "Rabi' al-Madkhali" and "Ibn Taymiyyah."

Deciding on transliteration for technical terms
For accuracy, I’ll use "ʿ" and "ā" for proper transliterations like "Abu al-Hasan al-Ma'ribi," but avoid ALA-LC outside the chain. I'll translate names without macrons, using apostrophes for certain Arabic letters. Technical terms like "jarh wa ta'dil" will be transliterated, but I'll avoid Arabic characters unless specified otherwise. I'll keep formatting consistent with point numbers and Quran references as instructed.

Deciding on translation approach
I'll translate terms like "al-jarh wa al-ta'dil" and "ahl al-bida'" directly to maintain technical accuracy. For terms like "manhaj" and "aqidah," I'll use transliteration unless the context suggests otherwise, like "creed" for "aqidah." I'll avoid Arabic script and convert Eastern Arabic digits to Western. I'll ensure IDs remain the same, and for references, I'll ensure (website) inclusion at the end.

Planning for P231 translation
I've determined that P231 has 12 lines, and now I need to translate everything carefully to reflect those. I'll break it into segments, aiming to preserve paragraph breaks, following the user's request for plain text. I'll also properly format poem lines as separate lines, point numbering, and any verses with references. For the basmala, I'll treat it as a heading and provide the translation before continuing. I'll also append citations at the end per system requirements, even if the user didn't specifically ask for them.

Ensuring accurate Quran verse translations
For the Quran translations, I'll strive for precision, preserving the meaning. In verses like Q 7:128, where certain phrases are repeated, I'll maintain that repetition, particularly with "al-'aqibah." For verses like Q 28:83 and 28:5, I'll ensure similar precision, especially where repetition occurs, possibly using brackets or adjusting as needed. I'll also carefully handle indented or quoted phrasing for consistency.

Translating Quran verses with attention to repetition
For accurate translation, I'll focus on maintaining the integrity of repeated phrases. For instance, in Q 7:137, where "Bani Isra'il" is repeated, I'll translate it as "the Children, the Children of Israel." Likewise, in Q 32:24, where "yūqinūn" is repeated, I'll emphasize the repetition with "they had certainty, they had certainty" to preserve the original structure and meaning.

Translating Quran verses with attention to repetition and context
For Q 12:18, I’ll keep the meaning of "so patience is beautiful" intact. In Q 83:4-6, I’ll emphasize the idea of resurrection and standing before the Lord. For Q 19:96, I’ll preserve the repetition of "al-Rahman." For Q 38:88 and Q 50:37, I’ll maintain clarity of context and meaning in the translation.

Translating nuanced phrases while keeping style consistent
For the phrase "وكم بين السراب والشراب", I’ll translate as "How far between mirage and drink!" to capture the meaning and rhetorical tone. I'll also preserve expressions like "!!!" for exclamations. For the Quranic reference, I'll use "a mirage the thirsty think is water until they reach it." Translating titles like the tapes will keep transliteration simple while respecting the requested style.

Translating titles and phrases to balance clarity with accuracy
For the title "al-Qawl al-Amin fi Sadd al-ʿUdwan al-Mubin," I think translating it fully as "The Trustworthy Statement in Repelling the Manifest Aggression" is probably the best choice to avoid the complications of diacritics while maintaining accuracy. I'll stick with the simple "Ibn al-Wazir" for names and keep translations clear and straightforward with terms like "the Prophet's city" or "May Allah rectify me and them."

Translating key concepts and preserving meaning accurately
I'll ensure phrases like "الصبر على ظلمهم" are translated as "being patient with their oppression," keeping context intact. For technical terms like "ghuluww" and "tashayyuʿ," I’ll use transliterations. When using "Allah," I’ll stay consistent, avoiding "God." For Arabic symbols like "««««," I’ll treat those as quotation marks and preserve punctuation like "!!". Then, I’ll ensure all references are clearly translated with proper verse mentions.

Handling citation and translation details carefully
I'll omit curly braces around verses and ensure hyphen remains after the segment ID, as in “P228 - In the Name...”. Chapter headings will stay lowercase as requested. For citing the source, I’ll follow the requirement and place it unobtrusively at the end of the final segment. I'll make sure the translation flows smoothly.

Translating figurative speech and expressions carefully
For some phrases, like "its necks have stretched high," I’ll stick with a literal translation, although that might be figurative. "The forms and names of its men have varied" will also be translated distinctly, reflecting those stirring up fitnah. I’ll keep "a person must not make concessions with his religion" and others as closely aligned to their meaning.

Translating complex expressions and thoughts on truth
The second type of "metals" fearlessly recognizes truth but struggles with confronting falsehood. They bow to avoid conflict but eventually, the waves of fitnah toss them into supporting falsehood. On P229, I’ll start with "To Allah we belong..." and translate guidance through different verses. This teaches patience and sincerity before Allah.
